"Amazing that this film came out nearly twenty years ago (1995) and it took me this long to finally watch it! Cry, the Beloved Country came out one year following the South African Apartheid reforms in 1994. This was when the separatist approach to syphoning off and separating non-Europeans from Europeans in that part of the world was finally overruled. Apartheid was literally a systematic and structured social institution in South African society bent on upholding the idea that Blacks, Whites and other ethnicities were not only unequal but were not to intermingle with each other socially (or any other way). The culture of Johannesburg, the townships and other areas was one of intensity, violence and oppression. In the wake of the reforms, Truth & Reconciliation Commissions took place. This was the opportunity for victims of this enforced racism to give testimony as to the violence they had experienced. Blacks speaking of unbelievable human rights violations and other atrocities, White preachers speaking of torture and acts of aggression and violence against their person.Cry, the Beloved Country is set in 1946 and the rolling hills of the nation are a beautiful backdrop for less than beautiful acts of hatred between people, as well as the stoicism and bravery that peace loving men continue to uphold in the face of darkness and discouragement. Two fathers (James Earl Jones and Richard Harris) are brought together due to tragic circumstances. One is a preacher of peace and the other is a wealthy landowner. They are also from different backgrounds at a time where it is unheard of for Blacks and Whites to barely speak to each other. In spite of the turbulence, they make space for a peaceful bond to build - almost like an oasis for reconciliation.The acting is superb, the beautiful landscape is so rich with color and dimension and it transfers so well to the television screen. This is definitely not a film that requires going to the movie theater for full effect. I wish more films existed like this. The times are so difficult and director Darrell James Roodt beautifully recreates the novel written by Alan Paton with his actors. Don't miss this gem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D3DDPPQOBQX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GRF3DG#wasThisHelpful","R1D3DDPPQOBQX1","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The time? 1947. The location? Japan post-war time. The plot? Two young lovers for their weekly Sunday date with barely enough money to scrape by for an outing of any sort. The young man, Yuzo (Isao Numasaki), is a returning soldier from the war that his country lost. His beautiful girlfriend, Masako (Chieko Nakakita) is doing everything in her power to make him feel that they should not allow money to stand in their way of happiness. Yet, Yuzo is still miserable. The world provides examples of its cruelty in their encounters with it, over the course of a twelve hour period. There are moments of intense joy and heart blistering pain. The couple looks at a house that is up for sale that they cannot afford on their combined salaries. Even simple things like Yuzo meeting up with an old army buddy blow up in their faces. Yet, through their ups and downs, the two young people have a fierce determination and demonstrate true grit throughout their journey.The actors glows, the plot is engaging and it is truly refreshing to see two main characters who are of good moral character, want to be happy at all costs and are full of imagination and life. Isao Numasaki reminds me of a Japanese Jimmy Stewart and this film has been compared to the films of Frank Capra, for whom Stewart starred in several pictures. Hard to say who influenced who! This film was made in 1947 after all. The cinematography makes one forget that this was shot in black and white. It is like looking at a gorgeous painting done by filmmaker and painter Akira Kurosawa. Even the rolling leaves in the wind take on a certain ethereal quality. Amazing and totally underrated. Please see this masterful piece. I guarantee you it will make you happy to be alive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJMQRK1GX2YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QM474I#wasThisHelpful","R1PJMQRK1GX2YJ","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The beauty of See What I'm Saying: The Extraordinary Powers of Our Five Senses is that it takes a really in depth and engaging look at how the effect of (or lack thereof) certain abilities can actually contribute to the heightened gifts of the others to counterbalance deficiencies. The examples the author, Lawrence D. Rosenblaum, uses are so interesting. He talks about a blind man who has the ability to guide seeing people in the woods, for example. We also learn about restaurants that specialize in serving their guests in the dark. Fascinating.

"Amazing to think that The Flowers of St. Francis was made in 1950 and in black and white! As we watched on St. Francis' patron saint day, the vivid cinematography felt like it was majestically colorful. This is due to the beautiful lighting and camera work. The ""natural"" performances by the men portraying the friars who were disciples of the peace loving St. Francis for whom the ""sowing the seeds of peace"" was received in divine connection with God, were actual monks! Amazing. Also, each vignette gives the viewer a sense of the beautiful messages of love, selflessness and kindness and how they were conveyed in the humble deeds of St. Francis (Brother Nazario Gerardi). He sowed the seeds of compassion and love in all situations. An inspiration for us all.

"This is a classic book written by rapper/actor/activist Ice T. He has come a long way since the 1990s. God**** was he angry about so many things then. I think he still has very strong opinions and perspectives about life and its variety. This takes on hard topics like gang violence, sexuality, and racism. Every passage ends with ""Who gives a ****?"" My personal favorite section is entitled ""They should've killed me last year."" Ice T looks like he did ""it"" (whatever that is).

"This 2012 follow up by Regina Spektor is wonderful, humorous and even interplanetary. We go on a quest with Ms. Spektor as she takes us on a tour of a museum (""All the Rowboats""), a mafia family (""Oh Marcello""), Paris (""Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas)""), and a whole slew of other places, faces and mindsets. The piano has never sounded better, Regina is top notch, vocally speaking, and her jokes and platitudes are fast, furious, ironic and even sexy. Love this woman.

"Regina Spektor is one of the most gifted musicians I have ever heard - hands down. The woman can play piano marvelously, she can mimic virtually any accent or singer, and has a marvelous flair for storytelling. Two of my favorite pieces off of this album are ""Eet"" and ""Dance Anthem of the 80s."" They are catchy, poetic and really interesting. There aren't words in the English vocabulary to describe how other worldly this woman's music is. She is not a folk singer. She is not a punk singer. She is not a classical pianist per se (though she has classical piano training). This is a great introduction to Regina Spektor's music for newcomers and a great follow up for her lifelong fan base.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CRC76FPMN6BG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00204AA0O#wasThisHelpful","R2CRC76FPMN6BG","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Acai Berry and Tropical Water is a newer scent from Softsoap's line of body washes. It blends the strong and sweet scent of acai berry with a note of what I would describe as being comparable to coconut. In all honesty, I am not sure what tropical water is or is supposed to be. The moisture beads melt into your skin under the warmth of the shower water. You feel like you are cleansing and moisturizing your skin at the simultaneously. A little of this body wash definitely goes a long way. I feel like I am taking a trip to the spa whenever I use this bath product.

"I haven't really used deodorant sprays in the past. Usually, I stick to the stick. Since I have really made a conscious effort to avoid deodorants with aluminum it has been challenging to find long lasting, effective and natural alternatives. My deodorants tend to expire quickly after application. I decided I needed to rethink the brand and type of deodorant I am gravitating toward for effective protection. I have been very pleased with EO products in the past (Hand Soap, body wash, etc). So, I thought I would give their vetiver spray a try. This product is a bit on the strong side. You can definitely smell the bergamot notes blended with grapefruit and lavender. One has to be a little careful about applying it after shaving under your arms. Since this has an alcohol base it burns like crazy! So, don't apply directly to broken or freshly shaved skin. Just as a note. Also, a little goes a long way. The smell is very herbal and is definitely not for everyone. Chalk it up to the essential oils. This is still well worth it. I layer this on top of my deodorant stick application and I feel good to go for the day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DNF09I33IKR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XRLU0C#wasThisHelpful","R2DNF09I33IKR2","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Viewing Sanshiro Sugata is a great way to acquaint oneself with the early works of the late, great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. This film takes a look at the rivalry between the martial arts judo and jujitsu. The young title character (sensitively played by Susumu Fujita) is headstrong and determined to learn the ways of judo. He encounters rivals along the way and even the beautiful daughter of a jujitsu rival. The cinematography is luscious. Filmed in crisp black & white, the attention paid to subtle details and variations in light and contrast make this film a treat for the eyes. The action sequences are exciting to watch and are staged like an intricate dance and demonstration of the forces of nature. Amazing to think that this was Kurosawa's directorial debut! Executed like a true professional and only the beginning of a marvelous career in visual storytelling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJLDX6GARM6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6304391900#wasThisHelpful","R1PJLDX6GARM6X","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So much has been said about Silver Linings Playbook (both good and bad). In an effort not to be redundant or repetitive about just how brilliant this film is I will take a slightly different angle in its analysis. For starters, the acting is stellar and right on point with depicting the struggles of living with bipolar and manic depression. The main characters (brilliantly played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) are forced to confront their demons and all the while learn from each other about coping with ups and downs. Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from a state institution, as part of a plea bargain after violently assaulting a man in the throws with his wife. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is a young widow who suffers with the very same condition he deals with. Medicines have not worked well for either of them. Their inner anguish is badly stigmatized by those around them and their erratic behavior badly impairs their social lives and connection with the world around them. Still, their insight and inability to filter (in the words of Pat) provide them with a rare insight into the world that others do not have. Some may call it insight. I call it a badly broken kind of brilliance. Pat's mantra is ""excelsior."" This fuels his wish to find the silver lining in every situation in his life - good or bad.In spite of the restraining order that Pat's wife has against him, he wishes to give a letter to her anyway. Tiffany will deliver the letter on the condition that he practice and be part of a dance competition with her as her partner. This arrangement paves the way to an interesting series of developments. Not planning to give away any more plot details beyond this. If you want more, simply read the other reviews. I do want to state that I appreciate the frank depiction and sensitivity that mental illness is portrayed in this film. It is not easy to watch the painful outbursts and anguish that the characters go through. Yet, the actors do such a brilliant and sensitive job with their roles that you are left with great insight into the mind and conflicts behind mania, manic depression, bipolar and emotional pain. Extraordinary. Jennifer Lawrence definitely earned her Oscar here. What a brilliant young actress I look forward to seeing more of in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CEX6MDTDJMM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A81MV3U#wasThisHelpful","R2CEX6MDTDJMM3","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This concert at Wembley Stadium is one of the best ever recorded of Queen by far. It has something for everyone. This features all of the hits and so much more. We have ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love,"" and other tunes that are actually really excellent covers of older songs by other artists.Freddy Mercury's amazing charisma, firecracker sense of humor and true atmosphere of confidence on that stage is mind blowing, as are the wonderful performances from his bandmates.

"In the last six months or so, I have gotten to be quite the Justin Timberlake convert. What was the impetus for this sudden interest in JT's music? I would say The Jimmy Fallon Show. His ""History of Rap"" videos with JF are nothing short of brilliant. When the dynamic duo are up singing and rapping a montage of hip hop snapshots, the impersonations are spot on and, in some cases, better than the originals. Be they The Beastie Boys, Macklemore or Jay Z. Also, the young man can dance. So, I had to check out the much talked about The 20/20 Experience and get a sense of that album's flavor.The album kicks off with ""Pusher Love"" and alludes to his lover's sexual and romantic prowess, drawing us in with mid-tempo rhythms and lyrics comparing her sweetness to various street drugs. It transitions to the intergalactic dance anthem ""Suit & Tie"" that has every element spelling out ""throwback."" Horn section and beats are flawless. I am not a Jay Z fan but I love JT on this one. His vocals are extremely sexy and infectious. ""Don't Hold The Wall"" works the hook to get us out on the floor dancing and making romance all along the way. ""Strawberry Bubblegum"" is full of innuendo and pseudo-innocence. Not at all saccharine once you understand the double entendre. ""Tunnel Vision"" is the scandalous single that was released with a video quickly censored by Youtube. ""Spaceship Coupe"" sounds like Justin Timberlake is channeling all of the soul greats and taking his lover on an interplanetary love ride. ""Let The Groove In"" gets my hips shaking and my shoulders rolling like a one-way ticket to Bahia, Brazil. There is definitely a Latin or dance hall feel to the percussion here, and the catchy hook. ""Mirrors"" is probably one of the most romantic love anthems of the summer. It truly describes JT's idea of a soul mate and his mirror image. What a more beautiful way to describe his love for wife Jessica Biel? ""Blue Ocean Floor"" takes us 20,000 leagues below the sea. We hear the air tank as part of the background instrumental and is a slow ballad to friendship and enduring, unconditional love.Justin Timberlake is probably one of the musical geniuses of our time. Though, his influences run far and wide when it comes to his inspiration for dance, music, acting and even comedy, his style is truly one of a kind. A great album. This young man just keeps getting more and more interesting with time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OYL7Z0DBADJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCZU8WM#wasThisHelpful","R3OYL7Z0DBADJP","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had heard about Bread & Chocolate for some years and was not even a glimmer in my mother's eye when it was originally released. It takes an honest, humorous and poignant look at the experience of Italian immigrants in Switzerland who came seeking work even in the face of discrimination and hardship. The main character (Nino Manfredi) is a waiter-in-training at a high class restaurant vying for the coveted job of waiter with his Turkish rival. Both Turks and Italians are horribly discriminated against in Switzerland. He must keep a stiff upper lip while he is missing his wife and children. Nino encounters Elena (Anna Karina), his beautiful and reclusive Greek neighbor with secrets of her own. He also must take life as it comes to him when he takes on work with an Italian compatriot he encounters at the restaurant and comes to find all is not what it seems about this man, even in the face of tremendous affluence and potential opportunity for Nino.The acting is superb, the comedy is fast and furious and the music is beautiful. In some ways, much of the state of Europe has remained the same even in the face of the European Euro. Discrimination and extremes in wealth and poverty are alive and well. This film beautifully examines these themes and more. I won't lie. It was not an easy film to watch. In some ways, it is gut wrenching. It seems the more the lead character tries to fit in and stay in Switzerland, in spite of nearly being deported a few times, the less he is able to assimilate in the culture he attempts to adopt. Intriguing look at the effect of immigration in the face of identity and human behavior.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y9AOGEXPPILV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005U1YR#wasThisHelpful","R2Y9AOGEXPPILV","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a long time Akira Kurosawa fan and was fascinated to see his beginnings in earlier works. One of his earliest films is The Most Beautiful. This film looks at the lives of the women in an optics factory - their heartbreaks, pressures, their agonies and the way that teamwork and team building are established through playing music together and playing volleyball games.This film felt more like a quasi-documentary than a drama. The actresses are so natural and the situations are so plausible. Example: Being asked to meet a higher production quota on account of the war and asking that the women generate at least 50% of the amount of optics material as the men. Woman worker says that women are capable of generating 2/3. The women are pushed to extremes of exhaustion and nervous breakdown. When one team player is forced to step away due to her health condition, this effects all women and they must tearfully accept their colleague's situation and absorb her work load for her.This film is beautiful to watch and it is also painful to watch. The women (and men) are like well oiled machines. They are trained to be an army of national solidarity in the factory, in addition to being production saavy. They are pushed emotionally, mentally, psychologically and physically to the breaking point. The women look almost ethereal. The actresses have a beautiful glow about them. A beautiful introduction to Kurosawa.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2922BT4JY30VD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002JC5XY#wasThisHelpful","R2922BT4JY30VD","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I happened upon this song quite spontaneously. I have gone on a huge Justin Timberlake kick in the last six months and decided to download an assortment of his songs to listen to his evolution as an artist. First of all, the content of this song is very deep. It takes on socially conscious subjects about the corruption of the world. The collaboration is between Justin Timberlake (on soaring vocals), will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas and the rapper Pharaohe Monch, hailing out of Jamaica, Queens. I had never heard of Monch before this song. It makes me want to explore his body of work as well.

"Oh Jason Mraz. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. You sparkle and glimmer while you remind us ""Life is Wonderful"" (Track One). Without much subtlety and plenty of bravado you take us on a journey through the ""Wordplay"" (Track Two) in your beautiful mind. You were never sexier than when you mixed your white and red laundry together and strutted down the road as a ""Geek in the Pink"" (Track Three). If I were your ex-lady I would definitely ""Get Your Message"" (Track Four) and give you a call. You can school me in the ways of love gone wrong or remain ""Mr. Curiosity"" (Track Five). Your words come so vividly and with such fervor that you have to remind me that life is about ""Clockwatching"" (Track Six). I would much rather take some time out and watch you sing to the ""Bella Luna"" (Track Seven) as you allude to it as a lover would. I would gladly hear about your ""Plane"" (Track Eight) adventure even as I miss you all the while. How beautiful to find a man with such regard for women or for love ""O. Lover"" (Track Nine). I promise to ""Please Don't Tell Her"" (Track Ten) that the feeling was mutual when she left your ass. ""The Forecast"" (Track Eleven) calls for a chance of sunshine and plenty of loving under the covers. Finally, your ""Song for a Friend"" (Track Twelve) inspires me to be a better friend to myself.The music here is memorable and the lyrics are rich with imagery and intelligence. Rare qualities not often found in today's music or when the album was first released eight years ago.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36JCQI89T3HUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009WJ3HU#wasThisHelpful","R36JCQI89T3HUX","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was my great pleasure to know Luc and the Lovingtons. They are a Seattle based band whose lead singer Luc Reynaud co-wrote one of the first tracks on this album covered by Mraz. ""Freedom Song"" sounds like sunshine set to melody. ""Livin' in the Moment,"" ""Woman I Love"" and the rest of the songs on this brilliant love letter to the world do not fail to disappoint.There is something of a ""throw back"" feel to this piece.

"I was a baby of the 1980s and miss that decade so much. Even though there were problems in the world (like there always are) it was, somehow, a less jaded and more jubilant world. Great films, like Stand and Deliver, remind me of this. This is based on the true story of teacher Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos), a man who gave up a steady job in a successful company, to teach math to a group of young people that the world had decided were rejects and unteachable - high school students of predominantly Mexican/Mexican American background. Escalante encounters rough around the edges teens like Angel Guzman (Lou Diamond Phillips), a young thug who is actually incredibly bright, but has not been given the structure or discipline to really apply himself. Escalante sees the challenges as an opportunity to encourage his students to empower themselves, and to also challenge the White majority and the school district, as well as Garfield High School, where they attend classes - a school that is about to lose its accreditation, and is scaring teachers away with its reputation and behavior problems.Some have called Stand and Deliver the Rocky of school underdog films. I would prefer to put it all in a class of its own. The story and script has moments of great humor, giving Edward James Olmos a chance to showcase his comedic prowess and timing, genuine depth and a great cast of fresh faced, young actors and actresses, many of whom I haven't seen in other films - with the exception of Lou Diamond Phillips, who went on to star in La Bamba and other movies - a heartthrob of the late 1980s and early 1990s. I wish there were more films of this calibre, today. These are truly hard to come by, as production values and intelligence have gone by the wayside, and CGI and scandal have become front and center, in addition to Facebook and Twitter followings. Great blast from the past.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TXB01Q3H04ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6305161917#wasThisHelpful","R3TXB01Q3H04ZD","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was like he was playing from the depth of his soul. So, this motivated me to purchase his first solo album, in the hopes of hearing more of his immense talent. I was really impressed with the first cut. After that, it was pretty much downhill. Bendito Entres Las Mujeres (Blessed Among Women) is a compilation of Vallan's collaborations with female vocalists (all in Spanish). Most of the singers are whiny, at best, and the guitar riffs get repetitive fast.

"As of late, I have been having some complexion issues. Due to blemishes, shifts in weather (a really dry month in Seattle), and hormones, I have frequent breakouts and scars from these episodes.

I was right in assuming this.This truly is a clear gel, that smells great (like fresh squeezed oranges). You apply and massage this to freshly moistened (with water) skin. You rub it in from 1-2 minutes, and then thoroughly rinse it off with water. My pores instantly felt cleansed and soothed. This is also supposed to minimize scarring - I haven't noticed a difference in this yet, but, I have only been applying it for about a week now. We shall see how things progress, in about a month's time. It always feels better, for me, to use products that do not add more garbage to my system - living in the big city and surrounded by poisons, anyway (pollution, etc). Another great product from NOW Foods, a company more people should really know more about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20Y22UFM99T0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UJCI8Y#wasThisHelpful","R20Y22UFM99T0L","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for a natural toothpaste that provides effective cleaning, in addition to freshening my breath. Since I have been pleased with Jason products, in the past, I decided to give this a whirl. The gel has a great tea tree, cinnamon and clove flavor - strong and you feel it killing halitosis in its tracks. The CoQ10 is supposed to help maintain healthy gums, and the fluoride is supposed to help with tartar, etc. Though, I have heard some negative comments about fluoride, my sense is that everything in moderation (no extreme amounts of anything in your system) is actually safe. My teeth and gums feel so clean and healthy after using this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJCIRO0RCK3AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001T8MTWO#wasThisHelpful","RJCIRO0RCK3AB","ADS5APY1NKTL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADS5APY1NKTL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried a lot of fish oil supplements in my life ever since I was a little kid (My mom is a big believer in omega 3 fatty acids for keeping you healthy) When I first starting living on my own I stopped but later I did notice a difference in my health when I started up again. Anyway I recently went on a mission to find the best fish oil supplement I could. So far these get my vote. My skin looks cleaner than ever, my joints feel great and as a added bonus I wasn't looking for - I've lost a little weight and gotten more cut. I look stronger and leaner without a shirt. This is something that has never happened before with any other fish oil. If your on the fence about getting these don't be. They really do live up to ""Platinum"" name. Oh I almost forgot... the company is very pro active, I received a email from the president asking about my experience with their product....they have my respect and continued business for that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMLZSGQHJUHAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDGJIAW#wasThisHelpful","RMLZSGQHJUHAX","A12N56U9AJDAZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12N56U9AJDAZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm glad I went with this griddle because of the large cooking area. That's the main reason I got it. I had one before, but I could cook only one thing at a time and that was just bogus. Thankfully this unit is big enough where I can take care of cooking for my whole family with one go. Talk about convenient. Another plus is the non stick surface/oil tray and how easy the whole thing is to clean. I just disconnect the heating mechanism and scrub it for a few minutes in the sink with soap and water. After that were good to go. The handle placement is pretty convenient too.

"This is by far the highest quality corkscrew I've had, and I've had quite a few since I feel wine is a important part of dining. Some things just taste better with it.The build is extremely solid on this corkscrew and it is amazingly easy to use.You just place it on top of the bottle, twist the handle until the sides come all the way up and the press down on the sides and the cork gets pulled into the center of the corkscrew mechanism. You give the handle a few more twists and that's it. You'll be ready to serve you and your guests a refreshing glass of wine. All other corkscrews I've owned required a certain amount of force to get the cork out but this one makes it effortless. I'm sure even a elderly lady with no upper body strength could remove the most stubborn cork with this device. Also the stopper is a nice touch, because before having one I didn't know what to do with the left over wine in a bottle, now I can just pop it on the bottle.

"If your having a tough time picking a weight loss supplement I'll make it simple for you pick this one...let me tell you why...I've tried many other weight loss supplements and they all work good in different ways.Of course I always do a lot of research before buying one and that is something I did with this one. I got it before it was number one on amazon so I didn't get drawn in by that. From the list of ingredients and from everything I had read online I felt I should try this supplement next.It's now been a month and this is what I can report from my own personal experience. It really is a great fat burner! (Maybe the best on the market today) and appetite suppressant.  After trying 15 other popular supplement in the past year I'm choosing to use w700 exclusively for the next year because I'm seeing results I haven't seen from any other supplements and I feel real good using it. Even though I'm eating less my energy level stays up and I don't experience any energy crashes during the day. It seems to elevate my mood... Probably because it kicks up my metabolism. Anyway this comes highly recommended. Give it a try I know you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MADA05C3Y0N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK61L3C#wasThisHelpful","R3MADA05C3Y0N4","A12N56U9AJDAZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12N56U9AJDAZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:10 Mins This bag gets five stars from me for several reasons...The first reason is that the material that it's made from seems high quality but at the same time it's light.I had a Duffel bag before that felt heavy without having anything in it. That is not the case with this bag and I like that..Who wants a bag that is unnecessarily heavy?Another reason I like this bag is the bit of cushion on the shoulder strap which is again something that every bag should have but doesn't always.Having this cushion prevents fatigue on your shoulder.Finally the ""shoe compartment"" is one my favorite features. When your in a rush you can easily get something specific from it without having to dig around in the bulk of the stuff in the bag.Overall this is a great little bag that I will be using quite a bit.It has room for storing everything you need on a quick trip and I do recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FJ0ACRY5DGXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZT3M2E#wasThisHelpful","R3FJ0ACRY5DGXL","A12N56U9AJDAZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12N56U9AJDAZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a long history with macbooks, their accessories and batteries since my first macbook which I got way back in fall of 2006.The design of macbooks has changed quite a bit over the years (They were all white back when I got my first one) but the technical structure and systems they employ has stayed relatively the same since then with the expectation of a few upgrades like the thunderbolt interface, etc.When I switched over to macbooks I was coming from a even longer history of Windows laptops (since the mid 90's) and things seemed a bit alien but over the years I gotten use to the way apple does things and have come to realize that their laptops are generally superior in design.Now with that being said letâs talk about the battery, which is something I've never been satisfied with in Macâs because I can only get a bit more than a hour when on my windows laptops I could get about 2 hours.  This is my personal experience I have no idea how long of a charge other people get on either system and OS.When I bought this battery it was because I needed a new one... my old one would no longer hold a charge and I wasn't looking for a battery that would last longer because I thought there wasn't one. Shockingly enough after installing and using this battery for a while Iâm consistently getting almost 4 hours with it. Thanks to that my macbook is now perfect...for me anyways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBLE61NZYDK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QBD99JS#wasThisHelpful","R2UBLE61NZYDK0","A12N56U9AJDAZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12N56U9AJDAZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Layered sophisticated plot and elegant writing keep the reader engaged and make the characters interesting and real. Wright's descriptions of people, places, and events are what one would expect to find in great literature. Others play secondary supporting roles, and there are just enough of them to muddy the waters of the investigation.

"Okay So far after testing this mp4 player for a almost a week and a few days, I have found it to be a pretty nice one for playing music through though just like the previous one that I had of this same type yet different color, I feel like this player should've been a lot more better as though the player is a little thin and made of not strong material, it still should have new features on it to make it different. Any way since this does exactly the same as my previous one(which was the blue 8GB & black 32GB one), I'm just going to put that right here as well:Firstly just like the way the player works, at the very top, there is a switch which you use to it turn OFF(on the left) or ON(on the right) though you can also turn it off or on by holding the middle button(which also acts as the play/pause button for the other features such as the video, music, and recording), but the switch has to be on the on side not the off one. As it comes on, you will see a welcome screen pop up but only for a second or two. next it instantly goes right to the menu which you then will see the icons: Music, Video, Record, FM Radio,Picture, System Settings, and Text. Also when you want to select the feature you want, you have to press the top panel which says menu on it and then you play whatever you want. The volume is located below it and when streaming music, just press that down panel button(which a volume control will then pop up), use the play previously & Next buttons to turn it down or turn it up, and press the menu button to go back in the feature you were in.The Music feature is pretty well made for playing a favorite tune while walking across the street or park. I mean the clarity to it is very spot on that you hardly can tell you're playing from a small device as this. I can store like almost all the songs I want on this player even if it kind of doesn't read my foreign artist's music titles that I listen to. The sound to it very awesome indeed with no distortions in it at all(and I convert my music from the high 320 to the 64 KBPS format too so that I can save space on my PC). I couldn't tell a difference at all between it being on my PC and this player. Now I didn't use the ear buds that came with them as they were just not fitted for me but I did use my headphones and they did awesomely well. Also if you press the menu button to the top, you will see four options which are: card folder, delete file, delete all, and exit(basically the editing menu for it) but when you are using the player and you press the menu button then, you will four different options:Repeat, Equalizer, Variable Speed Player, Replay Mode, and Exit(do note that if you don't select an option in a few seconds, it will go back to the player automatically(obviously that needs some improvement on). Just like I stated previously above, to play the player, you have to press the middle button and to go back a previous track/ rewind(holding down by the way), press the side button on the right while pressing the button on the left to skip a track/ forward(holding down).Now for the video, for me it does well but others who's expecting a  High Definition  resolution I suggest you look somewhere else as this one isn't the one for you. First of all before you can even start playing any on this video player and this is extremely important, you have to convert the video you want to the amv format(even though amv format is really mp4 but some reason when I try to play videos in that format, I get an format error which was weird) and find a good one because some of the ones that I had downloaded were not good at all but luckily I found one that does the trick in a jiffy. Any ways after converting to that format, plug the mini usb cable to the player and PC so that  you can transfer it over  to it. Once the menu icon on your PC/Laptop pops up, find the drive that says something of the line MICRO(I didn't like that name for mine so I changed it), and go into the folder that has a foreign font title and place the file there(don't mind the mp3 songs as this is what folder they are placed in also). Safely remove (or disconnect) the cable from the player & PC, and if it works you are golden but if it doesn't try another converter. For the screen display on it, since this is a very small player, you will be getting a small video along with being a little jazzed up while viewing(do note that it doesn't matter what high resolution you convert it from, it still is going to be the same so just a tip on that), but still viewable. Now the settings when pressed the menu when entering are kind of the same as the music but it has the repeat option to it and when you are playing the video, you can turn the volume up as you are seeing it and by holding the right  button on the side, you can rewind it back to a part that you liked to see and forward it if holding the left side button(you also can back a video or to a next one with these buttons as well when pressed). To me, it was good to me because I only use it to just relax and on my free time but i would really like to know how on earth do they get one of these amv movies very clear because I have like went through like 3 converters and I still get the same image quality which isn't very good. Also it seems that instead of having the same two tracks they put on the other two, this one had different ones which was like a folk tune and old classic back in the days. Unfortunately the Pictures in the Pictures Feature were the same no change though.As for the recording and the fm radio feature, I can't hardly say that much since I haven't really used it often but I had tried them both and they seem to do very well. The FM Radio works nice but just remember to hold it to try to find a good signal as for some areas it doesn't quite work well unless you do that so just a suggestion. The recording was pretty simple and when I tried for the first time, Instead of hearing myself talking, I am hearing kids talking which was just weird because when I was recording, there was no one around me and the kids were like in the other room playing with their toys. This tells me that it picks up voices close by pretty well.Now after all these features that I mentioned, you'd think that this is player doesn't has any big improvements to made be right but unfortunately it does. Since I'm getting a mp4 player with lots of storage, I kind of expect to at least see a new feature added to make it stand out from the 8 & 16 GB ones and probably enhance the model itself to make it look worth buying. The price for this mp4 definitely should be dropped down too as that is just too high for a player to do exactly as the  base model( the 8 &16GB one) with no changes whatsoever. The good news though is that I finally found the change the timing for it from going off to quickOverall, I think that player is a pretty nice one for having to listen through though it definitely needs some more improvements on the features and the design itself because it basically just looks like a base model with a 32GB Micro SD Card inserted into it to me.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FV1O0EVLHN8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Z9T3RY#wasThisHelpful","R3FV1O0EVLHN8B","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well since I haven't really had this repellent for that long(only had it in my outlet for like a week), I can't really tell a difference in it repelling insects(or my case the flies) as they still are flying in my kitchen, but i did notice that after like 3-5 days, instead of hearing the little squeaky mouse that comes out of the wall on the side of my kitchen all the time(even when I blocked it with a board, it always seems to get out by chewing through), I didn't really hear any scratching at the wall this time so I guess this repellent does work for that somewhat, but I guess it's going to take a little more time before it can get rid of the flies in my kitchen like the previous one I bought(which also repelled even flies(along with rodents) better than this one after a few days), but after having for three months, has given out. Also I forgot to mention that there is no instructions to it either as the only thing you do is plug it in an outlet and it supposedly should begin working as the light in front of it turns dark blue(and the sound it uses to repel is silent as the wind since you can't really hear it at all unless you're an rodent). Overall, I think this repellent is best for rodents in walls than for flies in your home, but this is just my experience so many might have different than I have as not everyone's houses are the same.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TBPABJ1DT9JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HROTYE#wasThisHelpful","R1TBPABJ1DT9JZ","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using these two baking mats for these few days in my kitchen, and they have really been helping me out a lot. Since their mats, they fit in a oven pretty well with no problems and they also work nicely for being nonstick too which I have baked some of my favorite deserts on 3-5 times, and seen no issues arising(though I did notice that after each use, the place where the previous pieces were had left an spot imprint inside but after like buying others similar of this kind, I think this is to be expected of all of them since it did the same with them too),but I will tell you what I found pretty intriguing that the other mats I own don't have compared to this. It seems that you can put these in the microwave which kind of really of cool and puzzles me because if I try to place this in mine, it takes up the whole room in it, but after heating one of my cooked cookies(I had made the other night) on it for a few seconds, surprisingly it worked(and thank god it didn't catch on fire), but just remember I only tried this only one time and the second were very short.As for using in the oven, well instead of like many of placing this on a baking pan before putting inside, my family and I place the baking mat inside by itself and when it's finish cooking, I then carefully slide it on a baking pan, and enjoy what's on it which majority be chocolate chip turtle cookies & frozen foods like chicken fries & Corn dogs. The best two parts that I like about these(and all others) mats is that when the pastry or frozen food is finished cooking, they don't stick to it like they do in baking pans and also when you're finished with them for the day, you hand wash them off and they return almost back to new which really makes having Baking in General worthwhile. I definitely will recommend to anyone who wants a pair of mats that are good at baking their deserts on(but not things like brownies because it can get really messy really quick if you do) for their family.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG0LAMOIEQCPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010VBHS98#wasThisHelpful","RG0LAMOIEQCPH","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay so I got this flash-drive for my mom since she wanted to install the newest windows 10 on her all in one Hp PC but in order to do that, she had to make a recovery disc just in case in any thing went wrong. Well after plugging this drive in the back of the drive and opening the file in the removable disc it was located at, I notice that at first when I looked at all my drives in view mode with the others were,the size that was available on this stick was 29.1 GB which was weird because it was supposed to be 32GB and also there were no files on it at all, but after opening the properties folder of it, I found that it was 32GB but the file space part just said at as a ratio thing. Any way, after backing the recovery files up on this flash-drive(which by the way took almost half that of it), then installed the windows 10 onto the PC which went smoothly. Overall, I am satisfied with stick as it has plenty of storage for almost anything you want to place on it and if that wasn't enough, it seems it also has a nice labeler slide card you can put on it in case you like forget what's on it which was definitely a nice touch to it.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CN5AF4XM5WW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWEBO3I#wasThisHelpful","R2CN5AF4XM5WW8","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay so like a few days ago, I had received this coconut oil on my doorstep, and have been trying it ever since. Let me just say it has been the best one I've had so far. Never have I had such an oil that smells like it was fresh cut from the trees from a far away island and not to mention the size to it as well. Man, this thing is HUGE(About 1.5 liters a matter of fact). It probably going to last for a really long time depending on how & where you use it at. The ways I've been using it have been in my hair, on my body, in the kitchen, and the results have been fabulous.When I put it in my hair(Liquid Form), I noticed that it kind of like gave my hair a little treatment from being tangled as I used it also with my detangling comb along with providing my scalp with a lovely scented shine of the taste of freshly cut coconuts which was just divine. After doing that for a couple days, I then started to apply a piece(I even applied some when it was turned to liquid(which by the way happens pretty fast if you're home's humidity is a little over the average temperature) on my body and hands after stepping out of the shower, and with it just easily sliding over my body, I could feel it absorbing at a very quick rate, but that's not all. I even put some on the bottom of my feet to keep them moisture and also to prevent them from being dry which by the way does a very good job at too. As for in the kitchen, well for that, I let the oil turn into liquid for awhile and then poured about a 1/4 cup in a frying pan to use for making my cheese eggs that I make everything morning but this time without the butter. When it was finally done and i took a bite of it, I noticed that the eggs had a different taste to it than it used to be as it was very flavory  diversal which was just lovely as I am a person who loves diversity in her food and so do my kids as well. I mean who knew that an oil such as this could do all this, and it is naturally healthy so you don't have to worry about any toxins or fatty acids being hidden in your food while you and your family chow to a meal because there is none. I definitely think this oil is the real deal as it says REAL coconut all over from the fresh imported coconut scent to the texture(which is pretty smooth when liquified) of how it feels on you. Definitely will recommend.Note:""I was sent a sample in Exchange for My Honest Opinion""","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZK7P49R83U1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8HZS1W#wasThisHelpful","RZK7P49R83U1H","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just a few days ago, I had received the replacement for this mp4 player as the first one I had was defected, well since it's like the same as the blue one that I own, I'm just going to post the same thing, but with a little changes since some of the stuff included were a little different from the previous one so here goes:""A few days has went by as I've been using this mp4 player and I definitely can see a few enhancements to it compared the previous 16 GB model of this brand. It seems that they even re-modified the whole thing to give it a refreshing new look along with adding in an extra micro SD slot that I think you can use to double the storage on it but not entirely sure though. Now for the features, there wasn't hardly any change to them but a few which I will try to a little more.When you want to turn this mp4 player on, just like the previous model, you just slide the switch to on but it seems as though that input has been moved from the left to the right and the ON function switch is on the right not the left along with the slider and even the front part being a very intriguing black color to give it a nice look to see. Now when you turn it on through the switch, you now get a very beautiful loading screen that after a few seconds shows your feature icons, but not in a menu way though. Now the feature's icons have been enhanced with beautiful unique colors that kinds makes it look stunning. For Instance, the game icon now has a picture showing a game of cards(though that type isn't on this device), and it's very colorful too. The buttons still kind of work the same way as the previous one(such as the menu button as the top is the selector for going into a feature, the previous a track/ rewind a song/move left(when playing games) is still on the left and the next(skip a) track/ forward a song/ move right is on the right side) but instead of the play/pause/record button being at the bottom, it is now positioned in the middle along with the volume button being at the bottom.The Music Feature is pretty much the same as the previous one with it playing very nicely along hearing it perfectly with no distortions in the sounds. I also noticed that I can play my music in wma format as well after trying that out the other day, and that if you like to listen foreign music like I do, you now can see the symbols for the track popping up when it's playing which is pretty cool to me because usually I would have to set it to that appropriate language to see them but now it like almost detects  it and apply it with the song track(which by the way, I have this language still set in English) which makes that pretty interesting and awesome in my book. Now do note that I only tried just a few different language songs as that is all I listen to so I don't know if it will do the same for the other ones. It also seems that there was a  little change with the two tracks that came with it this time as on this one, you can't really tell what artist is playing.The Video Feature(now with a movie film icon) just like the previous one works just about the same with it being pretty decent in seeing the videos nicely but do note that it is still a small screen so don't expect much. The volume level with the video is pretty stable as I can hear pretty well what is being said. Just Remember to Convert the file to amv format as that is the only way to fully play them without getting an error. The weirdest thing I found about this part though was that every time I try to convert a file to the preferred type, It always be in a average video screen view which I thought was to happen like that but on this player's feature instead of having a video of a funny short clip, this one had a video of a woman artist dancing and singing along with being in crystal clear quality which astounded me because let me just say that I have severely been trying to get a video in that quality(trying like 2-3 converters) for almost like a few days now and I still end up with the average one which is barely viewable so I would really like to know how they did it.The Recording Feature(now with a mic icon) is very good at doing its job as it recorded my language session that I was writing the other day. Just press the now new positioned play button in the middle a few times, and it starts recording. I also noticed that instead of the small mic being at the bottom, it is now at the top. When you are finished recording, hold the menu button to save it and go back into the front menu where the other features are. If you want to hear the things you recorded, when in the Menu Feature Selection part, just go over to the next feature which is referred to as Voice(has a  loud phone icon), select it, and there you will see the recording you've done in 32kps WAV format. If you hit the menu button, you will have a few options that you can use to either delete a single recording and redo another one in the recording feature, or if you recorded a lot, in this voice feature menu, you can select to delete them all to save memory.The FM Feature(now with a Radio Icon) is really good like the previous model. Actually after buying  these, I'm really impressed that this feature works as good as it does and it detects the stations around my home in like seconds. Just select the previous track(etc.) button to go back a station and  the next track(etc.) to go up one but if you want to go in a fast searching mood, just hold down one of those buttons that I mentioned above and when you get close to the FM station you are looking for, just press the menu button and it stop at the station it's on. Now the Setting Feature(has a gear icon) though which kind of does nothing but change how things are is what really did change a little. Just like the previous  model, it has the change language, clock, firm upgrade, online, etc settings, but also with a setting that can change the way the LCD Dark Screen looks which is pretty nice. I also just a few days ago found where to change the timing for the turn off part along with a section that you use to put it to sleep but I didn't fully test that part though. The Game Feature is pretty nice though it would be even better if they had added more than just one game(even if it is a pretty good one to pass the time).The Photo Feature(Photo Icon) is pretty good as the pictures that I have put on(though in small size though) look very nice. Even the two pics that it came with it is very different as instead of having of buildings, this one had one of a island beach and the other of a bird on a tree. Now on the E-book feature(Three Book Icon), it seems this didn't really include any books this time but that's alright because I'm not a person who finds this kind of thing interesting.For the issues that I have found for it, well it seems that it hardly seems there are none. Well in my book I haven't fully seen yet but I can definitely say the battery life(compared to the first one) is wonderful as I can listen to like 2-14 songs and it still have almost a full amount of energy left(about 75-83% if I'm guessing right) which is superb if you ask me.Overall, to me, I found this mp4 player to be quite superb than the previous 16GB model that I have and the battery length last quite awhile which I love a lot. Right now I've been using it to listen to my favorite songs while I'm taking a 2 mile walk from my house. Now if you are one of those people who want a high quality mp4 player or thinks that the sound has to be hi-def, then I would advise you look somewhere else as the only sound this player has is that of standard music player so for the ones that want a player that is very lightweight, portable in the pocket, and plays normally then I would recommend this to you.""Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X7TZL2GBRI93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQODKHU#wasThisHelpful","R2X7TZL2GBRI93","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gotta say that I'm loving this car trunk organizer pretty much than I thought I would. Now I've had a few car trunk like this one but it seems this one definitely deserves the award for the best one I've had yet. It comes in a nice black color that isn't fully dark nor light, and at one shorter end, it has a wide pocket with flap while the other end has 2 pockets with flaps. Each side has 2 mesh storage pockets along with one that is stitched to put smaller items in. The pockets even are decorated with an orange strip across the top of them to make it look very cute & chic.

"After using this for almost a week straightening out my hair, I gotta say that I'm loving this flat iron a lot. It is pretty awesome!!  This flat iron is just the right size to hold in your hand along with being easy to maneuver as well. The color it came in too is very stylish as it resembles that of one of my black and red party gown that I like to wear with the outer part being black while the heating pads(where the clamps are) having a satin red type of color to make it blend pretty well with my other hair products.Now unlike the other flat Irons that I've had, that has like different settings(high, low, or medium) for you to decide how hot you want them, this ceramic flat iron works by you just plugging the cord into the outlet and turning it on which it immediately starts heating up too to a certain degree. There is like a switch which you use to turn it on(which a red light will be lit to indicate its on) or off, and this next part is what I kind of found pretty interesting. You see once you turn the flat iron on and apply it to one of your hair strands, the temperature of the heat automatically adjusts to your hair type(Pretty Neat Right?). I mean you really don't find that many flat irons that does this. Just the other day, I was using this flat iron to straighten out my frizzy hair, and it did pretty well along with providing the sufficient heat to help keep it down that way. I've even flipped my hair with it too.Overall, I found  this flat iron to be quite a good one for providing a nice style to any type of hair along with providing the enough heat to fully keep it down so I will recommend this to my family and friends though I've already let my mom use it and she seems to really love it especially the automatic heat temperature adjusting part.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12SQ7OV09ILAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OSCQC3K#wasThisHelpful","R12SQ7OV09ILAE","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For almost over two weeks, I have had this speaker playing in my house, and let me just say this is a good one indeed. The way it feels tells me that it was crafted by an awesome engineer along with having a solid design too. When you look at it from front to back, you'd think that this device has like six speakers but really it has three(built in) to make it look almost like a sound bar, and it seems that's not all this baby can do as it has many other features than just playing music which is having a nice stable radio mode. So far these are the features I've tried out and I gotta say they are pretty stable and efficient too.First of all, the way this speaker bar works is by turning the switch on the left side from off to on and it then will speak a nice tone informing you that it's either on or trying to pair with your device. Once it's fully paired(which it also inform as well), you then can decide what feature you want to be in by using the control buttons to the top. Now what I noticed about this device's controls was that they were on a whole complete level from just pressing them on a usual Bluetooth speaker instead this one had the futuristic touch  control one which was really amazing because of all the speakers I've had, none have actually had a control feature as this one and I found that to be really awesome. Instead of me just pressing the buttons, I now can just tap the button icon on the display which definitely was pretty fun. For instance, If I wanted to skip a track on my device, I just tap the two arrow icon facing right and it will go to the next song, but if I wanted to turn the volume up a little, I just hold it instead(same goes for going back to a previous track icon and the play/ pause icon, but for the icon with the m on it, that one works a little differently as you have to tap it  if you wanted to get into the radio feature mode.)As for sound to this speaker, boy let me tell you this is device is pretty loud. If you ask me it probably would fit pretty well in the loud and bumping sound category speakers along with having a superb sound of clarity and no distortions whatsover. If you like hold it in your hands(as it is kind of palm sized) while the music is playing, you can actually feel the sound waves(or vibes) passing through which was pretty cool. Also if you plug a aux cord from it to into one of your ports on your device, it will then turn off Bluetooth mode and go into what is call AUX mode which instead of playing your music through your device's speakers, it now will play through the speaker, and I almost forgot to mention that the volume level is very good with or without the cord as well.Now we go into the radio feature which I personally think it does amazingly well. Just like I mentioned above, to go to this mode, you first have to tap the m icon button for a few seconds until you hear the voice saying FM radio mode. Now just like the button icons you use to skip and rewind, you use the controls for this feature the same to go back a station or to another one but for the play/pause icon one,you tap to actually pause (YEAH You can pause a radio station) it, and you hold so that the device can detect the stations around your area(which I would like to add that it picks up pretty quickly). The signal to each one is very great by the way and I only had to like move this device around for only one station since I was positioned in a no station area inside my home but once I moved from that area, it started clearing up(do note I do know that I can use the mini usb cable but I decided not to though).Now If you're wondering if I noticed any problems with this speaker, I would loved to say I didn't but alas there was. It seems that when I have this speaker connected to my PC and I move a little from it, the sound starts getting distorted a little and if going a little further(lets say from my living room to up stairs), it disconnects completely but reconnects when back downstairs. Now I know that for many that this isn't something that would faze them that much, but for me since I like my devices to have plenty of distance from my devices, I find that to be quite a problem. But other than that, everything else(well the features I tested) seemed pretty fine.Overall, I really did find this Bluetooth speaker/radio pretty cool but  it would be really awesome if they would improve that ranging length so that I can enjoy my music freely like the radio feature mode. Do note that I know that there are other features on this speaker but these two were the main one I used daily though. Also now get this and I mean this was pretty unique when I saw it for myself. Anyway so just a few minutes when I had this speaker in FM Radio mode and one of the stations was full of static, so to fix this problem just as I was about to move it to a place to get a better signal and pick it up, it weirdly started getting a little better when my hand was over it. Now when I moved my hand from over it, it went back to being static. It was almost like it was picking up my static to give it better reception.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UF9IJ1TOHZB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1N7W0E#wasThisHelpful","R2UF9IJ1TOHZB8","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using this seasoning in my food these past days, I definitely gotta say that it really tastes good when added to one your family meals. I mean when I tried it with my homemade hamburgers, it tasted like a flavorful steak burger but hinting with other ingredients that be in seasonings. It also changed the color of the way it normally is though I did add cheese to them so I'm not fully sure but I do know that if you sniff it to your nose, the scent of steak along with having a strong aroma of black pepper added to it definitely can be smell very well. I each let my children taste the burgers with this steak seasoning, and they all agreed that it was really good.  I liked it as I'm a person who loves to have flavor in her meals so I will recommend to others if you want an added flavor in your favorite dish.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HHMBA41OCRUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3S9MOY#wasThisHelpful","R1HHMBA41OCRUL","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Using this charger has been pretty good as it charged my devices up each time I plugged the usb port piece into them. When I look as it from a good distance, all I can say that  it just screams Foreign as from the way it was sturdily designed to the box having foreign characters all over it along with English but that much though. When I like grasp it in my hands, I can fully tell that it was built pretty well as there is like a smooth sturdy outer material around it along with having a bright but low orange color at the top where the buttons are fully located, and I also had found a little weird was that though this is supposed to be a 8,000 mAh power bank, all over the box it was enclosed in says it's a 10,400 mAh which I think it is because of all the charging it did to my devices and phone.The way this power bank does  kind of  function a little differently than my previously ones too as instead of detecting a device, you have to press the power button after plugging the usb port in your device(which you also can use to tell how much power is left when having no devices plugged in too as in the front of it is four lights to indicate the juice left before charging the charger itself) to the output port(Which by the way only has just one but the good news is that the Output charge is 5V 2.1A). Now there hasn't been any shortages of using this charger these past days along with not heating up when providing juice to my electronics and phone. For the first few days, I first charged my IPhone 5c up and it did well providing a proficient charge to it along with being a tad bit faster than my wall charger and still having like 2-3 lights lit up so the other night I plugged my phone to it again as I went to sleep and when I woke up, the phone was completely charged again but this time I had only(or barely) 2 lights lit up this time so I had to charge it back up fully before using again. After letting this charger fully charge up, I then plugged up my other devices(which were SOUNDPEATS Bluetooth Headphones(wasn't fully dead but halfway though), rechargeable Vibration Massager(completely dead), and my blue lipstick-size power bank(probably about 20-36% still left to it)) to it, and it fully charged them up along with still having two-three fully lit lights left which was pretty impressive if you ask me.Overall, I found this charger to be pretty helpful as it charges pretty efficiently and since it's not that big, I can take it with me easily in my hood pocket or handbag when I'm on the go. Yet like I said at the beginning, I really think that this charger's compacity has 10,400 mAh than the one on the label and site so I definitely would change that as that can get others a little confused on the compacity level. So far, I haven't really found any defects  but I do will update. Otherwise I think it's a good charger so far.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWZ378GOFYPAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTTNEFS#wasThisHelpful","RWZ378GOFYPAH","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been baking my favorite desserts on this pastry/ baking mat for these past days, and I gotta say that I love it. The  very nice crafted designs around the edges is a beautiful sight to be seen along with having instructions on making pastries, bread, and even small size little home made pizzas(do note this does take a lot of effort in doing still even when using the circle measurements on it) in an accurate(or equivalent) batch each time which is pretty neat especially the Measure Conversions part. It even has a cm. & in ruler to help cut the pieces of dough any way you want.Now I will tell you what really struck me by surprise though. After putting my bread rolls on this mat, I noticed that(when I stuck my head in the oven to place them in a neat row) the size of it is very HUGE that the whole thing could hardly fit in my electric oven which I had to arrange it so that it would set in right. I was also going to place a few buns in a vertical line as I thought that the wideness wouldn't be enough to fully keep them on the mat, but it seems that I didn't have to worry about that as the width of it is very LONG too(as a matter of fact, it's almost longer than the width of the oven rail) which made it very simple to put them that way. If I could fully take a good guess on how many pastries or dough that this mat can hold, I would say between 15-20 (depending on the size  and how they are placed by the way) which to me is a lot.Though it is made of fiber glass, it kind of don't feel like it as the top feels more smooth-like, and it can roll up just fine along with hand wash with ease but do note that if you like burn something on it such as a bread(or even corn dog), there is going to be like a stain(or print) that showed that something was right there so if you are worried about trying to get it out, don't bother because it's embedded into it as this usually happens with all the mats of this type, but this didn't happen until I used it the third time this week.Overall, I enjoyed this mat as it really has helped me work more better with my baking by making my dough portions for my bread and pizza crust be in an accurate measurement and it's very smoothly huge too so I definitely would recommend this if you want a good nonstick pastry mat that holds a lot of dough and can make them come out right almost each time. Do note that I also did see if this mat was good at being nonstick and it definitely does somewhat but I would use it only by itself for stuff like corn dogs or bread rolls and use a pan for stuff like brownies and tarts.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HJWOKZHLHECO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XAK5SU#wasThisHelpful","R2HJWOKZHLHECO","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Using this facial body brush these past days has been a enjoyment to my face to remember. I haven't felt my face this clean in quite a while now. There are  different types of brushes(facial, Exfoliating, Body, and Pumice) that can easily come on or off and help enhance the texture of your skin with each one of them performing almost entirely in their own unique way while the speed to it operates at just one speed, it still does mediumly well at making the face shine.The first one I started using was the pumice stone and let me just tell you this, the texture and feel it gave to my face was absolutely outstanding. I mean I know that I clean my face each day but when I had finished and looked at the the head, I noticed that the stone went from white to almost black(which indicates the trapped dirt left in the skin by the way) in like a few minutes(as it don't really take that long to use this brush on your face). I was like surprised at how much dirt was left in the pores of my skin because I always make sure my face is clean even at night along with using beauty cleansing products to help with that even further so this definitely was a big shocker to know that I didn't fully whole cleanse my face as I thought I did. Also it seems that you hardly won't get that much use out it too as after a few uses, it's time to get a replacement for that brush head which I think I'm going to need one very soon as it's starting to get blacker every time I use it, and you also can use this to sharpen your nails too but don't do it firmly as that can mess with the motor in the brush(even scar you too) but that's just my suggestion though.Next one was the Body brush. Now this one is take a while to get used to since I'm not fully used to using a body brush that spins but once I got the hang of it in like a few minutes, everything else was a piece of cake though it would've been even better if this brush came with a cream to apply on the body. I used my body butter with it to moisturize my body after stepping out of the tub and it did pretty well though the spinning was kind of going all over the place so make sure hold it a little firmly(not TOO firm) by the grip handle for you to control it right. After finishing up polishing my skin with this brush head, I notice that it moisturized the butter into my skin very well along with giving me a nice glow as well.The Facial Cleansing brush also does a good work at helping cleanse the skin which I have done plenty of times since using it. The bristles to this one is oh so  soft to the touch and when you are cleansing your face, you can actually feel it rejuvenating your skin back to its natural state. I used my glycerin soap that I use everyday with this brush, and it definitely cleanses well into the skin but as I had stated above, it really would've been better if there was a cream or something with this set. Also do remember to wash the head first before using so that the cream or soap you are using can cling to the bristles a little more easily.Finally after washing the my face from the soap suds on my face, I move on down to the last brush head  which is the exfoliating brush. All I can really say about this one is that it does pretty good at getting into the pores of my skin as the bristle texture is soft and has a slight different from Cleansing one, but it still kind of feel like the facial brush head a little bit and without having an improper cream to go with it, I can't fully really compare them to see  what differences have been made other than the bristle.Overall, I found this 4 detachable piece brush set to be pretty good at doing what needs to do such as cleansing out the pores in the facial skin, moisturizing the body, but I feel as though if there was like some kind of cream(or even a sample) added to it, it would've been a little better. Hopefully they will put that in next time.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1JNVAQK6GZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWBRF7U#wasThisHelpful","RK1JNVAQK6GZ3","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wearing these compression leg socks these past days have been very wonderful as they feel very weightless when having them on. The time to fully get them on does kind of take a while to get on as first(since they compress and expand a little(depending on the size which I got was a Large and my foot size is an 11), the tightness happens instantly when trying to  put them on so just a heads up on that you are going find a routinely way to fully get it on without fully stretching it too much like I did by rolling and holding the top part while I put my foot in and keep pulling the bottom part where the foot is so that it can fully get on) but when you get the hang of it, it's going to be worth it.The part where the foot is, really does give your feet a nice sock-less feel to it along with having a very nice light navy blue comfort padded strip around all the way to where the ankle is which I think is for having to keep you from fully slipping and falling on your butt.  Once the sock is on, the compression kinds of like lock in the stretchness for your foot to fully move about and not hardly feel you even have them on too which is very nice.Now the part where the leg part is where I noticed a pretty good difference in my walks that I like to take on my day-off. Just like the part where the the foot part has, there is a very nice line light navy striped to it but this time, it's positioned like to the top which by the way it fullys covers the leg fully(this sleeve sock goes all the way to the kneed which is pretty long if you ask me) along with giving the leg the appropriate compression you would need to fully move in. As I was taking my walk just a few days ago, I noticed that I usually would feel worn out after like doing 5-12 laps around a 6mile long park ring but I wasn't. I actually did like a few more(2-3) before(though not my legs) I ran out of water in my bottle I like to carry with me. That to me was interesting since I never walked that many times before(which usually it would be 5-7 before I sit down and rest) along with running out of water too(I think I better carry more next time). For some reason, as i was walking with these sleeves on, I felt that I just wanted to keep walking without stopping which was just weird because I really don't walk that long so that definitely was a change if you ask me and this also tells me that these sleeve socks really does keep you going too.Overall, these sleeves socks definitely does give you an extra boost in your exercise routines(such as jogging, walking, running, etc) along with being nicely designed too, but I tell you one thing that these socks do have also, and that is the presence of not having them on at all. On the next day of wearing these socks again and from doing my everyday tasks that I went to sleep early for some reason(and that even includes removing things I don't need when sleeping), and after waking up the next morning, I looked down surprised to see that the sleeves socks were still on my feet.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DIV3QND60HMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NJIT5K#wasThisHelpful","R3DIV3QND60HMW","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Using this mp4 player to like play my tunes & look at music videos has been great and all, but I really thought that I was going to see some enhancements or improvements from the last one I had bought. It seems the only thing that's different is that it can now hold a lot more storage(32GB) than the other one(which was previously 8 GB). Even the design to it is the same. Any way since this does exactly the same as my previous one(which was the blue 8GB one), I'm just going to put that right here as well:Firstly the way this player works is that at the very top, there is a switch which you  use to it turn OFF(on the left) or ON(on the right) though you can also turn it off or on by holding the middle button(which also acts as the play/pause button for the other features such as the video, music, and recording), but the switch has to be on the on side not the off one. As it comes on, you will see a welcome screen pop up but only for a second or two. next it instantly goes right to the menu which you then will see the icons: Music, Video, Record, FM Radio,Picture, System Settings, and Text. Also when you want to select the feature you want, you have to press the top panel which says menu on it and then you play whatever you want. The volume is located below it and when streaming music, just press that down panel button(which a volume control will then pop up), use the play previously & Next buttons to turn it down or turn it up, and press the menu button to go back in the feature you were in.The Music feature is pretty well made for playing a favorite tune while walking across the street or park. I mean the clarity to it is very spot on that you hardly can tell you're playing from a small device as this. I can store like almost all the songs I want on this player even if it kind of doesn't read my foreign artist's music titles that I listen to. The sound to it very awesome indeed with no distortions in it at all(and I convert my music from the high 320 to the 64 KBPS format too so that I can save space on my PC). I couldn't tell a difference at all between it being on my PC and this player. Now I didn't use the ear buds that came with them as they were just not fitted for me but I did use my headphones and they did awesomely well. Also if you press the menu button to the top, you will see four options which are: card folder, delete file, delete all, and exit(basically the editing menu for it) but when you are using the player and you press the menu button then, you will four different options:Repeat, Equalizer, Variable Speed Player, Replay Mode, and Exit(do note that if you don't select an option in a few seconds, it will go back to the player automatically(obviously that needs some improvement on). Just like I stated previously above, to play the player, you have to press the middle button and to go back a previous track/ rewind(holding down by the way), press the side button on the right while pressing the button on the left to skip a track/ forward(holding down).Now for the video, for me it does well but others who's expecting a  High Definition  resolution I suggest you look somewhere else as this one isn't the one for you. First of all before you can even start playing any on this video player and this is extremely important, you have to convert the video you want to the amv format(even though amv format is really mp4 but some reason when I try to play videos in that format, I get an format error which was weird) and find a good one because some of the ones that I had downloaded were not good at all but luckily I found one that does the trick in a jiffy. Any ways after converting to that format, plug the mini usb cable to the player and PC so that  you can transfer it over  to it. Once the menu icon on your PC/Laptop pops up, find the drive that says something of the line MICRO(I didn't like that name for mine so I changed it), and go into the folder that has a foreign font title and place the file there(don't mind the mp3 songs as this is what folder they are placed in also). Safely remove (or disconnect) the cable from the player & PC, and if it works you are golden but if it doesn't try another converter. For the screen display on it, since this is a very small player, you will be getting a small video along with being a little jazzed up while viewing(do note that it doesn't matter what high resolution you convert it from, it still is going to be the same so just a tip on that), but still viewable. Now the settings when pressed the menu when entering are kind of the same as the music but it has the repeat option to it and when you are playing the video, you can turn the volume up as you are seeing it and by holding the right  button on the side, you can rewind it back to a part that you liked to see and forward it if holding the left side button(you also can back a video or to a next one with these buttons as well when pressed). To me, it was good to me because I only use it to just relax and on my free time.As for the recording and the fm radio feature, I can't hardly say that much since I haven't really used it often but I had tried them both and they seem to do very well. The FM Radio works nice but just remember to hold it to try to find a good signal as for some areas it doesn't quite work well unless you do that so just a suggestion. The recording was pretty simple and when I tried for the first time, Instead of hearing myself talking, I am hearing kids talking which was just weird because when I was recording, there was no one around me and the kids were like in the other room playing with their toys. This tells me that it picks up voices close by pretty well.Now after all these features that I mentioned, you'd think that this is player doesn't has any big improvements to made be right but unfortunately it does. Since I'm getting a mp4 player with lots of storage, I kind of expect to at least see a new feature added to make it stand out from the 8 GB ones and probably enhance the model itself to make it look worth buying. The price for this mp4 definitely should be dropped down too as that is just too high for a player to do exactly as the  base model( the 8GB one) with no changes whatsoever and also I really think that the go off for a few seconds without use function is just not a good function(even though it says it happens in the manual) as that can mess up someone's flow when they are in the melody mood. If they probably could extend that to a minute, that will help a lot.Overall, I think that player definitely needs some more improvements on the features and the design itself because it basically just looks like a base model with a 32GB Micro SD Card inserted into it.Note:âI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.â","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JW7H5KI0E1SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Z9PZJE#wasThisHelpful","R3JW7H5KI0E1SQ","ABYN52L82K14R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABYN52L82K14R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For two whole weeks, I have been applying this Super toner on the face, and it has given my face a nice feeling to it. The toner kind of smells like that of alcohol or witch hazel water, but when I apply it to my face, I notice that after like a few seconds(or a minute), it absorbs into the skin along with providing a radiant glow as well. I even let my brother try it for this face to see if it would help with the shave marks, and he said after putting some on his face and waiting for a few minutes, his beard hair didn't feel itchy. Now we both haven't really been seeing any big results(just like him, I also has marks but instead of from shaving, they are from acne) being cleared up yet but we did see that some of the little spots were starting to clear up(do note they were not huge big spots but almost look like mini bumps). We still are using it right now as our faces both need cleansing and seeing that this toner did just a little improvement is proof to us that it works but is going to take a little more time before we can fully see clear face.

"I find myself trembling penning this review, surprised at my own audacity in delivering a critique so soon after our beloved Claudio Abbado passed away. Music lovers universally have mourned the loss of one of our greatest conductors. Despite Abbado's success in Mahler, he seems less suited to Bruckner, despite a generous assortment of discs on DG with the Vienna Phil. Abbado seemed unlikely to gain intensity last minute, given his fragile health, so I didn't expect this Bruckner 9th to truly compete with the best. Nonetheless, I'm too devoted a fan not to give it a listen.Abbado seems calm and controlled in the opening. He gets a full sound from Lucerne, caught in great sound by DG. Heading into the lyrical second theme, he is fairly subdued and straightforward. This music sounded more passionate under Sir Simon Rattle on his recent recording with the Berlin Phil, and of course Karajan is the perfect exemplar of fire and intensity. Here the strings don't have a real full presence; there's not the sonority in full volume found in the best rival European orchestras. I'd appreciate more impact in the climaxes. But the lyrical passages aren't much better. Abbado has a rare gift of sensitivity that enables him to bring out detail with touching sincerityâI wish I heard that in evidence here. As it is, this first movement sounds like a highly accomplished run-through. The main thing missing is mystery. Abbado is capable of maintaining the line and flow, but he doesn't seem to be searching for anything; at its best, this music is unsettling. The problem isn't so much that he holds back the power in the climaxes as it is that he doesn't find a captivating pulse. It feels smooth, well considered, yes, but not emotionally involving. There's not the rapport between Abbado and the musicians that is indicative of him at his best.Tbe 2nd movement is hard to do wrong, and Abbado certainly delivers a rousing performance, if nothing outstanding. It's in a sunny, more sprightly vein than most readings. He's best at the lighthearted interludes, where he pulls off graceful charm quite convincingly, with merrily chirping woodwinds. His phrasing is more varied and interesting than in the 1st movement. There's an absence of terror, which some listeners will find egregious, but on its own terms, this movement is enjoyable.It would seem perfect for Abbado to end his brilliant career with a wrenching, spiritual finale. That wish is fulfilled halfway. Abbado opens with calm control, without much inner feeling. It's beautiful in its own way, true, but anyone who has heard the fervor and intensity of Karajan knows what potential this music has. By leaving out any trace of struggle, Abbado only reduces the impact. If you want a subdued, gorgeous finale without the overwhelming emotion, Abbado serves the purpose very well. As the movement unfolds, I find more meaning. It took awhile for me to warm up to Abbado's approach, mainly because there's not the optimal personal involvement. Nothing is spectacular and there could be more impact, but the gentle atmosphere works in its own way. Ending the symphony on such a tender note left me moved, and once again saddened at the loss of such a great maestro.Comparing this reading with Haitink's with the LSO earlier this year, I prefer Abbado, since he's not so slow and trudge-like, even if Haitink came closer to sounding spiritual. Certainly we are far removed from the impact of Karajan, who many consider unbeatable in this music. For those who don't mind less bombast, Harnoncourt with the Vienna Phil is more moving, and Rattle's recent recording was thrilling on a sheer virtuosic level, and it includes the controversial fourth movement. The problem for me with Abbado is that he doesn't dig into the elusive nature of this symphony. Playing it straight risks losing the novelty.But if you want Bruckner that is serious and full-sounding without being so intense, this is just perfect. Die-hard Abbado fans like myself are nearly certain to go out of their way, if mainly for the novelty of a posthumous new release. I can safely award this album four stars for its perfect calm control, while preferring more involved readings by a good margin.[from theclassicalcommentator.blogspot.com]","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CXO5OZWIFJ78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJ2024S#wasThisHelpful","R2CXO5OZWIFJ78","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this final release in his Brahms cycle, Vladimir Jurowski naturally finds himself competing with Valery Gergiev, his elder Russian compatriot also at the head of a major London orchestra. I was disappointed with Gergiev's cycle, which was moderate and resigned with almost no new ideas. Did Jurowski eclipse the more experienced Gergiev, and more importantly, did he prove that the Russians have a legitimate approach to Brahms?Thanks partly to the clearer sonics, we instantly hear that Jurowski's Brahms is much fresher than Gergiev's. The opening movement of the 3rd Symphony feels alive and warm, and Jurowski voices with compelling impact. It's a tad on the lean side, though; it sounds more modernist than romantic. But it's more moving than I was anticipating. It has a very precise, rhythmic feel, but nothing seems stodgy--Jurowksi is fully involved. Heading into the heart of the movement, Jurowski doesn't try to compete with the heft of the Berlin Phil. He is still fairly lean, but again, surprisingly moving. He's not simply going through the motions, even if he's not outright passionate and far from turbulent. This is comparatively smooth sailing over a land of incredible beauty, realized impeccably. The back and forth between the strings is immaculate. Proceeding into the closing minutes, Jurowski is excitable, but he doesn't try to build to a ringing climax in the way that Karajan and Rattle do. He's entirely stripped of any pretense of nobility. It sounds a bit aloof, but only by a little.Starting the 2nd movement, things feel a tad breezy. Jurowski certainly isn't waiting around to let the meaning sink in. He insists on keeping the line flowing, albeit with warm, loving detail. He's anything but Germanic; is this Brahms posing as Tchaikovsky? The line can feel impatient at times, only Jurowski can turn around and apply generous rubato. It all feels very un-Brahms, if I may say so, completely devoid of any nobility. Coming to the 3rd movement, we're becoming accustomed to the feel, which is warm, crisp, and to the point. Jurowski isn't specializing in richness or depth; he's not going to be caught lingering. He feels tender and sensitive once again, with traces of melancholy, although his outlook is resoundingly positive.Jurowski stirs up a nice bit of energy in the finale, only he runs the risk of becoming brisk. He doesn't dig in, and the sound is clear-eyed and almost unaffected. Again, there's a stress on accuracy, even if it's never cold. Details are remarkably clear, and there's several times more life than with Gergiev. He almost bounces at times, with a surprising lack of gravity. Heading into the gorgeous closing bars, the mood is as sharp and to the point as at the beginning, still beautiful in its own way while being completely removed from the usual sound world of Brahms.We've gotten a good taste of Jurowski's style in Brahms by now, so as we'd expect, he starts out the 4th Symphony with a graceful lilt instead of grandeur. It is gentle and swaying, not dark and turgid. It's refreshing on the one hand, yet as the movement progresses, one does wish there could be more passion. This is sensitive conducting that finds whole layers of new detail. Again, it can't be overemphasized just how un-Germanic and rigorous this is.The 2nd movement is at once dry eyed and opulent. The London Philharmonic plays masterfully, and if you don't mind that the pathos isn't dominating, this is touching in its own way. Those of us who want the core of our soul to be touched won't be finding it here, though. Jurowski is still lean, as full as the orchestra sounds. That seems ironic, but as persuasive as his force is, he is avoiding a colossal sound. We head into the Scherzo with a steady trot, once again without bombast. This is light, carefree Brahms. Should one complain about the missing richness or rejoice in the abundant energy? I tend towards the latter, actually, and if nothing else, it's great to hear new ideas. It's one of the most energized accounts on disc.Jurowski is jagged coming into the finale, with strong emphasis and swirling sounds. He's not very fateful. He's far from slack, though, and he proceeds with plenty of his own excitement. He simply doesn't allow himself to subscribe to the age-old traditional Brahms sound. We're not used to Brahms this clear-eyed, forward, and modernist. The ending itself has an abrupt ritard followed by an equally abrupt accelerando. It's eccentric but extremely interesting.To come back to our original question, did Jurowski prove himself in this repertoire? Certainly he is far more convincing than Gergiev, as odd as this disc is in some ways. Unlike Gergiev, one does feel that Jurowski has his own originality. I usually demand more overt passion and romantic splendor in Brahms, but the conducting here sparkles with inspiration. I find Karajan, Bernstein, Tennstedt, and Rattle more consistently gripping, but I'm quick to welcome anything with a fresh breath of air. Jurowski qualifies, so I've decided to compromise and give this CD 4 and-a-half stars. I'll be sure to return to it. And in the wider perspective, this disc only increases Jurowski's credibility for consideration at another major European post. If the Berlin Philharmonic isn't eyeing him, they should be.[from theclassicalcommentator.blogspot.com]","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D7K8U697SSGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZALWLA#wasThisHelpful","R2D7K8U697SSGQ","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[this review is for Welser-Most's reading with the Mahler Youth Orchestra. Amazon has mistakenly combined the reviews for multiple recordings.]After years of being one of Strauss's neglected masterpieces, the Alpine Symphony has gotten a number of very good recordings in the past decade, this reading from Franz Welser-Most and the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra among them. I find the work memorable, so it's great to suddenly have a number of viable options.We instantly hear that the youth orchestra is capable and inspired. Their individuality is unmistakable. They play with vividness, delivering a compact sound without aiming for bombast. It makes sense to view the Alpine Symphony as a more pastoral, searching work, and Welser-Most is wise to be fervent without constantly looking to deliver fireworks. The variety of careful beauty is remarkable. Yet Welser-Most shows no passivity; for all the attentive balance, there's a great feeling of freedom and spontaneity, a lilt, even.If this performance is pictorial at times, it's never passive. Welser-Most seems willing to sacrifice sheer thrill in favor of lyrical phrasing. It works, because he is captivating and nearly mercurial.Quite a bit of the material in the Alpine Symphony is elusive and shadowy, perhaps the reason it took listeners so long to warm up to it. These moments find Welser-Most at his best, since he doesn't view them as mere interludes betwixt the main episodes, a trap conductors easily fall into. The youth orchestra can't compete for impact with the best European orchestras. All the same, they play with verve and passion. Welser-Most is more worried about finding musical meaning than creating a big display, and it works like a charm.Is this recording a success? Absolutely, but for those looking for their one and only copy of the work, I can't put it above Christian Thielemann with the Vienna Philharmonic or Daniel Harding with the Saito Kinen Orchestra. Freewheeling spontaneity may be what enables this disc to stand out, especially with the youth element. This isn't really a refined interpretation, even if it's sensitive. It's in a more searching mood, but probably not as much as Harding, if more so than Thielemann. EMI's sonics are good, if rather distant at times.At the end of the day, this reading avoids becoming an ostentatious show, but it doesn't try to sound polite either. It is genuine music-making in the truest sense. I think there's enough variety in Strauss's composition to make it worth acquiring multiple versions, and this CD certainly should be one of them. Freedom and individuality abound; the interpretation never comes closes to relying on detail or sonics for its impact.[full review on http://theclassicalcommentator.blogspot.com/2014/10/welser-most-is-captivating-and-vibrant.html]","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WBIR09CEWVIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B63IDE#wasThisHelpful","R1WBIR09CEWVIE","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've found it thrilling to follow Alisa Weilerstein, the young American cellist who has suddenly come under the spotlight in the past few years. It makes sense that Decca is releasing her first solo album, since her charisma is thrilling all by itself. Earlier this year, she was galvanizing in the Dvorak concerto, only I found that she had several times more imagination than her conductor, Jiri Belohlavek. Her tone showcases an incredible warmth and richness, all delivered with the power of one of the rare greats.I'm not a solo cello aficionado, so all the works on this disc were new to me. I'd dare to guess, though, that most prospective buyers will be enticed based on their satisfaction with Weilerstein's concerto discs, as I was myself. I found the most delight in the first work on the program, the Kodaly Sonata for Solo Cello. But there's plenty of interest in the Bright Sheng Seven Tunes Heard in China, which has a strong folk flavor. For me, the most important part of this disc is that Weilerstein plays everything with the same golden tone, the same variety, and the same concentration. She seems unable to play without inserting her own personality, which I find gripping and moving. Decca captures her with close-miking, a bit larger than life. It just adds to the impact, though. Her ability to plunge beneath the depths of these scores is penetrating. I only hope she doesn't lose her raw passion as she continues to grow. It's not an everyday phenomenon.I don't usually review discs if I don't have prior familiarity with the compositions. I hope my readers can forgive me for giving way just this once. It's hard for me to keep back my enthusiasm. I'm now a committed fan of Weilerstein and can't imagine any fans of these scores going away without being impressed.

"Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet seems inherently virtuosic to me.  The music has a wealth of marvelous orchestration, and thankfully we have masterful readings with the Berlin Philharmonic from both Salonen and Abbado.  The Chicago Symphony is in very good shape today, and it helps that the sound on the CSO Resound label is full and rich.  Ricardo Muti favors the big, brassy sound that makes the orchestra famous.From the beginning, one hears a powerful sound from the orchestra, very much in a heroic mood. A problem begins to surface, however: Muti is rather aloof.  There's no blissful abandon here, and for all the crystalline attention to detail, there's a lack of grace. Although the sound of the orchestra is attractive, Muti seems to be admiring the music from a distance.  And one does hear a gentle building of emotion; it's just that romanticism is treated with caution.  Muti favors distinct thrusts of sound, so he seems a stranger to lilting energy.Muti is guilty of trying to replace interesting phrasing with perfectly balanced legato pianissimos.  Prokofiev's orchestration is a marvel, and Abbado with the Berlin Phil is mesmerizing, enable the sound to soar with gripping lyricism.  Muti is only putting one foot ahead of the other, even if the orchestra plays effortlessly. I wish Muti could let off the reigns, because his pinpointed insistence strips away the hints of danger and spontaneity.  It's frustrating, because I can't help but imagine what this orchestra could produce under an inspired conductor.Such luscious music certainly asks for more than unsmiling concentration.  The waves of bittersweet sorrow aren't here, stunning as the orchestra is.  The music should leave the listener torn in pieces, as I'd claim Abbado does memorably, but here the impact is lost.Especially given that others have recorded a better variety of excerpts from the ballet, this CD, despite the stellar sound and playing, is a letdown.  I can see fans of the orchestra being interested, because Chicago is truly gorgeous.  But Muti simply doesn't catch the spirit, falling short of the aforementioned Abbado and Salonen by a long mile.  Or you can always plump for the whole ballet, and Gergiev is galvanizing on the LSO Live.(full review on http://theclassicalcommentator.blogspot.com/2014/10/chicago-plays-marvelously-but-muti-is.html)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFSFGJE3JRI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4CA8UO#wasThisHelpful","R2BFSFGJE3JRI2","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perhaps in preparation for his upcoming post with the Munich Philharmonic, Gergiev has lately turned to the traditional romantic repertoire with the LSO.  He just finished his Brahms symphony cycle and now he's back to Belioz's Symphonie Fantastique, a decade after recording it with the Vienna Philharmonic.  Unfortunately, I found the Brahms set to be a great disappointment and I've worried that he is sacrificing too much of his own personality in an attempt to adapt with the romantic style.The work opens with a soft hush, Gergiev almost tip-toeing his way through the opening lines.  Unlike Jansons in a thrilling recording earlier this year, Gergiev doesn't have an overriding air of spookiness.  He prefers a sense of classical refinement, with intrinsic sensitivity. The execution is great, just rather timid. Gergiev does have a gift of sustaining interest in slow movements.  He was best in the inner movements in his Brahms cycle, and here the Scene aux champs flows effortlessly.  He doesn't match Jansons for underlying drama, but it's an accomplishment to achieve freshness. It's really the antithesis of Jansons' reading, though.  Jansons was decidedly modernist, while Gergiev finds his beauty in refined classicism.Most conductors compete to sound frightening and menacing in the March to the Scaffold, and thankfully Gergiev allows himself to bite into notes, leaving aside much of his restraint.  Fundamentally, this is still conservative-sounding Berlioz, but there's an inner energy that grabs the ear.  The finale is a wild ride of abandon that was revolutionary in its day, leaving room to question the validity of Gergiev's seriousness.  He is far from mundane, though, and the LSO plays with vigor and compelling virtuosity.  It's thrilling and involving while stopping short of greatness.A rather mixed review, then, since I admire many aspects of Gergiev's conducting yet find him too conservative throughout much of this recording.  In fairness, this disc is substantially better than his Brahms set, helping paint a brighter picture for his future.  On the other hand, I think this reading falls short of Gergiev's previous reading with the Vienna Philharmonic.  And the sound of the Barbican only makes the LSO sound more dry, making the music less luscious.  One looking for a new recording of this work should plump for Jansons' stellar account with the Bavarian Radio Symphony, which has a more involving interpretation in addition to the better playing and sound.(full review on http://theclassicalcommentator.blogspot.com/2014/10/better-than-gergievs-brahms-cycle-but.html)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0V01PQFUSG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MW5FBR8#wasThisHelpful","R2W0V01PQFUSG9","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of Dudamel's Mahler in the past; both his 5th with the Simon Bolivar Orchestra and his 9th with the Los Angeles Philharmonic were telling successes.  Although the ""youth"" part of his Venezuelan orchestra has been dropped, it's been a joy to see the level of talent Dudamel has encouraged.  A few years ago, it might have seemed a stretch to imagine the orchestra being prepared to tackle the massive Mahler 7th, but now they are fully up to the challenge.  They play with astonishing virtuosity.But has the increased level of playing threatened to take away the orchestra's exuberance?  Opening the symphony, Dudamel is a little deliberate, stressing lyricism and focused lines. Sonics are great, and climaxes ring with impact. Dudamel is more inward than spontaneous, and his flow is gentle and natural.  In a blatantly elusive symphony, however, is it wise to aim for a seamless feel?  The absence of jagged edges threatens to remove some of the originality.Mahler made his 7th Symphony problematic for interpreters by writing a large dosage of material that is shadowy and slowish. It's riveting when performed with the right element of suspense, but here Dudamel sounds too regular.  The playing is lovely and balanced with care, but is this supposed to be an everyday symphony? An overriding feel of sameness is hard to shake off.  The inner movements are polished and sophisticated, but almost devoid of terror.It's telling how much Dudamel's Simon Bolivar Orchestra has improved over the years, and listening to the opening of the finale, the brass are in top form, and fully ready to be judged by the strictest international standards. In fairness to Dudamel, he finds more energy than in the inner movements, and after all, it's a challenge to simply make sense of the score's tossing and turning.  Dudamel does, and for me, this movement is the highlight of the performance.  Passion comes through, and the energy is searing.After admiring all of Dudamel's past Mahler outings, this one comes as a disappointment overall.  Dudamel has been cited as the Bernstein of his generation, but in the Mahler 7th, Bernstein showed considerably more passion.  As perfect-sounding as this reading is, it lacks the mystery that makes this symphony special.  Dudamel wakes up for an invigorating finale, but four movements too late.(full review on http://theclassicalcommentator.blogspot.com/2014/10/12-dudamel-is-refined-and-subdued.html)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZHXGPEA15B0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHO6QC4#wasThisHelpful","RSZHXGPEA15B0","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Listeners are spoiled for choice with Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet, especially if you're looking for highlights instead of the whole ballet.  There are sumptuous, virtuosic accounts with the Berlin Phil under both Abbado and Salonen  The work is such an orchestral blockbuster that it almost plays itself now, but I remain a believer in the greatness of the work, and still find it emotionally moving.Despite acclaim from multiple critical circles, this reading sounds dispassionate to me.  Reviewers have cited Dutoit's clean, vivid way with the score, and I'll oblige that textures are balanced superbly, the Montreal Orchestra playing with clarity and detail.  But I find Dutoit emotionally removed, for all the color of his reading.  It's telling that a positive reviewer on Amazon admits that this reading lacks connection with the story of the two lovers, finding it thrilling for its sheer orchestral brilliance.I can accept that some may find acclimation with Dutoit's world, but I find it nearly grating to listen to this piece played without hints of passion or lovesick danger.  A quick comparison with Abbado, my personal favorite, shows what drama Dutoit chooses to leave out.  I'd go as far as to say that Dutiot ultimately sounds limp.  The idea of a French reading highlighting sophistication seems convincing enough, but the execution here sacrifices far too much to still keep my attention.So, risking flak from fellow listeners, I can only fairly report that this CD left me unmoved, and I actually had to make myself listen all the way through.  Refinement and polish are here in abundance, but don't expect any acclimation with the story line.(from my review on theclassicalcommentator.blogspot.com)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R9UI2QX33CC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000041XN#wasThisHelpful","R3R9UI2QX33CC3","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As superhuman as Karajan was in his day, all musicians have their limits, their blind spots.  So it's hard to know how to approach this disc, one flawless in execution and full of incredible sounds, yet seemingly removed from the sound world of the composer.  Karajan seemed to miss the wistful, tuneful qualities in Schubert's music, perhaps one of the rare side effects of his incomparable intensity.Now that the authentic movement has had significant influence in the early romantic repertoire, Karajan's thick, wholly romantic way in the Schubert ""Unfinished"" Symphony would be a shock to more than a few ears.  It's devoid of charm, but the power is overwhelming.  Since the Symphony is rather darkish anyway, one can make an argument for it.  The intensity is weltering,  and the cumulative effect of the orchestra's tone chilling in its translucency.  This approach works best if you close your eyes and imagine you're listening to an orchestral interlude from Tristan und Isolde.  It's captivating to hear the orchestra at the height of its powers, no matter if the interpretation is atypical.I find Karajan more problematic in the 9th Symphony, though.  Here Schubert's writing is glorious, and if mystery and melancholy is stressed in the ""Unfinished"", in the 9th the scales are tipped towards joy and lyricism.  And those are the two elements completely missing in Karajan's conducting.  But Karajan isn't simply blunt, and he's not impersonal.  The Berliners play with phenomenal balance, although as a previous reviewer mentions, the brass do sound a little blatty.  It's a grand show, but I wish it could be more idiomatic, as impressive and the Berlin machine sounds; one feels too much of the spirit is trampled in the process.This reading leaves me feeling rather torn, then.  The power of the orchestra is spell-binding, but especially in the 9th, Karajan doesn't seem Schubertian enough.  But certainly there are many great qualities here.  I'm somewhat arbitrarily giving this album a four star rating, but it could easily be dropped to three for its lack of charm or raised to five for the perfection of the orchestral ensemble.  I'll have to to keep listening myself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21PA0FH4FUNOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000W99IK2#wasThisHelpful","R21PA0FH4FUNOI","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've appreciated much of Yuri Temirkanov's output, and it's been refreshing to hear his fresh, often distinctly Russian view in some of the core symphonic repertoire.  He is the oldest of a new tradition of great Russians, followed by Valery Gergiev and now Vasily Petrenko and Vladimir Jurowski.  It's been great to see these conductors bring new life to the musical scene.This reading of the Tchaikovsky ""Pathetique"" Symphony isn't one of Temirkanov's more remarkable recordings, though.  As great as a masterpiece as this work is, it does roll off the tongue easily, so I find myself asking for extra torque in readings.  Temirkanov's approach with the St. Petersburg Symphony isn't revolutionary but rather subdued, even if there is a hint of extra Russian flavor.  I find it thrilling when conductors read into the pathos, although Temirkanov seems content to deliver a reading with a moderate temperature.I can't deny that his commitment, though, so it wouldn't be accurate to consider this reading a mere run through.  It's not abnormally low on propulsion, but it doesn't stand out either.  The orchestra plays fine, but this can't be viewed as a virtuoso reading by the levels set by Karajan and Bernstein, with the Berlin and New York, respectively.  And in the modern era, there's the incredibly well-voiced and supremely sensitive reading by Jansons with the Bavarian Radio Symphony.  I find this reading enjoyable with some unique elements of its own, with a hint of Temirkanov's rugged passion, but this is far from a knockout.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22F1QN2NRY4GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002VYDZK#wasThisHelpful","R22F1QN2NRY4GI","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bernard Haitink's tendency towards modesty as a conductor shows a degree of rewards in Bruckner.  His patient hand builds lines with tenderness and one hears a feel for the long line.  Despite a tendency towards understatement, he rarely sounds glib in Bruckner, and can be quite moving.  Sometimes he can turn passive and sound rather aloof, as controlled and sensible as his conducting has always been.  A recent 9th with the LSO sounded too drawn-out and somber.This 9th comes from his earlier days with the Concertgebouw, and thankfully there's not the draggy pace heard on Haitink's latest recording.  Here tempo is moderate and moves with gentle fluidity.  The opening movement is free of struggle and is soothing in Haitink's understated way.  The Concertgebouw sounds gorgeous, as captivating in half throttle as in full cry.  Haitink's gift is his ability to accentuate Bruckner's simple beauty.  The affect isn't an instantaneous one; rather one is slowly entranced by the persistence of a burnished tone and Haitink's calmness.In some ways this reading is hard to diagnose, because as enjoyable as it is, Haitink leaves out a lot of angst and desperation that is welcome in Bruckner--some would say imperative.  A quick comparison with a great Brucknerian like Karajan reveals how smooth and straightforward this reading is.  In theory, I find myself disagreeing with a lot of Haitink's approach, but the interpretation easily holds me attention, for reasons I can't completely explain.  Perhaps my attraction is mainly due to Haitink's sense of love and awe.  Nothing sounds overworked and yet every note feels sincere and carefully considered.Four stars, then, since Haitink is very fine and moving in his own way, but his cautious bent does leave out a side of the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLOETT5FKXXQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E2LS#wasThisHelpful","RLOETT5FKXXQ8","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's ironic that Mariss Jansons has just recently decided to step down from the Concertgebouw after the 2014/15 season, as his announcement came shortly after he began to achieve startling success with his other major orchestra, the Bavarian Radio Symphony.  Health issues have dogged Jansons' footsteps for years, and I hope they don't cut his career short.  When inspired, Jansons truly joins the ranks of our greatest living maestros.Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique was a daring, revolutionary work in its day, but after decades of being a favorite of record companies, it takes interpretive skill to go beyond a rehashing of old tricks.  It hasn't been immune from the infiltration of HIP dogma; there's period performances from Norrington and Gardiner for those who think Berlioz's passion was intended to be diffused through prudish lenses.But Jansons takes the opposite tack.  His Bavarian Radio Symphony sounds full and luscious, with virtuosity comparable to Rattle's Berliners on their EMI recording.  But unlike Rattle who seemed reserved with a bent towards sheer orchestral beauty, Jansons uses the orchestration to add to the work's drama.  He actively seeks to bring out the mystery, in a way that is original and extraordinary.  The approach isn't so much romantic as modernist, actually.  One needs to adjust to a sound world that is extreme for its surprises and inherent spookiness.  On the surface Jansons can sound almost laid-back at times, until a closer listen reveals an unnerving unsettledness.  It's shadowy, held back just enough to add an element of tip-toeing suspense.This quality becomes apparent at the very start of the symphony, where Jansons brings a harrowing feel to thrice familiar bars and the builds the rest of the movement with verve and enough creepiness to make hairs stand on end.  Even the second movement's ball has a feeling of strangeness, as does the long pastoral Adagio, where effects like the echoing winds and approaching thunder from the timpani is ethereal and gripping.  The mood naturally persists with the two final movements, where Berlioz's radicalism is most prominent.  The previous reviewer quibbles that the Witches' Sabbath lacks the last forward push, but I'd be prepared to argue that Jansons' slight reserve simply adds to the spookiness.  In all, this reading is successful not because of overt excitement, as thrilling as the orchestra sounds in full cry.The  orchestral playing and the superb sound from BR Klassik are enough to make this recording worth hearing, but Jansons' inspiration is riveting, enough to push this reading to the very top of my list.  One gets the bonus of Varese's Ionisation, performed with the same terrifying bent, as different as the two compositions are.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFHGORB6CFU38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPZZOIQ#wasThisHelpful","RFHGORB6CFU38","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The two previous reviewers have both diagnosed this new Schumann set as the latest outing of HIP-inspired leanness, which is an accurate assessment.  In fairness, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe is far more proficient than your average period band, and their playing is beyond competent.  But the whole concept of chamber Schumann is a controversial one.  Yannick Nezet-Seguin clearly favors textures that are crisp and airy, leaning away from anything that sounds romantic.I'm not entirely opposed to the concept of smaller ensembles in Schumann.  Harnoncourt's set of the symphonies with this same orchestra was eccentric as usual, but I heard fresh interpretive ideas that were spell-binding.  But here everything sounds merely breezy, with no intrinsic structure.  A complaint I often have in Schumann is that interpreters are too serious and straight-faced when the music asks for more lyricism and energy.  So when I first turned on this new set, for a minute or so I was very optimistic.  For once, everything sounded alert and energized.  Tempos leaned on the faster side, meaning nothing would run the risk of sounding draggy.The problem?  In the process of removing a romantic sheen that has admittedly been too overbearing in the past, Nezet-Seguin has stripped the grandeur and meaning.  It doesn't take more than a couple minutes of listening until the superficial nature of the interpretation starts to show through.  There's a bit of sparkle on the surface, and the mood is cheery, but when the fundamental character suffers from anemia, everything else goes too.  I found myself wondering if Nezet-Seguin believed he had anything to say.  Is the point that he thinks Schumann should sound light and emotionless?  Either way, the result smacks of a certain glibness and almost haphazard focus.  Even in an atmosphere that should sound more intimate, I can't say I hear anything remarkably songful.All it takes is a quick listen to Bernstein's Schumann with the New York Phil and the comparison is devastating.  It's possible to be energized, tuneful, and flexible without sounding weak and callow.  I'll admit this set let me down.  Popular favorites like Sawallisch and Kubelik didn't leave me wholly fulfilled. And as much as I appreciate Karajan's own set with the Berlin Phil, there is a certain truth to the idea that Schumann thrives with a level of spryness and loving touch.  I had hopes that Nezet-Seguin could produce that kind of an interpretation, but the results are clipped and spiritless.  Only those who think a quick, lean run-through has rewards in Schumann need go out of their way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HV8SVRY08Z1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX02N3C#wasThisHelpful","R3HV8SVRY08Z1N","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Other reviewers have expressed surprise at how well Antonio Pappano has fared with his Italian orchestra in Rome.  I'll chime right in.  The Mahler 6th has enjoyed a wealth of great readings from major orchestras, and it would be easy to overlook this reading from a comparatively minor Italian orchestra.Understandable as such apprehensions are, they overlook Pappano's mastery, which enables him to approach the symphony with a breath of fresh air.  Pappano doesn't try to compete with his many rivals for virtuosity or orchestral impact.  Instead, he searches for lyricism with a feel of sweeping vivacity.  At a quick glance, such an approach might sound like a dosage of Mahler-lite.  Quite to the contrary, Pappano phrases with conviction that adds to the tragedy.  Is it possible to be songful while still digging below the surface?  In this case, absolutely.  The result can be almost breathless at times, and rather harrowing.As much as I love the Mahler 6th, it can easily become exhausting.  That was my complaint with the classic Karajan reading, which made incredible impact but ran the risk of sounding too inflexible.  Somehow Pappano maintains the intensity while standing out for freewheeling inspiration.  It's volatile, and comes across as without a trace of pre-meditation.  Lines sound rough-hewn with no attempt to smooth anything over.  There's nowhere near the virtuosity heard on Abbado's Berlin reading from a few years prior, but it really doesn't matter.  The music-making is undeniably inspired and my attention is kept from beginning to end.Collectors may want to know that Pappano places the Scherzo second, and at over fourteen minutes takes longer than Bernstein, Karajan, Tennstedt, Abbado, Jansons, and Gergiev, to list the recordings I used for comparison.  Even with this kind of slower tempo, the impact is still definite, if not as driving.  The finale, which can easily seem to go on forever, has enough variety and interpretive ideas that I don't catch myself looking at my watch.  It's hard to overemphasize the combination of a singing tone with visceral impact and intensity.All told, this reading has earned a place of respect on my shelves.  I haven't heard much comparable Mahler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YLHHRUYG3J8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MLQF06#wasThisHelpful","R1YLHHRUYG3J8X","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is at once the blessing and the curse of today's modern era that musicians can master the notes of complicated symphonic works with less hassle than several decades ago.  It's a blessing because it enables us to hear greater variety and detail and a curse because it's now easier to run through the motions.  The variability winds up being the conductor, who has a myriad of options if he decides to actually interpret.  In the Nielsen Fourth and Fifth symphonies offered here, Sakari Oramo is competing with Colin Davis, who fully mastered the symphonies in one of his last recordings for LSO Live.  It was thrilling to hear Davis utilize the virtuosity of a great modern orchestra while still digging in with raw power.The Royal Stockholm Orchestra doesn't come to my mind when I think of front rank orchestras, but being Scandinavian gives them more acclimation to Nielsen, no doubt.  In any event, listening to their new Fourth one hears playing that is accomplished and and secure, with Oramo relishing in layers of detail.  Interpretively, Oramo is definitely more low key than Davis, and he doesn't seek for propulsion.  Certain lines jump out with new clarity, and Oramo has firm control.  Going back to Barbirolli's reading with Halle, one hears an immense gap in the quality of orchestral playing.  But does Oramo smooth out the textures too much?  I wish for slashing strings and dark undercurrents, but Oramo sounds calmly traditional too much of the time.  His mastery is undeniable though, if one isn't looking for drama and force.  I'll confess I am; I wish I heard the unsettledness the previous reviewer cites.In the Fifth, Oramo faces more competition, with a recent reading from Mark  Elder and Halle alongside Davis, not to mention the classic great from Bernstein.  Once again, we get a similar interpretation that is controlled and rather calm.  It's less harrowing, cutting down on any tendency towards recklessness, but wasn't this supposed to be frightening music?  Especially in the first movement, with its eerie world of swirling lines in the strings and woodwinds, I wish Oramo would read into the portentous mystery.  He aims to sound beautiful instead and succeeds halfway--sounds are lovely but the emotionality is rather vague.My feelings are less than enthusiastic, but those who want every detail played out without ""intrusion"" from the podium could easily mark this as their first choice.  I'm in a different camp musically, which leaves me recognizing the fidelity Oramo gives to detail and overarching structure while still leaving unmoved.  Davis is truly better in every way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5SYFIWR2QYCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP909HO#wasThisHelpful","R5SYFIWR2QYCR","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simultaneously the principal conductor of the Concertgebouw and the Bavarian Radio Symphony, Mariss Jansons has been forcing me to rethink his potential as a conductor.  In the past, I've viewed Jansons as being predominately too tame, with expert conducting that often fails to catch fire.  In the past several months, we've heard an astounding Britten War Requiem and Berlioz Symphonie Fantastique, both with the Bavarian Radio Symphony.  I worried that the sudden thrust of inspiration was temporary, but this new release raises my hopes even higher.The disc opens with Shostakovich's 6th Symphony.  Jansons has long been considered a Shostakovich specialist, but his refinement has kept him from having the natural flair one attributes to Gergiev, Petrenko, and Jurowski, among modern native champions.  His Shostakovich has tended to sound smooth, running the risk of sounding unnecessarily slick, despite some good intentions.  Here Jansons doesn't compete with the aforementioned Russians for spontaneity and intuition, but he has a lot going for him with the the playing of the splendid Bavarian orchestra and BR Klassik's sound, which is literally incomparable even in today's modern era.  My familiarity with the work is limited, so I'll refrain from passing definite judgment, but my instinct tells me Jansons is musically convincing within his more subdued framework.  There's a rich sound to the orchestra that adds expansiveness and tantalizing details.  I'd also postulate that his conducting sounds more engaging than usual, with enough energy to produce success.It's easy for a conductor to run through the motions in Tchaikovsky's ""Pathetique"" Symphony, despite the greatness of the work.  As enjoyable as Tchaikovsky's symphonies are, collectors will attest that too many readings are afflicted with sameness. Critics struggle to avoid building unintended prejudices in relating to musicians, and I'll confess my prior assessment of Jansons would have condemned him as the wrong man for the job in this work.  While it's true that Jansons avoids anything rough-hewn or  unsophisticated, he finds a way to bring all the subtleties of the orchestration to life, increasing the emotional impact in the process.  Jansons is too beautiful to seem portentous, but he finds a definite pulse and finds strength in shaping textures with startling vividness.  It's as if though you can hear each instrument in the orchestra, playing with finesse while still sounding virile and passionate.  Jansons isn't keen on fire or Russian abandon, but his conviction is outstanding and definitely distinctive.What pushes Jansons' conducting into the realm of greatness is his ability to carefully mold phrases without giving way to pretentiousness or over-refinement.  Sometimes he seems to nearly caress the music, but it adds to the pathos instead of distracting.  I'm coming to see this as his defining talent, and one that can give him the edge over Simon Rattle, another conductor with a world-class orchestra who favors ultra-detailed voicing.It would be unfair to categorize this as a calm reading, though, at least in the face of a thrilling third movement that kept me riveted from beginning to end.  For sheer energy, it outstrips nearly all the readings in my library, and for sound and playing and I can't think of anything to put up against it.  Also captivating is the second movement, where Jansons finds a way to be free-flowing and achingly tragic all at once.  At the end of the day, Jansons' tender, aching phrasing is what has me mesmerized.  I repeatedly found myself replaying sections that stood out for supreme virtuosity and interpretive ingenuity, but the cohesive impact is undeniable.I'm happy to announce that Jansons has triumphed yet again, as he continues to rise in my estimation.  I'll be following him more closely in the future with higher expectations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ERZRZV3L1XJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J37PRSQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ERZRZV3L1XJC","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a rising young British conductor befriended by Claudio Abbado and Simon Rattle, among others, Daniel Harding's career has been almost elusive. He shows potential and signs of greatness, but without a prominent permanent station as a conductor, he seems to find somewhat scattered and varied engagements, almost as if he's in a self-induced testing period. He's developed a name for himself in Brahms, Mahler, and Britten, but this new disc of Strauss' Alpine Symphony with the Saito Kinen Orchestra was a surprise.I'm coming to think a lot of Harding, and this reading adds to my respect. The Saito Kinen Orchestra has made multiple recordings under Seiji Ozawa, but few are readily available in the US. As the previous reviewer mentions, the orchestra is composed of skilled virtuosos, and I was caught off guard by the impact of their sound--we should have the privilege of hearing them more often. Harding's conducting is natural and has a fluidity that transmits the range of orchestral color with surprising accuracy. It makes sense to view the symphony as something more of a journey than an adventure, as Harding does. Certainly one witnesses plenty of thrills here, but excitement seems secondary. Harding leans toward refinement where he could be charging at times.That's no complaint though, or at least not a major one. There's not too much gravity, and everything sparkles regardless of the temperament of the moment. There's as much enjoyment to be had enjoying the gurgling brook as in blazing the peaks of the Alps. Harding achieves continuity, a challenge in a piece where the wide spectrum of emotions can seem scattered if not carefully guided. Even after hearing great readings from Thielemann and Welser-Most, I'm not sure if either produce such a definite compact experience, even with the virtuosity of the Vienna Phil for Thielemann or the exuberance of Welser-Most's youth orchestra. It would be wrong to suggest that Harding comes across as cautious, but like Dudamel in a recent Zarathustra with the Berlin Phil, he realizes there's as much dramatic potential in building lyrical tenderness as in accentuating sheer force.In almost every way this new Alpine Symphony is praiseworthy, and Decca's vivid sonics could make this the primary modern choice. My admiration for Harding increases as he strikes a home run in repertoire I didn't previously associate with him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMYEBXDEYXWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJZOZFE#wasThisHelpful","R1GMYEBXDEYXWX","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brahms' 2nd Piano Concerto has been getting major billing from DG, as this new release comes just a few months after Helene Grimaud's recording with Andris Nelsons and the Vienna Phil.  Sticklers will rightly complain that this issue offers no fillers, but at least we have a true major release, not something to be taken for granted these days.In any event, if DG thought the greatness on this recording was reason enough for listeners to go out of their way, their bet should pay off.  From the very first bars, the undisputed mastery of a great pianist grabs the ears.  Pollini may not have all the brio of his younger self, but his phrasing sounds ageless, with agile expression that is nearly peerless.  It's easy to attack this concerto, stressing its nobility, but Pollini is playing where others are trying to make an imprint.  Of course Pollini finds many new things to say, but it sounds spontaneous; so many pianists sounds labored in Brahms.  As much as I appreciated Grimaud's recent recording, she can sound serious where Pollini is ecstatically entering a whole new sound world.Certainly Christian Thielemann adds to the success.  His Staatskapelle Dresden may not sound as sheerly beautiful as the Vienna Phil for Nelsons, but his conducting is much more involved, less of an accompaniment and more in the center.  But like Pollini, he doesn't push too hard.  This is Brahms that is energized, that never sounds ponderous, but its freewheeling adventurous spirit is hard to overemphasize.  I've rarely heard Brahms that is this momentous and yet so carefree.  This is not the stern bachelor composer stereo-typified in many minds.  Climaxes swell and the impact is definite, but the hint of pure joy is a welcome change, and truly an accomplishment in this music.  Simple forward motion without a strain of pretentiousness pays off.I concur with the previous reviewer that this may be the best of Pollini's three readings of this concerto, including the stellar one with Abbado and the Berlin Phil.  Needless to say, it also stands out in the discography as a whole.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R368S28DX770NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ8J5HO#wasThisHelpful","R368S28DX770NM","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Few symphonic works have earned the status of a warhorse as much as Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherezade.  It easily dazzles an audience, but many connoisseurs have grown tired of its rhetoric, which needs extra conviction to move beyond a cheap crowd pleaser.  The last thing we need is a conductor who is literal and runs through the motions.But that's what we have here.  Andre Previn chooses an approach that is gentle and subdued, emphasizing details with a real hint of caution.  The orchestra in this case is the ravishing Vienna Phil, and they play flawlessly, with a delicious violin solo.  I wish the conducting could have matched, because Phillips has clear sonics that help to bring the orchestra's great sound to life.  But Previn's choice to try to make real music by holding back on passion completely backfires.  Instead of enjoying the perfectly voiced climaxes, I find myself wincing from the lack of energy.In its own way, this reading is a model of perfection and correctness.  And there are times the effusive soul of the great orchestra comes through.  Previn's choices are well intended, no doubt, but they are underpowered.  Politeness is the the last thing this work needs, and when Previn tries to weave delicate lines with a admittedly responsive orchestra, it sounds overly cute.  But all the details are in place, so some listeners will no doubt be sympathetic.  I feel it's my duty to warn others that the conducting is tepid, regardless of its accuracy.

"Now that we have actually lost Claudio Abbado, it seems hard to imagine the Mahler discography without him.  He reached an apex during the end of his tenure at the Berlin Philharmonic and DG thankfully captured some stellar performances, this live Mahler 3rd among them.  In retrospect, Abbado seems to have represented the heights of modern virtuoso Mahler, the Berliners following his lead with the utmost poise, even delicacy.  It was the kind of dream marriage that will be exceedingly difficult to replicate.  I don't hesitate to predict that in several decades these DG recordings will be legendary, much in the same way that Bernstein's New York readings on Sony from the 1960's are today.Mahler started his 3rd Symphony with a famously long movement that was originally intended to evoke the awakening of summer.  Abbado sees a dichotomy between a poetic world of tantalizing beauty and a side of fierce, unbridled passion.  It takes skill to truly capture both sides of Mahler's emotional spectrum, and perhaps nowhere else in Mahler's output are disparate emotions thrown together so closely.  Abbado's ability to sound both raw and sensitive makes this movement a poetic journey of sheer ecstasy.  Even when the music feels crushingly devastating, there's a hint of hope that is wrenchingly emotional.  It's undeniably passionate, but also vulnerable and human.The transparency of the Berliners shines through in the 2nd movement.  Lyricism comes forth unhindered, as Abbado finds way to build drama  through beauty.  It's poetic, really.  It's hard to imagine more bliss, only there's still the unmistakable hint of volatile emotion.  In the 3rd movement Abbado doesn't match Bernstein for youthful energy, but once again the sheer sound of the Berliners has incredible impact.  And Abbado sounds truly fanciful, so that the sound world has a emotional range that is incomparable.  How does he manage to sound so ultra-detailed, fluid, and spontaneous all at once?I can only admire Anna Larsson's contribution in the 4th movement.  She is fervent and heartfelt, and Abbado follows suit with accompaniment that is sensitive and gentle, almost achingly so.  With the entrance of the children's choir in the 5th movement, the music is nearly overwhelming with its delicacy and grace.  Yet all is delivered with ravishing soul.  This is music making on a level impossible to describe.When I first heard the news of Abbado's passing, I quickly turned on this reading of this great finale.  Abbado finds such sublime peace and resignation amidst intense emotion and it's nearly heartrending.  As I find myself asking repeatedly when listening to this disc, how can music possibly sound so effortless and yet have such crushing emotional impact?  What's certain is that everything somehow comes together to make an interpretation that has extraordinary depth.  I don't know how anyone could listen unmoved.Critics are reluctant to give way to pure praise, but in the case of this Mahler 3rd, I think it's called for.  It's true that the sonics are not DG's best, but they are certainly not bad by any standard, even if you do have to turn the volume up more than usual.  I think the interpretation is great enough that a dedicated listener won't have time to quibble about the sound, which has been controversial here.  Everything is executed on such a high level, not only the incalculable accuracy of the Berliners but also the effusive passion of a great Mahlerian.  One cannot possibly ask for more.  Five stars plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Q329U34QJD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000063TAJ#wasThisHelpful","R17Q329U34QJD7","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Is it legitimate for an interpreter to perform a piece in a manner removed from what was intended by the composer?  Listening to this reading of the War Requiem from Gianandrea Noseda I found myself asking the question repeatedly.  Britten wrote the piece as an expression of his pacifist beliefs, dedicated to four of his friends who died in war.  It's a very private piece that is intensely moving.  Does the performer need to feel in touch with Britten's world of painful remorse for the tragedy of war?Noseda chooses to deal with the work's challenges not by underlining the pacifist undercurrent but by highlighting momentum and drive.  Suddenly we realize how much potential there is for frenetic energy.  There's a feeling of drive to this reading, which presses on and never lingers to make extra points.  The singing from the LSO Chorus is splendid, and they give extra incisiveness.  (The reviewer who says Noseda makes the work sound like Verdi's Requiem has a point.)  One expects some British refinement in this work, but Noseda can be almost brash.  Never does a phrase sound overly contrived and little sounds per-meditated--freshness reigns.  The LSO itself isn't voiced to capture orchestral detail, so the smaller orchestra doesn't ring with virtuosity as on Hickox's Chandos account.  Percussion is extra sharp, adding a thrill factor that I find hard to resist.Among the soloists, the standout is definitely Ian Bostridge, who sings with a combination of raw spookiness and poignant grief.  It could be argued that he has the impact of Peter Pears himself.  Certainly I've never heard anyone else sound so wrenchingly personal, and his vocal control is mesmerizing--just listen to the end of Agnus Dei.  Simon Keenlyside is also great, a Englishman for once in this part, and not too far behind Shirley-Quirk for Hickox.  The weakest point in the soprano, Sabina Cvilak, who suffers in her treacherous part with a good bit of Slavic wobble, but that seems to be almost the norm on disc.To summarize the impact of this reading, it's not one that stresses tragedy, so it's not the best choice if one wants to be emotionally moved.  But the sheer impact is irresistible, more than any other on disc.  I don't hesitate to recommend this reading, even if it may not have been what Britten had in mind.  Just expect to be surprised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4O0134ARU599/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00713Y2R6#wasThisHelpful","R4O0134ARU599","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lang Lang and Simon Rattle have worked together for years, so this new disc on Sony Classical comes after the two developed a fondness for each other.  Listening to Rattle's thoughts on working with Lang Lang, he seems almost in awe of his gifts and pleased to be working with him.  My fear was that Rattle would simply go along for the ride and succumb to fussiness, thereby dragging down the whole enterprise.But Rattle has shown affinity for both Prokofiev and Bartok in the past and thankfully in this case he is at the height of his game.  From the start of the Prokofiev 3rd Concerto we hear music-making that is truly mesmerizing.  Lang Lang plays with command boosted by his dazzling technique, delving into the work with a true sense of adventure.  He is a chameleon of the keyboard, finding many shades of color and elaborating with his combination of nuance and sheer charisma.  One might find his pianism less individual than past readings from Kissin and Argerich, who both mastered the work, but for dash and energy, Lang Lang probably surpasses them both.  The decisive factor in making this album a success may be Rattle, actually, who is sparkling and idiomatic, more so than Abbado with the same orchestra for both Kissin and Argerich.  He finds great variety all throughout the score but his naturalness caught me off guard--there's none of his afflicting self-consciousness.  The Berliners are beyond words and with the wonderful recorded sound, the experience could hardly be bettered.This Bartok 2nd comes on the heels of a great reading from Leif Ove Andsnes and Pierre Boulez with the same orchestra a few years back.  This reading is less precise and direct but the flexibility in the phrasing is truly remarkable.  Is it a bad thing that the scoring doesn't sound as percussive?  I don't think so, because we enter a whole new sound world that has plenty of energy, only it's less exhausting for the listener.  We've reached a point where musicians can afford to play challenging works like these without struggling to reach the end.  The danger is that we could lose some of the novelty in the process, but here are two modernists who skillfully make their way through the score, finding more meaning instead of less.  Rattle sees this music as having many facets of rich instrumental color, so once again the orchestral playing is simply gorgeous.  Lang Lang doesn't sweat his way through, playing instead with captivating control that is carefully guided and adept.  In all, I don't usually think of Bartok as having so much contrast; there's an almost whimsical feeling here that makes every bar fresh and often unexpected.I had apprehensions about the coupling of Lang Lang and Rattle, fearing they would feed off of one another's tendency towards fussiness.  Instead we have consummate musicianship that jumps to the top of the list for lovers of these concerti.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7Q4UFHV209IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV9QHB8#wasThisHelpful","R7Q4UFHV209IA","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recordings of the Brahms Violin Concerto are very common and we've had some major new ones lately.  One of the chief reasons to hear this disc, actually, is that it serves as a sampling of Chailly's Brahms' conducting before he releases a set of the symphonies later this fall.Leonidas Kavakos is a major violinist in his own right, so  I had hopes for this reading.  But the 1st movement turns out to be slow and rather deliberate.  Chailly chooses an aggressive style that digs into the orchestral part rather coldly.  The execution from the Lepzig Gewandhaus is very fine, but I'm not sure why these opening movement needs to be attacked. Instead of being invigorating, it drains it of its feeling of long melodic lines and borders on being flaccid.  As for Kavakos, his playing is refined with nice control but like Chailly, he seems more worried about heroism than effortless musicianship.  I can't say I hear anything extra special.  The same goes for the Adagio, which is reticent and tired-sounding where it could be freewheeling and inspirational.  Two movements of drawn-out grandeur seems a bit much.  Even in the finale the mood remains rigid.  In a movement  that should raise the roof, both Kavakos and Chailly seem more worried about making incisive sounds than letting loose.  In the end, the problem with this reading is that it is too sober, an impression I had on each of my three listens so far.Timing-wise we have generous fillers, but surely they could be more interesting than Bartok's Violin Rhapsodies and a scattering of Brahms' Hungarian Dances, both accompanied by piano.  It doesn't help that Peter Nagy's pianism is tame and completely uninvolving for me.  I still confess I don't hear anything compelling from Kavakos.  I'm guilty of being indifferent to these works in these arrangements, so perhaps there's more interest than I'm hearing.  As it is, I can only fairly report that I wasn't moved by any aspect of the playing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N5MTJ751LHV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5Q9VSW#wasThisHelpful","R3N5MTJ751LHV6","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It makes perfect sense to create a musical partnership between Yuja Wang and Gustavo Dudamel, both superstars with DG contracts.  With the added influence of the Simon Bolivar Orchestra of Venezuela, there's a great feeling of freshness and youthful spontaneity.  For all the thrill of excitement that these young musicians bring, some will worry that they'll show signs of inexperience.  Despite flashy careers and great popularity, some critics charge them of shallowness, and lack of intrinsic musicality.  Is there good cause for premonition?Starting off with the Rachmaninov 3rd Concerto, long a virtuoso display piece, we hear musicianship that is well-considered and very mature.  Rachmaninov readings of late have tended to shy away from gooey sentimentality in favor of more refinement and modernist sensibility.  Here the first two movements could almost be seen as dry-eyed, yet they move with flexibility and true involvement.  Every phrase sounds natural and there's dramatic undercurrent that lends a feeling of expectation.  Wang has an inspiring technique, so she tackles every challenge with no sign of stress.  But she doesn't simply run through the music either; she has commanding control and one feels she gives everything she has.  She chooses the shorter, easier cadenza in the first movement, something some listeners will bewail, but it's a minor cavil either way.  In the finale we get to hear actual fireworks for the first time, with both Wang and Dudamel letting go with frenzied abandon.  I can't imagine anyone listening without being captivated by the sheer charisma of these musicians--it's quite an experience.If anything the Prokofiev 2nd Concerto is better and there's comparatively little competition.  With its percussive, modernist idiom, it hardly hurts when interpreters take it with towering precision and unbounded energy.  It's a thrilling display of pyrotechnics here.  Nothing sounds brusque though, and it's a good thing that Wang can be biting and sarcastic without banging out the notes.  There's freedom in the phrasing actually, which makes the piece playful without wearing on the listener's ear.  Dudamel is vivacious and makes the most out of the rip-roaring orchestral part--the orchestra plays with surprising accuracy.  In all, the force of two fiery young musicians makes this concerto a romp from beginning to end.There's a chance this recording will be a divider, since there's a unique combination of refinement and dynamic involvement that some will find self-conscious.  I can only argue that charisma wins out in the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FLLPW4AEWT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EBJ624O#wasThisHelpful","R3FLLPW4AEWT9","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It must be an emotional experience for a gifted, dynamic pianist to approach the heights of the piano repertoire recording Brahms with a talented young maestro and two of the best European orchestras. Helene Grimaud clearly views these concertos as life-changing works, and here we have a serious major release that asks to be the most attractive one of both concertos since Pollini and Abbado, also on DG.Approaching the 1st Concerto, we soon realize that Grimaud boasts great magnetism. She takes this beast of a concerto with an authoritative technique that leaves no doubts about her control. Every bar has the undisputed mastery that defines the greatest pianists. But what is most striking is her imagination, which defies the common conception that this is a ponderous, rambling concerto. She grabs the ear with phrasing that weaves the most beautiful lines without ever becoming self-conscious or losing her grasp. It's hard to fathom a more perfect marriage, ""invincible yet vulnerable"", as she put it. Everything is majestic, yet personal to the point of being nearly painful. And the variety she displays is breathtaking, from moments of near stillness in the gorgeous slow movement to the towering force of the finale, which sounds titanic yet gloriously adventurous--has anyone bettered it? At the podium, Andris Nelsons lets Grimaud carry the show, with accompaniment that is never aggressive. He prefers gentle refinement to open drama, which sounds like a bad idea, but it is the perfect compliment to Grimaud. He shares her sensitivity, to be sure, so the Bavarian Radio Symphony never sounds stiff. He conducts with great finesse, choosing sweet lyricism that truly sounds free.Coming to the 2nd Concerto, we get a very similar approach, only the music is more inspiring and we now have the Vienna Phil. Actually, Grimaud logically views this concerto as more intimate than its predecessor, so this reading is rich, colorful, and always reflective--very autumnal, really. A quick listen makes this reading sound low key and it almost is. There's not much barnstorming. But Grimaud uses reflection as a vehicle to exploit the most captivating emotions. She's as mesmerizing when she phrases with tenderness as when she displays her full powers. She seems to be searching for meaning, using the concerto's nobility to communicate on a level of the deepest sincerity. It's grand and soaring with freedom, yet there's an element of fragility caused by the complete emotional vulnerability. It's hard to describe how gripping she is for those who haven't heard it. Nelsons adds to this feel with conducting that is surprisingly resigned. He sounds natural and fluid, yet he rarely produces sheer excitement. Sometimes it may catch the listener off guard, especially in the 2nd movement where he breathes a quick prayer where one expects blazing triumph (the start of the new theme in D around 4:45). Some will think he goes too far in his refined ecstasy, but what might not work by itself sounds perfect with the volatile Grimaud at the keyboard. I don't hesitate to place this reading with the best from Gilels, Barenboim, and Pollini.At the end of the day, this is Grimaud's show, and her pianism is unforgettable, transforming these indisputable masterpieces. Other pianists may be more dazzling, but few have been as poetic, much less while still maintaining such astonishing control. Bravo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S94XK7Z6492S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DEFW8YY#wasThisHelpful","R1S94XK7Z6492S","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Britten's War Requiem is soaked with such fervent emotion that it is hard for any interpretation to leave a listener unmoved.  Yet as one of the great modernist masterpieces, it leaves a wealth of options for the interpreter.  Should it be nakedly emotional, primarily soothing, grieving, or frightening?  All options seem legitimate, making the main imperative passion and complete commitment, regardless of the application.Mariss Jansons certainly doesn't favor the brand of all-out excitement as produced by Noseda on his recent LSO Live release.  In comparison, Jansons is quite subdued, with conducting that focuses on plaintive beauty over drama.  The Bavarian Radio Symphony plays very well and the recorded sound is clear and detailed, so we can hear a wide range of variety--more than usual.  For me that was the chief attraction to Jansons' conducting.  But Jansons' primary way of dealing with the puzzles of the score is to bypass them, lending a reading that sounds traditional instead of shocking.  The choral work in particular is balanced with great care and a sense of conservatism that makes the work sound rather like a regular mass.  In Dies Irae and Libera Me, there isn't nearly enough impact for me--this music wasn't meant for church.  On the plus side, the small orchestra plays with the most striking individuality and detail that I've heard since Hickox's great account.It's very good to have Emily Magee as the soprano soloist, without the Slavic wobble that inflicted many past readings.  Her delivery drips with intensity and a sense of harrowing fear.  Britten was merciless in his vocal writing, but Magee masters the challenges without much stress making her a true highlight.  Tenor Mark Padmore doesn't have the vocal authority of Pears or Langridge but with his sensitive, lyric voice he finds sorrowful beauty that can be tear-jerking.  He doesn't reach the level of Ian Bostridge, who has the ability to sound creepy and heartbroken all at once, but Padmore finds a unique place in the private, hushed passages which he sings with complete commitment.  German baritone Christian Gerhaher has a rich, smooth voice that is easy to enjoy, but of all the soloists he seems the most lacking in impact.  The agonized moments in Libera Me are rather straightforward.  His tone is gorgeous; he simply doesn't follow a strong emotional line, something this work asks for.At the end of the day, there are many fine aspects to this reading, but mainly due to Jansons the work doesn't fulfill its dramatic potential.  There are many things to enjoy though, so for fans of the work the effort may be worth it for the playing and sound as well as the singing from Magee and Padmore.P.S. April 2014: Ouch--I badly misjudged this reading.  On relistening, I hear greatness that enables Jansons to excel or match the best of the competition.  I'll hopefully get around to editing soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H56LRMM2O3KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F26AU2U#wasThisHelpful","R1H56LRMM2O3KQ","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's very good to see the Philadelphia Orchestra back in the hands of a major label after years of being restricted to minor labels like Ondine.  They have a star conductor in Yannick Nezet-Seguin, who has been rising to international prominence and brings a new DG record contract with him.  There have been doubts about Nezet-Seguin's true talent though, so I viewed this disc as a test of his abilities.Certainly this reading of Le Sacre should help to boost his reputation.  There's a definite sense of inspiration from the podium and Philly fans will be overjoyed to hear the orchestra in such good form.  There's no mistaking this orchestra for the Berlin Phil (which released a staggering Le Sacre with Rattle earlier this year) but they play with freedom and don't struggle getting around the notes.  As for the interpretation itself, Nezet-Seguin doesn't attempt to make the score truly shocking, but that's the norm as we celebrate its centenary.  In its own right, this is a thrilling reading that has true energy to guide us through a palette of gorgeous colors.  Thankfully Nezet-Seguin doesn't linger over the notes or come across as at all studied.  If anything, this reading could use a bit more cohesion.  Nothing sounds savage yet there's a strong disjunct feel--the notes seem to fly out of nowhere.  We don't experience the racing pyrotechnics of Salonen with the Philharmonia, but this reading certainly sounds more jagged than most.  Some things jump out at the listener, especially the slow hammering at the end of the ""Mystical Circles of the Young Girls"" contrasted with the sudden surge of speed at the start of the ""Glorification of the Chosen One"".  My only complaint is that we don't get the last thrust of inspiration from the podium.  A flaw of this conductor is that he can be frenzied and driven while the backbone of his vision suffers from pretentiousness.  That flaw isn't debilitating here, thankfully, but there's a small hint of self-consciousness that keeps this reading from being ranked with the greatest.It was a nice idea to pay tribute to Stokowski by including some of his Bach transcriptions, but the interpretations aren't special.  Nezet-Seguin decided to lean away from the dazzling showiness that distinguished Stokowski, but in so doing he drains much of the excitement and sounds rather plain faced.  The chief joy in listening to this transcriptions as interpreted here is the sound of a full, modern orchestra without touches of HIP style.  Nezet-Seguin doesn't show any affinity for religiosity so these readings don't resound with the necessary commitment.  But again, the orchestra is in perfect form and readings of these transcriptions aren't common.In all, this disc left me refreshed and hopeful for Nezet-Seguin's future, even if he still has room to grow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R257LUEZ658O1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBR1GSW#wasThisHelpful","R257LUEZ658O1R","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gustavo Dudamel has made a big splash on the international music scene and has fostered a great relationship with the Berlin Phil as a favored guest conductor.  Despite his reputation as a dazzling showman, it's been thrilling to follow Dudamel as he blossoms into a startlingly mature conductor.  Earlier this year we heard a great Mahler 9th from Los Angeles that had the all the commitment of a skilled veteran.Actually, it's about time to stop viewing Dudamel as up-and-coming and acknowledge that he's already arrived.  As a sad commentary on the state of the recording industry, very few discs from guest conductors have been released at Berlin during Simon Rattle's tenure.  (EMI wasn't generous with Rattle, either.)  Now that we finally can hear Dudamel at the helm of this great orchestra, we hear how masterly he truly is.  It must be a temptation for a young maestro to be enamored in the sound of the Berliners and forget to deliver an actual interpretation.  But Dudamel conducts with authority that gives no hint of a need to grow.  He produces a wonderful, rich sound that brings out the individuality of the Berliners, yet there's no pretentiousness or fussiness.  His control is truly captivating.Karajan was a great exponent of Strauss, with a particularly gripping reading of Also Sprach Zarathustra on Decca with the Vienna Phil, but neither Abbado or Rattle have recorded it.  Dudamel has the advantage of impeccable modern sound from DG which produces maximum impact.  The thrill of hearing the most dazzling virtuosos in the world give their all is twice as mesmerizing when we feel we can hear each individual instrument no matter how crushing the total volume.  Dudamel certainly deserves a lion's share of the credit for achieving dramatic continuum that revels in each moment without either loitering or becoming impatient.  In a promotional video, Dudamel said he viewed this live recording as one of the high points of his career.  It's easy to agree in the face of conducting that is so natural and effervescent.  I'd have to agree with the previous reviewer who finds Dudamel particularly thoughtful and measured.  I'd also agree that the fillers don't have the same impact, but they're still a treasure in their own right--readings on this level aren't released every day.At this point I think Dudamel's boyish image as portrayed by the media has traces of inaccuracy, at least in relating to his actual style.  All throughout this disc there is a feeling of abandonment but also of complete confidence.  Dudamel comes to the core of the Germanic repertoire with freshness, to be sure, but with definite indications of experience.  It's a marvel hearing him guide the orchestra with adeptness that balances everything perfectly while still welding everything into compact, intense whole.Considering that Berlin is searching for a new conductor in 2018, a major new release like this one makes one wonder if Dudamel is posing as a candidate.  He's a dark-horse candidate to be sure, but I have no doubt that he is better prepared for the task than Christian Thielemann , the current favorite.  In the meantime, we have a Strauss disc that is truly unforgettable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GRGUWDK7TTK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2MC8WG#wasThisHelpful","R3GRGUWDK7TTK0","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karajan was a great exponent of Richard Strauss, but there's something truly extraordinary even for him about this recording, as other reviewers have noted.  It has a great sense of freedom, a contrast from the famous Berlin recording remastered on the DG Originals series.  Karajan represented the very heights of greatness as a conductor, but he rarely relaxed or loosened his intense grip.  That was actually an incredible strength of his, but showpieces like Also Sprach Zarathustra can use transparent virtuosity, which the DG Originals disc doesn't have.That's all a prelude to saying that on this Vienna Phil reading from 1960, Karajan finds an almost rhapsodic voice that is probably unparalleled.  In this case, the orchestral playing is voiced with freshness that allows the individuality and deliciousness of the Vienna Phil to come forth.  There's a naturalness that reminds us that the Vienna Phil is to the manner born in Strauss.  Instead of being hit by one huge sheen of sound as on the Originals, we hear many layers of orchestral color.Never fear though, for Karajan hasn't lost his masterly hand.  The added feeling of freshness doesn't mean that Karajan has cut back on intensity.  There's still a great feeling of decisiveness and the ability to phrase with pinpoint accuracy.  It's a rare combination that should be celebrated.  While other virtuoso readings of these work have sprung up, the passion and Karajan's complete affinity for Strauss would be hard to match.  You'd never know that Zarathustra is an oft-played work that has become a sonic blockbuster.  The generous fillers ring with the same fervency.  The Dance of the Seven Veils actually seems to lilt.One could go into detail about the specifics of each interpretation, but I'll leave the discovery to the listener.  All I can say is that it is indispensable and belongs in any Strauss library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GEZRZB3NN7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000428L#wasThisHelpful","R32GEZRZB3NN7Y","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now that Richard Hickox has been gone for half a decade, it seems safe to say that this reading is the most popular in his wide-ranging discography.  It's easy to understand why.  The initial attraction may be that it is the world premiere recording of the original 1913 edition of the ""London"" Symphony but I can attest that this makes up for only a fraction of the disc's novelty.  Hickox made a great name for himself in British music of all stripes, but there's a feeling of monumentality here that is astonishing even for him.The advantage of this edition is that there is much more to hear, while the standard edition boasts greater compactness.  Musicologists may argue over which option is the better one, but it does seem clear that this original edition would be harder for an interpreter to pull off.  But the miracle of this recording is that Hickox goes beyond maintaining cohesive flow and makes the symphony intensely moving.  He has a careful hand that deftly balances every nuance and the LSO plays with total commitment and striking sensitivity in some of the softer passages.  Chandos has given us natural sound with great detail, so that's yet another plus.I don't usually connect Vaughan Williams with dramatic impact, but this reading has enough energy that the symphony is suddenly quite invigorating.  There are moments that ring with true passion and great fervency.  Hickox makes the symphony seem vast in scope whereas as most readings are reminisces of the good old days in London.  Hickox doesn't drain any of the beauty, though.  He uses it to build his argument, finding a way to be lovely and intense at the same time.  In comparison, there just isn't the same variety in readings from Boult, Slatkin, and Elder.It's hard to praise this reading enough.  It belongs in an honored spot in any Vaughan Williams collection.  I've never heard any other Vaughan Williams conducting quite as compelling as what we witness on this disc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WPCIU8YAJSSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005B54X#wasThisHelpful","R1WPCIU8YAJSSW","A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30JFEZEVKQ7ZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He ended up taking care of everyone, and we follow his journey, from a child to an indentured servant, to being indebted to another for several years, to being in the Civil War, and then back home and how his life finally ends up.A real page-turner from the first to the end and I highly recommend this book, it will linger with you for a long time.I received this book through Net Galley and the Lake Union Publishing, and I was not required to give a positive review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AHWNY02PO7O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLWQH10#wasThisHelpful","R2AHWNY02PO7O5","A456NFKWB68YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A456NFKWB68YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Read in August, 2015Two a thick cardboard book for little hands to hold, with bright colors, and pictures of little ones trying to be grown up in an adult world. The little book is a page-turner for little ones to look at the colorful pictures, and see what their minds interpret in the pictures.As an adult reading the book, I sure wouldnât want my little one doing what the pictures portray, but the rhyming words and pictures made it a really cute read. Once in my little ones hands we had three straight reads, and many asks for more.This is a new and treasured book in my home, and so glad we received it.I received this book through Pump Up Your Book Virtual Book Tours, and was not required to give a positive review","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E0J6G8TKZB4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692396829#wasThisHelpful","R3E0J6G8TKZB4V","A456NFKWB68YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A456NFKWB68YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love historical fiction and this story sure didnât disappoint, we are in WWI and living in England. Grace Mabryâs father owns a successful teashop, and she has grown up not wanting for much, except loosing her mother at a young age. Now with the war on she wants to do her part, and her twin brother is fighting the Germans. As a prank, or to make them think, she crashes an elite society party and passes out white feathers, a sign of cowardness.When her father and Aunt get word of this fiasco she is sent to the Womanâs Forage Corps, they work crops for the horses fighting for their country. You can guess at whose estate she ends up at, yes! Jack Benningham, or aka Earl of Stonebrooke, whose property is helping the cause, and whom she gifted with her feather.What a twisted and intriguing story this is, and the pages turned so fast, I never wanted it to end. I felt I was living in this time period, and learned so much about what was going on during this era.The authorâs note at the end really shook me when she told of the famous spy Mata Hari and some relatively unknow facts.

"I loved this book.  This is one of those stories that pulled me in from the first pages and kept me reading to see what was going to happen next.  Donna Gallagher is trying to prove that her father's death wasn't an accident and Brent Mitchell is searching for his missing sister.  When they realize the cases are related  and begin to work together things begin to happen that result in a page turner that wouldn't let me put it down.

"This is another book from this author that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Her writing style and the way she portrays her characters result in pulling the reader into a story that is hard to put down once you have started it.  This story follows Jolene, a young woman that is planning her wedding and has a promising career that is called home by someone she had a past relationship with  to help care for her father who she feels she was never good enough to earn his love and acceptance.  It is a beautiful story of family reconciliation and of Jolene's discovering that God's will for her life may be completely different from her plans.

"Sound Peats is a set of Bluetooth earbuds that has volume control, forward, rewind next track, and answer a phone call. And holds the battery that goes around your neck then two ear buds go up to the ears.In this you get micro USB charging cable, instructions.I could not find how big the battery is in mah but in my test the set played for about 4.5 hours.Pairing the device to my iPhone is a piece of cake. After charging the device turn it on then turn the Bluetooth option on. Press the button as if to answer a call. My iPhone found the device in seconds. I clicked on the name of the device and it finished connecting In a minute or less I was listening to a podcast.The ear buds are VERY comfortable and comes with two other pairs of silicone ear pieces for a better fit.One thing that is cool is these are magnetic so the ear buds will stick on the end of the housing to prevent the cords from being tangled and damaged.Sound quality the sound quality is decent like Marshmallow, JVC, skull candy, etc but nowhere near the sound quality of some of the ear buds I have reviewed.This set is super comfortable and light in weight so it will not be a bother to wear them day in day out.My one and only concern is how these would react if someone wanted to wear them jogging. My question is would they bounce around and be a bother then?If you want a Bluetooth set of ear buds that gives you stereo quality sound instead of listening to your music in a single  ear this is a good option. Myself I listen to podcasts mostly so I prefer a Bluetooth device like the Tronfy, Mpow Cobble or the new inside ear device I reviewed recently. Looks like 1/2 of a yin yang symbol.If I listened to music I would gladly use these ear buds because I like to keep my iPhone in my pocket where it is less likely to be damaged","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UOT8IYBRPHN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z56JVI6#wasThisHelpful","R1UOT8IYBRPHN3","A3TMH3ESKQN3L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TMH3ESKQN3L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This device is a 42mm 1 5/8 inch cube and two of the faces have speakers, and one of the faces has buttons for power, answer a phone call, skip forward or back.This device uses a standard micro USB plug and a piece of silicone folds back up to keep water out of the USB plug so it should work great in the shower to catch up on the news answer phone calls listen to podcasts while your phone or iPod is safely outside the shower up to 30 feet away safe and dry.Pairing this device to my iPhone was a piece of cake.I have used and tested several blue tooth speakers.One of them the sound quality was so weak I could not hear the sound 5-7 feet away.Some were big and bulky like 5 inches across and weighs 6 ozs.Some have non standard charging plugs. You lose or damage the cord and your device is cooked.This tiny device is a 42mm Cube and weighs 2.45 ozs 70 grams.This device is so small and light you can drop in a pocket of Gym bag.As a test I turned on the AC and walked around the living room and could hear the device 10 feet away and the volume is only at 55-60âI love this little device.

I HIGHLY recommend these and the Tronfy. The Mpow Cobble is OK.There are two problems with the Mpow Cobble.The plastic piece that goes over the ear , and poor volume.

"This company sent me a sample for honest review.I received the device turned it on and all three lights came on as if it has a full charge.I first charged my Bluetooth earpiece for my phone and then plugged my Empty Anker 5,200 mah battery pack. When the Anker was 3/4 of the way through this device ran out of juice.I charged this battery pack for two days and the third light on the device continued to blink as if it was charging.I never had to charge a device for 48 hours before.Then I started charging my battery devices5,200 mah battery pack1,100 mah eCig battery1,700 mah for two 850 mah batteries50 mah Tronfy Bluetooth earpieceThis device was completely empty before the Bluetooth device was charged.This was only about 8030-8040 mah when the battery pack is supposed to hold 10,400 mah.So one of the following three things has happened.1. Part of the battery was left out in manufacturing.2. Part of the device has failed.3. A wire came loose in the bumpy ride it had through the mail before I received the device.The parts that works works extremely well but It is missing about 2,360 mah of the power this device is supposed to hold.I REALLY like the look of this battery pack with the aluminum housing and it weighs less than my 10,300 mah Nationite, 10,000 mah Kmashi, my 10,000 mah Anker. Why do I have 35,500 mah  in four battery packs? Simple my electronic devices are very important to me.

"I love this tank. It holds 4.5 ml of ejuice.What makes this tank so special is the organic cotton wicks. It gives a much truer taste of the ejuice than many of the other wicking materials; however this has one down side. If you like to chain vape you could burn the orgsnic cotton wick and that is NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO HAPPEN. So add a few drops of ejuict directly to the wick or wait a a few minutes for the wick to become saturated.There is a trick to help the wicks soal the ejuice faster.Take a pin or needle and pull a few fibers outside the square housing for the wick and coil.DO NOT PULL THE COTTON OUT. ALL YOU NEED IS A FEW SHORT FIBERS.Another reason I like this tank is that you can take the tank apart and change the silicone bands to another color that will match your battery of mod.The reason I love this tank is that it comes with an RDA so you can wrap your own coils and insert wicks onto the RDA platform. Since I make my own ejuice building my own coils was just the next step.I only have one nitpick. I wish the RDA housing was 1 mm wider of the screws were 1mm closer together because the tolerances in the RDA platform are super critical. Just make sure the wire doesn't touch the wall of the RDA platform.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWJ38W1MMNIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNS77TW#wasThisHelpful","R1YWJ38W1MMNIR","A3TMH3ESKQN3L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TMH3ESKQN3L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great concept for a bushcraft knife. Pitiful rendition.This knife is a cost effective copy of the Ray Mears bushcraft knife built by Alan Wood.It is said that an Alan Wood designed ""Woodlore"" knife is about $900 and sometimes the waiting list is 10 years.The Bushlore was designed to be a reasonably priced copy of the Wood Lore.Ok. So what is wrong with it?1. The knife is made of 1075 carbon steel instead of 01 tool steel.2.several lots had problems with the heat treat and tempering. My knife was ok in that dept.3. My Bushlore had a Scandi grind that looked as if it had been done by a five year old. The two grinds did not meet in the center so as soon as the edge had any abuse such as batoning or chopping the thin grind on one side of the blade was going to ROLL. The only way to fix that would have been to completely re profile the blade. these have a coating to prevent the steel from rusting when being shipped at the factory to the U.S. THE PROBLEM is that they have a BIG PROBLEM when scraping a Ferro rod.The thing that made me mad was the pitiful fit and finish with the handle scales. The wood scales did not fit properly so water and sweat could get between the wood and steel and rust the steel from within.

"I had wanted to add a comment to the other review but that option was not available for some reason.First off I have been using the prickly pear fruits every day of my life for health reasons.Chron's disease runs in my family. Grandfather, Aunt, three cousins, my brother and I. Chrons is not talked of openly at least in my family.Earlier I had read the book Prickly Pear as medicine. I recommend that book to you if you want to see how this miracle plant is being studied.PLEASE explain the wet-dreams of Knives & Fights...Then I attended a demonstration on how to process the fruit without becoming a pin cushion of thorns and the hair like glochids.If you want to learn how to process the juice; I highly recommend you visit the instructable by Joni50. This is the easiest way to process the juice.Pick the fruit with tongs.Pulverize the fruit with blender.Strain the juice through assorted mesh. Joni started with a colander. That works but slow. Start with a plastic mesh bag that oranges comes in. This gets most of the skins and seedsStage 2. T shirt material this starts removing thorns seeds and thorns most of the glochids and pectin.Stage 3 sheet or pillowcase fabric. Most sheets have 200 threads per inch and there will not be one glochid get throughNow you have the juice it is vital that you process the juice further because if you don't it will ferment to vinegar even in the Fridge at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.Some reduce it. Add corn syrup and sugar and make candy.Some make jelly by adding Sure Gel (if memory serves and sugar and make jelly so you can add a healthy addition to your diet that is rich in Betalains, fiber, etc that tastes good on your toast or English muffin.Others simply freeze the juice. Since I use some juice I reduce the juice to 1/3 of its original volume and freeze it in plastic soda, Gatorade, freezer containers, etc.After I had used the juice for a few months I noticed my pain from Chrons was better. After 18 months of using Prickly Pear juice; I am happy to say o have not needed to take pain medication since early October 2014. And to be free of the pain and medicinal side effects; it makes me very happy.Not all medicines come in a pill. God made most of the best medicines.I use the juice in Lemonade,and in my smoothies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO0V8ACGSQDSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0974841358#wasThisHelpful","RO0V8ACGSQDSD","A3TMH3ESKQN3L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TMH3ESKQN3L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a little Min Pin (Moku) with seperation anxiety. I have tried EVERYTHING to stop his howling. He sounds like 10 dogs are being tortured. In the beginning I kept expecting the humane society to leave a note on the door or force the door open.I tried the anti stress chewables, treats when he was good, and scolding when he howled. I also tried the ultrasonic egg and that helped for two days and he went back to howling. I thought about trying the collar with citronella spray; but many reviews reported the spray activating if the dog was good but just shook their body.This little dog would start howling if I just left the room to use the bathroom.Several neighbors complained of his howling so I bought this collar. The first day I put it on him I set the shock to the highest rating. I walked out the door. I heard one bark followed by screeching. I walked back in and adjusted the response down to the lowest setting and walked out again. He barked; the tone went off and he never barked again because now he knows that collar bites if he starts howling.If you have a little dog (Moku weighs 10 pounds) I highly recommend this collar.You will need to trim the collar to sice because the collar was so long Moku was standing up and the end of the collar was dragging on the floor. So adjust the collar to fit your dog and trim to length and melt the nylon with a lighter to prevent the nylon from fraying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HDT2BS2BQJ0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L31PF1Y#wasThisHelpful","R2HDT2BS2BQJ0P","A3TMH3ESKQN3L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TMH3ESKQN3L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She used it ONE TIME ACCORDING TO DIRECTIONS, and that was the end of her Scabies, and she didn't have to past $99 to get rid of them.The way you use this soap is to lather up with this soap and allow the lather to stay on your body's for 60 seconds or so and wash the lather off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REFGZYJLJ3K49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSOI73W#wasThisHelpful","REFGZYJLJ3K49","A3TMH3ESKQN3L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TMH3ESKQN3L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I LOVE enchiladas, Taco's, and other Tex-Mex foods; however living in the Tuscon Area I have yet to find a good place to satisfy my cravings.I really don't like browning hamburger because I have to use the propane stove in the RV. And then I have to deal with the grease.This Libby's Crumbles was a God send.Open a package of crumbles put some meat on a tortilla with cheese picante sauce, then put the wrapped burritos in the microwave covered with more picante sauce and melted cheese.

"this speaker has a HUGE suction cup on the bottom, and the controls are on the top of the deviceThis device does not use a standard, mini or micro USB plug. The power connection in a 1/8th inch plug like the plug for ear buds or earphone.This device cones with a rubber plug to keep the water out of the device.Another reviewer commented they had problems to pairing the speaker to the device that was playing the podcasts or music. I never experienced that at all; the pairing was extremely easy.The sound quality was good even sounding like it had deep bass boost.My one and ONLY criticism of this device is the propriety power plug (the same criticism I had for the Tronfy Bluetooth ear phone.)I HATE proprietary power plugs because power cords sometimes are misplaced or lost or ruined.I like the ability to replace power cords on Amazon, eBay, Radio Shack, or the electronics section of Wal-mart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1301Q1OXDDOVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMJVOQ2#wasThisHelpful","R1301Q1OXDDOVT","A3TMH3ESKQN3L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TMH3ESKQN3L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the only thing that really helps when I have a migraine.I have had migraines since a teenager, and I have taken all kinds of prescriptions for migraines.Many of those migraine medications left me spacey and disoriented, some make me sick and vomit, and some had me feeling as if my head was a helium balloon floating 100 feet above my body.I stumbled across this and my 3 step headache cure completely by accident.I was driving home from work and I felt a migraine coming on so I stopped in a convenience store to get something to keep the full effect of the migraine at bay until I could reach home and go to bed in a very dark room.I bought a 5 pack of these and a Coca Cola. I knew this would taste terrible so I got a Hershey bar to clear my palate from the taste.I poured the powder on my tongue and swallowed it with the help of the Coke then ate the Hershey bar.I got back on the road and finished the Coke on the way home.I got home safely and went to bed.

"Great little flashlight.This flashlight throws an incredible amount of light from one little AA batteryThe flashlight is 3 5/8x1 3/32 inches (9.4x2.7 centimeters), and weighs 3.02 ozs (85.4 grams) including the weight of the battery.The on/off switch is on the tail cap, and appears to be silicone to prevent moisture from getting in.It comes with a pocket clip.The bezel appears to be tactically minded so you can concentrate a lot of energy into a tiny point if you have to use the flashlight as an impact device.What I liked about this light is that the on/off switch is slightly recessed to help prevent accidental switching on in your pocket. You can stand the light on the tail cap so you can aim the light at the ceiling to light a room temporarily.The bezel slides in and out to focus the beam.I only have one con for this flashlight.The knurling on the anodized aluminum is very shallow so it can be slippery if your hands are wet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV82FFA0WA2RQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006E0QAFY#wasThisHelpful","RV82FFA0WA2RQ","A3TMH3ESKQN3L4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TMH3ESKQN3L4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"if you have one or more wireless devices and you are often on the go as I am; YOU NEED THIS.This device was rushed to market for the 2014 holiday season so the packaging is sort of plain.This device weighs 9.77 ozs (276 grams). The dimensions are 5 5/8x2 1/2x 1 inches (14.2x6.3x2.54 centimeters). Yes it's heavy but the footprint of this device is tiny. You can easily find room for this device in a pocket, gym bag, or attachÃ© case.My device came fully charged and I used two devices with this.1. My Samsung Android phone.2. My 5th generation 64 GB iPod touch. I make videos for YouTube, have my entire Kindle 1,700+ volume library on this, have lots of videos I acquired from iTunes. Not to mention the eight different podcasts I follow.With the original charge I charged my Samsung phone from 5% to full charge twice, and my iPod Touch from 20% or less to full four times. When the battery pack finally ran out I had charged my iPod Touch from 20% or less to 55%.The device is charged via a micro USB.On the side of the device are three normal full sized USB ports.The device comes with a cable to charge the device, and a USB Cable with three different connections on the other end.One is a micro USB.One is the 30 pin connector for the earlier iPad's and the 4th generation iPod Touch.One is the micro fire line for the 5th gen iPod Touch and the newer iPads.If you need a flashlight double click the power button and you have a little LED flashlight to find an item or enter a key into a lock.This battery Pack will hold 13,000 mah (MiliAmpHours) most smart phones hold 2,000mah-2,600mah. Some of the newer smart phones such as the latest Samsung phones have much larger batteries. My Samsung is 18-24 months old. So you do not have unrealistic expectations if you have the more recent phones.I only have two cons for this device.1. The weight.2. There is no connection for original USB or mini USB devices used by old MP3 players and the old flip phones so if you have an old device you will have to use your original cable or buy another cable.It would have been nice if they had added another cable for charging these old devices.This device stores an incredible 13,000 mah of energy, and the cost is absolutely incredible.

"Hide is part one in The Black Letter Series.It is a spin off from The Conklin's Trilogy, but can be read as a stand alone.I gave this book 5 stars.This is Mitch and Jamie's story.This book was explosive! It has everything you would want in a story. Suspense, humor, love, and HOT steamy sex scenes. From page one of this book I was hooked and couldn't stop turning the pages. I knew these characters from the previous series, but Brooke made them so fresh and new that even if you haven't read the first books you are going to love them. There is major chemistry between these two. I think it took them the longest to see it. Jamie is stubborn and would have bet her life that she was not attracted to Mitch. Mitch knew from the moment he laid his eyes on her that she was his and it was meant to be. He is funny, quirky and full of sarcastic remarks. These traits make him even more attractive. He has this way of presenting himself that makes you believe that he doesn't have a heart. That he's a stuck up play boy that does what he wants when he wants. Mitch is so not that guy. He is sweet and loving and you just have to look past the big old wall he has up. He's tired of nobody believing in him, of thinking that he is a joke. He has overcome a lot in his life and just wants to be accepted.Jamie has been through a lot as well and has a very dangerous man (stalker) that wants nothing more then to have her all to himself. She feels safe for once in her life, and then the letters start to arrive and all of that goes flying away. She is scared and always looking over her shoulder for something to happen. Mitch makes her feel safe, he gives her a sense of security that she hasn't felt EVER. This ends on a cliff hanger, but the next book should be out in a few months. I got to the end of this book and actually screamed ""NO, are you kidding me???"" I was sitting there staring into dead air thinking I didn't just read the last page.Brooke has outdown herself! She is an author that I have seen grow between book one of her first series to book one of this series. She has lept into the limelight. Watch out for her she is going places. You don't want to miss this author! I enjoyed this book even more then I enjoyed her other work, and that is saying a lot. Mitch and Jamie are one of the best couples I have read this year and I am sure will always be one of my favorites..

"Back to the Drawing Board is a side book to the Twisted Series, but this book can be read as a standalone. We meet Carter in the Twisted books first.I gave this book 5 ""Let's play a game"" Stars.Carter has been through so much in his young life. Too much for a young man to go through, but he survived and although he has many scars that he carries around, he is a better and stronger person because of all of it.  Julia is someone who has been tested in so many ways, ways she feels she has failed, but she is strong, beautiful and capable of so much more then she thinks she is. When these two meet the sparks fly, but they both have so much to go through alone to even think about being together. But that doesn't stop either of them from wanting more and thinking that this could be something that is perfect. Through all the ups and downs, ins and outs Carter and Julia are tested and shown that sometimes love is not just about loving a person. It is about living each day with them, easy or hard, and giving all that they have to each other.  About building a life together that is stronger then steel.This is a beautiful story about finding love when you're not really looking for love. About trusting someone with your heart when you feel like there isn't anyone left to trust. Fusing a bond that is unbreakable. Carter is such a beautiful bright shining star. I really hoped that I liked Julia because not anyone could be with Carter and make me happy. But LL did it! She blew it out of the park. I loved Julia so much.Don't miss this story. It is a must read! I love LL's work and look forward to reading more of her work! I am a fan for life and will read anything and everything that she writes! Thank you LL for such amazing stories told from your heart! My life would be a little darker without them in it.  <3","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U6AI7PMPSNOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NXMLWA#wasThisHelpful","R1U6AI7PMPSNOV","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BOOK 1****UPDATE*** at first I gave this book a 4.5 stars.I have changed that.. This book now gets 5 stars.Only thing I want to say is read both books before you reviewthe first. Review them as a series and not just as one book at a time.And keep an open mind. This Series will change your life if you let it.I was given this book as an ARC for an honest review.I gave this book 4.5 stars.This is the first book that I have read from this Author.This is book one in the Lost & Found Series.This is Becca, Grayson and Ray's story.OK Becca was in a bad marriage and lost her husband in the war. Now all she wants to do is raise her daughter and live her life. She does not trust men at all! She runs her B&B and is happy with all that she has.That is until she meets her employee's (and second mom's) nephew, Grayson. Grayson is an alpha male if there every was one. Now he has come to visit his Aunt and has fallen, love at first sight! He will stop at nothing to get her, and although Becca fights him at first she gives in. Then Grayson in his alpha ways does something that pushes her into the arms of her best friend Ray who has always been in love with Becca. Now that Becca knows how Ray feels what is she going to do? Is she going to go back to the impossible man Grayson or is she going to give the sweet man that would never do the things that Grayson is doing to her a chance? You will be caught by surprise in this love triangle that will leave your head spinning and wondering which way is up!!OMG! First I will tell you what I didn't like and why I only gave this story a 4.5 (rounded up:)) This book went FAST! I mean I don't think I would have time to like someone let alone love them in the time that Becca and Grayson did. I do believe in love at first sight. But I also believe that everything else happens at a slower pace. I also believe that after all that Becca has been through that she would not put up with all of Grayson's dominating ways! There is no way! I mean some of the things that he dominated were ok, but he did push it way more then he should have. But all of that put aside. I did love this story and was drawn into it from the very beginning. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. And the triangle didn't happen just like that, it just kind of happened and I did like that too, it was not like she just decided hey I want to date two men. You will be shocked at all the things that happen in this book. It is not just a love triangle. Becca has to learn to trust and love again. And sometimes that is hard when you have been through so much. Grayson is charming and wonderful and sexy as sin! Get ready for the ride of your life, hold on and don't let go. Thank you for this amazing story. I look forward to reading book two in the series. <3BOOK 2What if everything you thought wasn't the whole truth? Becca is starting to learn things once she comes back from California and what is she going to do with all this new information that she is getting? Is this going to change the way she feels for Grayson or Ray? This will change everything from what YOU  thought it was, and give you a whole new perspective on this story.Once the truth comes out and Becca starts to remember, Grayson, Ray and Becca will never be the same.As soon as I finished this book I went and bought both books!! That is how much I love this series.That is all I can give you. When I finished this book I was in a book hangover immediately. <u> I cried my eyes out and then cried some more. And I mean UGLY cried, head aching, out right sobbing, can't breath crying.</u> I could have guessed so many things that this book was doing and what really happened will leave you never the same. You will not even see it coming. I understand all the things that I complained about in this book. If there was a situation I was not happy with and wanted to skip, I am glad that I didn't.  This is the type of book that after you read the series you have to go  back and read it again with a different mind set and probably will get so much more out of it.  The Author has guts writing this. Why? Because I am sure nobody understands her writing and why she did what she was doing at the time. Until the end of the second book and then the light bulb goes off and your like oooohhhhh....So all I will say to you is give this series a chance, read it and keep an open mind and when your done with the second book then make your final opinion and leave your review.  It is hard for me to leave this review right now. There is so much that I want to say that I can't.This book is in the top for my list in 2014 and I am sure it is going to be very hard to beat. Thank you Jacquelyn for writing this and helping me fall in love with your amazing, beautiful characters. I hate to admit that your fictional characters brought out all the feels that it did for me. You are a gifted and very talented writer. I. Cannot. Wait. for book #3  !!!!!BOOK 3First off I gave this book 5 starsThis is book 3 in the Lost and Found seriesand is not a standalone. You need to read all three books.And I would suggest before you leave any reviews that you read ALL three books.This series is tied together like no other. The writing is exceptional and you will find yourself crying, laughing, and sometimes very frustrated. There might be a few things in the first book that you do not understand BUT it does come together and then you will understand all of it at the end. Book 3 was bittersweet for me. I could not wait to get my grubby little hands on this after the emotional rollercoaster that Jacquelyn left us with in book 2 but I also knew that this was the last book in this series. I have become so attached to these characters that I did not want to have to say goodbye. This is a series you will definitely want to read over, the first time you will be like HUH?? Then the second time you will be like OH! and then the third time you will be like YES! Ha ha! I cried like a baby probably the whole way through book three, I say this with my head hung in shame. This book series really affected me.I love all three of these Characters, Grayson, Ray and Becca. And in book three Becca knows who she is suppose to be with, she does everything she can to make things the way they are suppose to be. But when there is so much doubt from all the times that you weren't sure she has her work cut out for her to convince this beautiful man that this time she really does mean business.Forgetful Lucy is gone and standing there is a beautiful, shoeless woman waiting to give her life to the man she loves. Can she convince him that this time it is real?Jacquelyn shoot me now! Drag my body into the back yard and bury me. I have been left speechless (yet I am still talking) ! You have given me a book (a series) that I have never experienced before. You have left me with a broken heart that I am not sure can be put back together. I will be forever changed from this series. PLEASE give it a chance and fall in love with everything Grayson, Becca and Ray! You will not be disappointed! <3","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZRKS91JKOILP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAYUUFM#wasThisHelpful","RZRKS91JKOILP","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Book 2.1 in the Blind Vows Series.  It is book one in the new Chapter there will be book 2 and 3 very soon. It can be read as a stand alone.I gave this book 5 Holy Love Birds Batman, this book is hot!!! From the very first page I was hooked and didn't put it down. This is a short enough read you can read it in between your work break or taking care of the kids. It was sweet and loving, but also suspenseful and keep you wondering what is going to happen next.I loved these two characters and getting to know them was interesting and heart breaking. Desi and ""O"" are two souls that have been through so much in their lives and they need that special someone that they can trust and be able to share anything and everything with. I can't wait to read the second installment in the series for more of Desi and O. They are such a hot amazing couple I am not sure that JM can give us a better couple!Thank you JM for never disappointing! !  <3 I am a fan for life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HWBTGTCJSOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PHGHSU#wasThisHelpful","R23HWBTGTCJSOC","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is book 5 in the Invisibles series.I love this series and gave it 5 stars.This is Rob's story.. There is so much more to this man then meets the eye. He has been through so much and has had so much tragedy n his life like no other. He can't seem to move on and forgive himself for it all. He moves on from girl to girl and tries to get lost in the mundane of it all. That is until Paige enters his life and from that moment on neither Rob or Paige are ever going to be the same. They both see each other for what they REALLY are, and sometimes that is harder to accept then someone seeing right through you and who you're pretending to be.  There are ups and downs and in the end can they find their HEA? Or will they both be doomed to live the life they both have been living half way and full of so much sadness and heartache?Thank you Michelle for reminding me why I fell in love with this series. I wasn't sure that I was going to love Rob's book cause lets just face it with all the walls he has up, he is not very loveable. But once you give his story and him a chance that all changes.

"This is a Paranormal Fantasy Romance Anthology.It features 4 different Authors telling one story.I have never read a book written in this manner.I do have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.I gave this book 5 stars.This story was told in Seasons, each author had a season and a sister.We start with The Prophecy (Spring):Sister Aria. This story was told by Author Anne L. Parks.I loved this sister, I do believe she was my favorite. Oh, and how I loved her man, Eiden ! She was feisty and stubborn and knew what she wanted! Anne told this story very well. Kept me wanting more. I didn't want this part of the story to end. This story also told the beginning of all the things that led to why the sisters are apart.Next was Bayou Bleue (Summer): Ete' and Bear. Author Annie Rose Welch. Annie is one of my favorite authors of all time, and i just gobbled this story up. She has such a talent for giving details and really getting into the heart of the story. Not just skimming the top and giving you shallow characters. This was no different. This story took things that happened in the past and integrated them into the present. Things that happened had a huge impact on the way things were in the right now. Ete' was a bit more fiery then Aria. Aria was more laid back where Ete' was the in charge kind of gal. I loved her just as much as Aria, but again the two sisters are night and day in personality. One thing I love about this story is that these woman could do it all on their own. They're all strong enough to carry the weight that they have to, but they choose not to. In the end it does make them stronger being a unit. But these are some very strong, very amazing sisters.Connected Souls (Fall): Autumn and William's story. Author Lashell Collins. I had the hardest time connecting with Autumn. This woman I wanted to ring her neck most of the time. She never listened and she did what SHE wanted to do, at first I thought she was only out for herself and how things would turn out for HER. But she isn't like that at all. Stubborn, and pig headed yes. She is set in her ways. I think this sister might be the one that has lost the most out of all of them. But she stays strong and continues to live her life. She easily became a favorite as I read her story. This story brought me the most sadness. I didn't like the way Autumn's life had played out for her.Cold Awakenings (Winter): Wynter I was so excited to read this story. Author Dina Haynes. Wyn doesn't need a man. Although she does have one. She thinks she is weak, she thinks she can't do the things that the other sisters can do, but she couldn't be more wrong. She is one of the strongest ones. She feels the weakest and she lets that hold her back. But once she realizes she can do anything. Watch out!!She has a strong sense of protecting everyone that she loves. A strong family bond.This story was amazing, I loved every part of it. It flowed well and had me wanting more. I am very impressed that 4 authors can come together and tell a story that was so well put together and connected the way that it did. Thank you! I am so excited to read these authors other books! They're all amazingly talented woman. Thank you for a great story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26AFWF57P9NDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVXEKF2#wasThisHelpful","R26AFWF57P9NDP","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book #5 in the Saving Angels series. It is the final book.This is Gabriel's story. THIS IS NOT A STANDALONE.This review will not do this series justice. It became a real part of me over time and it is bittersweet to say goodbye to such a wonderful story. This is a story that you will be able to read throughout the years over and over again and each time you read it get something new from them. A beautiful love story that stands the test of time!SNIFF** It can't be over! :(The story ended in book 4, but did it really?Gabriel didn't think so. He had so much more to say.So Sparrow Way was born. It is a journey through a life time of memories of happy and sad moments in Eva and Gabriel's life together.This was so much more then a story. Gabriel tells his story in such a way that it grabs a hold of you and you're sucked right in there with him in those moments that meant so much to him.This book was poetic. It had moments where I had to just stop and not read another word because I was so overwhelmed with how this story was being told. I never wanted it to end. Sadly it did.It is a story that I will tell you ahead of time that you need to sit in a room alone, with no distractions to be able to really enjoy this journey.Gabriel gives you so many different angles to this story.This is definitely a meat and potatoes story. I look at a story this way- Dessert !! You love dessert, you are never disappointed in dessert. When has dessert ever let you down? NEVER! We seem to over look the real meal just so we can finish and get to our favorite part. Everyone takes for granted the meat and the potatoes! This story has bite to it, it fills you up and leaves you wanting more even when you're beyond full. Dessert? What dessert? After this story I don't need dessert! It gave me everything thing that I wanted and MORE! Well, I should say that Gabriel really is dessert all by himself ! LOL  ;)You will die of a sweet tooth reading some of his words! You will laugh, you might even cry. These two characters are off the charts compatible.One final thing--This author is beyond talent. She takes mere words and makes them into music for your soul. She tells a story like very few can. I put her right up there with the best of the authors that I have had the pleasure of reading. I will be a fan for life. She can write my grocery list any time! Thank you for the chance to read this beautiful, amazing, at times heart wrenching story.  It has touched not just my heart, but also my soul. That does sound a little over the top. BUT it is -- truth! From the very beginning this series was phenomenal and it just seemed to get better and better with each book! You do NOT want to miss it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF9TPHMX99VXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNF4AHY#wasThisHelpful","RF9TPHMX99VXJ","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Contrite.I gave this book 5 spectacular stars!This is Clove and Turner's story.What happens when the man you married comes back from a trip and doesn't feel the same as when he left? Clove finds out. This story will keep you on the edge of your seat with every turn of the page. You will feel the anxiety Clove feels. This is a spectacular story !! I couldn't put it down.This is a cliffhanger. I could feel it right from about 40% that there was going to be a second book!

"This is book two in the Star SeriesThis book can be read as a standalone.Each book is based on a different couple, but they do tie together as well.I gave this book 5 stars.This is Hannah and Royce's story.M Stratton has done it again. Another wonderful, beautiful story continues in this series.This series is a light hearted, sweet, romantic read.Hannah and Royce's story is not different.From the start I was hooked and couldn't put it down.Hannah is Liss' assistant, and Royce is Will's best friend.You still get to see Liss and Will in this book and that made me happy. I loved those two in book one. BUT this is a whole different story that is based off of Hannah and Royce.These two were simply meant to be. I also loved how there characters developed throughout the book. Very strong characters that became even better together.You don't want to miss this book.

"This is book one in the Star Series.This series can be read as a standalone, they are based on different couples, but recommend you read all of them because they are tied together.I gave this book 5 stars.This is Lissa and Will's story.I really enjoyed this book. It shows a softer side to M. Stratton and her writing.This is a sweet, funny loving romance. It doesn't focus on the sex, I did love that about this book.Will is amazing and caring man who is perfect for Lissa. If you're wanting a read that will make you feel light hearted when  you're done, this is the book. Don't miss it.I was immediately drawn into this book right from the beginning.These two have a chemistry about them that will set your heart on fire and leave you wanting more. I felt the giddiness of how Liss felt when she first laid eyes on this man. The way her heart fluttered and she was left speechless. Yeah, this is my kind of story I thought. The characters are very well developed and I was over all very happy with how this story was wrapped up. Thank you for an amazing read!

It is full of hot sexual moments and funny antics.Devil man do you gotta love this man. He is smart, sexy and so lovable. I wanted to kill Molly at times, but she did things the only way she knew how to ""all in"" which leaves her amazing husband on the side lines to watch..

Years later Kenzy is checking off her life like a checklist and finally figures out it's not the way she thought it should be. She goes back home and this is where she runs into Maverick once again. This is a sweet loving story about second chances. Second chances when you didn't think you even had a first chance. It was a wonderful story of love.

"Savage.I gave this book 5 stars.This is Nina and Kevin's story.I did not read the synopsis on this book. I am a fan of Jade's and love her work. It really doesn't matter what she writes, I read it. That being said she has reached a whole new level with her writing. She has many different styles and you can't put this author in a box. This proves the point.This is a story about the Zombie Apocalypse. I haven't read very many zombie books, but I liked the twist that she put on this.Right from the start I could relate to Nina, I haven't read very many books where the couples where a little older like in this situation, but I have to say that I loved it.  At times I wondered if the Author was speaking about my life.  The book is VERY detailed and gives you lots of information from the past and the present, but that isn't distracting and I found the details to be exactly what the book needed. Kevin is as dreamy as they come, he is mysterious and down right loveable. Who wouldn't want him in their corner.  This is a second chance romance with a twist (zombie's) a story of survival, in more then just the physical sense. It is survival of your life, your mind, and your soul.I couldn't put this book down, I wanted to know what was going to happen from one moment to the next. It is a very captivating book. I honestly would have like things to be tied up in a beautiful little bow more, but that is just me. I do hope that there will be another book so that we can see all that happens.I cannot wait to read what Jade has coming up next. She is always so full of surprises. Thank you for an amazing book that I probably would not have read if it wasn't for who this book was by, I think maybe I need to step outside the box a little more and see what is out there:)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRKJZROECR32Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF8CLC6#wasThisHelpful","RRKJZROECR32Y","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It felt like it.. AND LK did not disappoint..The last book left us with a huge cliff hanger and a big decision for Arion to make.. It doesn't matter what decision she makes someone is going to get hurt. . . She is going to have to decide what she wants to do and when she does she has to make sure without a doubt that she is making the right decision. Can she do that?This is all I was waiting for and more.. I really love this series and this is one that you do not want to miss.. It is hard to tell you any details without giving anything away..

"This is Kalli and Xavier's book.I gave this book 5 stars. It is book #4 in the Explosive series and can be read as a standalone, but almost all of the side characters are in the other books as well..These two together set the pages on fire! Tessa saved the best for last I would say!! She hit it out of the park with this one.  Tessa has been in love with Xavier since she was 16 years old, and Xavier has had those feelings for her too, but she is his best friends little sister and he promised never to go there. But as this story is told it gets harder and harder for him not to do what he promised he wouldn't do. It takes him some time to figure out that there is no running from this girl and once he does watch out!! It explodes into even more chemistry between these two .. Xavier is an alpha male and Kalli is a patient and loving person that is willing to do anything for him and his beautiful daughter Lily.. Things happen and situations arise where she is going to have to prove just that and Xavier is going to have to step up and realize that his love that he feels for this woman is never going to go away..Like I said once again Tessa has done it.. I love reading this series and this one was not a disappointment. I do believe it is my favorite of hers by far. Thank you Tessa for an amazing love story. I look forward to reading more from you in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8J1L54B5JPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SO2W4GY#wasThisHelpful","R2K8J1L54B5JPI","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Book Worms review and review was left by Melissa a Book Worms Reviewer. Thank you MelissaShe gave this book 4 starsWith little money, almost homeless, and a joke of a job what's a girl to do? Zoey Carson was about to start her dream job as a junior high counselor when she got notified that she was being evicited because of her landlord selling her building. Now what, after her best friend and husbands end up not having room for her she does the only thing she can. She accepts the offer to move into an apartment at the one man she threw herself at and got brutally shut down. Tanner Keegan has had a crush on Zoey for years, but after not wanting to get involved he let her down, not so nicely. Now that he has her under his roof, he's going to change that. With his brothers, Dalton and Clint's returns after years apart, it seems he has some competition. What starts out as a crush between one brother and Zoey turns into maybe not being able to live without anyone? Can they make it work or will it all be too much.My side....I didn't read the first one, so I didn't really get to know the characters, but I will say that I liked this story. Poor Zoey, just when she thinks her life is great, everything happens to bring her down. Her mother steals her money, her landlord sells her building, and her dream job is anything but. I felt really bad for her, but she was a strong character which I love and even after she moved in, she kept her spirit around Tanner. I don't usually read multiple partners, but this had a great storyline and I enjoyed the characters. I could feel the connection between all four of them without it being creepy. I liked how all the brothers were independent but had brotherly ties. This is a hot, steamy and sexy story  rolled up in three smokin' brothers and a feisty lady, that will make you smile and laugh with her and lust after some yummy cowboys. For my first time reading Lori King I enjoyed it and look forward to reading the next book in this series.Please note that there was not any kind of anything between the brothers. Phew because I wouldn't be giving this book a 4 star review if their was.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SMIB6H0E9C2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T210IXW#wasThisHelpful","R2SMIB6H0E9C2W","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brooke has done it again!!!She just gets better and betterthis is book two in the Conklin's Triolgy Series and cannot be read as a stand alone.Get on over to book one and read that one first!!!Boook #1This is the first book that I have read from this Author.I gave this book 5 stars.This is Becca and Tyler's story.Becca is a beautiful young lady, who has basically been put down her whole life from her family to her friends. She thinks she is fat, and ugly and not worthy of being with anyone. Her mom is always telling her how she needs to eat less, and how she will never be a size 2 but she needs to be better. Now Becca is only a size 8 to start with and once she decides to cut out all potatoes and junk food and basically anything that is not a vegetable or meat she goes down to a size 4, but she is still feeling like she is ugly and is way more comfortable in a six. Now you may say really? A size 8? I would kill to be a size 8, but society has made it so that we are not comfortable in our own skin, this was a big issue for the writer to write about, so many times we get caught up in what we think others should think, and we are never happy with ourselves.Becca has a boyfriend named Connor who she has been dating for quite awhile, that is until she finds him in her bed with her best friend Ashlynn. Ashlynn always wants everything that Becca has, and she didn't stop at the boyfriend either. She continues through out the book trying to trump Becca every chance she gets. Becca is a very passive, timid woman, and to a point that is good, but I think she is this way because everyone is always saying something about her weight, Ashlynn is always pointing it out right along with her mom, you shouldn't eat that, or it's ok that your not a size 2.Becca broke my heart, she so wants to just be loved, for who she is, that she doesn't even love herself. She is constantly trying to make herself better, She needs to learn to love herself, or she is never going to ever be happy.She graduates from college and moves in with her other bestfriend Jamie and she decides she is just going to have fun and sleeps around with a whole bunch of guys they meet at bars. She finally lands a job back home and moves back. She has a beautiful condo that her parents set up for her, and she is not happy with the fact that she is home and under their thumb once again, she wants to be able to do this on her own. But again Becca is timid and doesn't like to cause waves so she stays quiet.At her new job she meets Tyler and he is the bosses son, he runs the company with his dad and two brothers, now Tyler has his own issues and those issues cause him to want to keep her a secret, and not because of the way she thinks, she thinks it's because she is not perfect and that she is no way good enough for him, but they have to learn to deal with these things together, and both of them are very hard to get to open up, so while she thinks she is not good enough, and that she is fat and frumpy. Tyler is not like that, he loves the way she looks, and doesn't have issues with any of that.The book continues to deal with Tyler and Becca's relationship and their issues, but is this going to tear them apart? Someone with all the issues that Becca has can she put up with being a secret and if she does for how long?This book really spoke to me, maybe because I related to it so well, I found Becca to be a beautiful woman with some major issues, I do believe that Tyler can help her face some of her fears, and that he will help bring out that feistyness that she is missing. AND it is there. She just has to be willing to let it out.Tyler when he finally told his story my heart broke too, these are two beautiful, damaged souls looking for someone to just love them. And I do believe they have found that in each other.I loved going on this journey with them, and their story is not over, but their was not a major cliff hanger, which I loved also, it left me wanting more, but I was also satisfied.Thank you Brooke for a beautiful story, about learning to love yourself, about learning that you might not always be perfect but in someone's eyes they will see you as perfect! And isn't that what we are all looking for ?I can't wait to read the next book!! <3Book #2The story continues and will leave you wanting more and cheering for the heroine more then you did in the first book.I didn't think that I could like this book better then I did the first one, but Brooke proved me wrong.I cannot wait to read the final book in this series to see what is going to happen..I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good romance, a swoon worthy man, and a strong heroine.You will get everything you wanted all in one book.Thanks Brooke for a great read! <3BOOK #3reading now will leave review when i am finished","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLJOIZFFMNLJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SNNZ9N4#wasThisHelpful","RLJOIZFFMNLJK","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book one in the Absolute Series.This is Phoebe's story.I gave this book 5 stars.What happens when you lose one of the most important people in your life. A parent. Well Phoebe finds out, she is never the same and pushes her perfect life that she thought she had away. Her husband Justin does whatever he can to hang on to the love of his life. When secrets come out will they help her or will they push her further into the hole that she has created for herself?This was a touching, loving story. It pulled at my heart because i have lost my mother also.  Phoebe is a very strong character that just had her life turned upside down by life, and that would change anyone. I loved Justin and how loving and understanding he was. This is a story that will stay with you long after you have read it. It will grab a hold and not let you go. It is a page turner.

"This is book two in the Carnage series.This book cannot be read as a standalone, I feel it would just take too much from the book.This is the continuing story of Georgia's life.The first book in this series gutted me. I cried and cried and the story stayed with me long after I finished it! Weeks!! I would find myself day dreaming about the book and then be like ""NOT REAL"" ""Get a grip"", I was so afraid to start book two and I read this one a lot slower then I read the first book. Lesley Jones has done it once again. I loved this story just as much as the first.  Both stories focus on the life and loves of Georgia, what she goes through and how she deals with the things that happen to her. Sometimes she doesn't handle things the way others would, but in the end she grows and she learns from her mistakes and the things that have happened to her. The scars run deep and there is only one person that would ever be able to handle the things that she has been through..This is a very complex story and would be very hard to give you very many details without giving the story away. BUT I would like to say that Georgia makes some decisions and some of the things she does that will have you wondering what the heck is going on in her head, but they all fit together and in the end they make her who she is.Join Georgia as she fights her way through her life. As she learns that sometimes life does give you a second chance to get it right, and in the end your life might not be where you thought you would be, but it's a great life none the less. A life you wouldn't give up for anything.This story did somewhat heal my heart. This is a story that will stay with you long after you're done reading it. It will grab a hold of you and it will not let you go. It is not a beautiful HEA story. It is full of pain, drugs, sex and mistakes. It is not picture perfect, you need to have a very open mind when you read Georgia's story.

"This is book 2 in the series.Book Worms gave this book 5 stars.This book review was left by Naomi Connor a Book Worms Reviewer, Thank you Naomi.Fantastic 2nd bookâ¦If im honest I loved this one more than Intentional, maybe because it was Cades book.Cade is still trying to come to terms with loosing Mattie, he has taken time out of doing both jobs and is drinking away his days. Laurel loves his music and it doesnât hurt that he is easy on the eye either she wants to sign them. Their first meeting doesnât go to plan and there is a huge misunderstanding which leads to Cade having to apologize the following day which then leads to THE EXPEREMENT and THE DEAL.Looking forward to book 3","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1COYZ9DTLZ28D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KIVZP6U#wasThisHelpful","R1COYZ9DTLZ28D","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book two in the Destroy Series.I gave this book 5 stars.This is Kate and Reeds story.This can be read as a stand alone.KD has done it again. I have to say that she has done it better then the first one.. The characters in this story just seemed to flow a little bit better then they did in the first story. You can see the growth from the author and her writing.  I loved getting to know Kate and Reed and the things that they had to go through. This is a wonderful series that you don't want to miss. Kate is a very strong heroine and Reed is just yummy!!!I can't wait to read book three. Thank you KD for a wonderful story that kept me wanting more right up to the end. It was full of romance and suspense. You do get to meet these two in book one so i recommend that you read book one, but as stated it is a stand alone book.

"This is book one in the Destroy Series.I gave this book 4.5 stars.This is Becca and Aiden's story.Becca and Aiden both have their work cut out for them. They are both going through things that make their lives complicated. Becca from her past and Aiden from being with someone that he doesn't want to really be with. When these two meet it is instant chemistry and the sparks fly, but it it's going to be very difficult to overcome the things that they are going through. It's hard enough doing it alone, but trying to do it together is a whole other story.This story kept me interested and wanting more, and was very well written.

"SeverI gave this book 4 stars.This is Syn and Damian's story.This story is told in back and forth increments of past and present.I didn't think that I would like that, but it worked well for this story.Things didn't work out for Syn in her past, but she might have a chance to change that for her future. This story was captivating and kept me turning the pages right up to the very end of the story. I really like both of these characters and they worked so well together.  This is the first book that I have read from JM but will be reading more of her work in the future.This book was very different from other books that i have read and reviewed and is very hard to explain without giving a lot of what will happen away. But it is a story about second chances, and a story of suspense and on the edge of your seat what is going to happen next moments.. I would recommend this book to any one looking for something just a little bit different and out of the ordinary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173FMCWZVZI4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SQMY8DO#wasThisHelpful","R173FMCWZVZI4S","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I hurt so bad and knew it was going to get worse as soon as I read the words The End.  I cried and cried ( I AM NOT A CRIER)I felt pain, sadness and loss. This story is beautiful, it is real and it is tragic.  I was captured from the moment I started the book and didn't let go, even long after that last page was read. I am so scared to read the next book. I want so much for George.  Come on this journey that you will soon not forget. Share George's life with her and experience her love first hand, her loss, and her strength. You will never be the same.

Kimberly has no choice but to hire the 2 best lawyers in Louisianna to clear her name and stop her from loosing everything BUT she cant afford their fee or so she thought.They come to a business arrangement that takes them all on an emotional rollercoaster ride, are they playing a dangerous game ?I can completely understand why Kimberley felt the way she did about both men.

"This is book two in the Shelter Me Series and can be read as a stand alone.This is Adam's and Erin's story.I gave this book 5 stars.Erin has been through so much and the violence in her life that she has endured has left her closed off and afraid to let anyone in. Adam feels such an attraction and connection with Erin and wants to stop at nothing to prove to her that not everyone is the same. He will have his work cut out for him, because even if Erin does want to give him a chance her mind has other ideas. It will not be easy for him to prove to Erin that he will change her life forever if she will just let him.This was a beautiful story. That has issues that are not comfortable for everyone, but they are issues that do need to be talked about. The author handled these issues with great taste and care.

The chemistry between these two is off the charts. It will keep you wanting more right up to the last page.Scout has a strong dislike for Gable, but that is because she is so damn attracted to him. She just can't shake it. Gable can't not want her. He will do whatever it takes to get her. These two will have you at the edge of your seat with their chemistry and you will laugh and you will be a little broken hearted. This story has a little bit of it all.

"Nicole is by far one of my favorite Indie Authors.She just has a way of telling a story, of drawing you in and leavingyou hanging right up until the end of the story.This book was amazing and kept me wanting more up until the very end. The Characters are captivating and will find their way into your heart right from the beginning. Mia, Phoneix and Tarik; these three together are going to set your kindle on fire.Nicole takes her time in this full length novel for you to learn about each one of these characters. You get to know them not just on an individual level, but also together, the three of them as a unit. I am not one who really reads books with more then two people, but as I stated before Nicole has a way of drawing you in and she gets you to read things that you never thought you would, AND enjoy them.I love how they just kept bumping into each other and the thoughts of the things that they wanted to do to each other even before anything happened. It builds you up, and builds you up, and never lets you fall.I gave this book 5 stars.I will continue to be a major fan of Nicole's and can't wait to see what she comes up with next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NU9T0RLT4T4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW9JNE6#wasThisHelpful","R1NU9T0RLT4T4X","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book 2 in the Southern Boys Series.It can be read as a stand alone, but you do meet both maincharacters in book one and learn a lot about them.I gave this book 5 stars.This is Gavin and Maria's story.Gavin has been damaged by his Wife soon to be Ex-Wife to a point where he trust NO ONE. Maria knows this, but yet she falls for him anyway. She was warned to be careful and that what they had was just for fun. But sometimes the heart doesn't listen.  Gavin has so many ghosts that he has to deal with before he can be whole once again. Maria has been hurt from her family over and over again, and she has some major daddy issues so when she is dealing with everyday life these do come into play. How can two people that have been hurt so deeply, both in very different ways learn to trust again?I really loved this book.. I like when I read the first book in a series and I get nervous that I am not going to like the second book as much as I did the first, but when I read this book I fell in love with these two characters just as much as the first ones. I am not sure that I could pick a favorite if I had to. This author is very talented and this is a great series. It def is a must read.It is a story about second chances, learning to trust, learning to love and learning to give all of yourself to someone when you thought you had nothing left to give. It is about love in many different forms. You will be captivated and not be able to put this book down. Thank you CA for another wonderful novel in this series.

"This is book one in the Pine Harbour series.I gave this book 4.5 stars.I took half a star away because of how the book ended.To me it needed just a little bit more, reasoning is that something happened and just bam the book ends. Yes there is a book two but it doesn't take off where the first book ends, it is a different couple and although the first couple is in the second book it isn't as personal or connecting as it was in the first book. I was left feeling very unsatisfied :( and that bothered me because this was a very well written book .. I loved this book and the authors style of writing. I was hoping I was wrong so I read book two before I left this review. Book two was amazing and deserves 5 stars hands down. BUT don't let that defer you from reading this book. It was amazing and I did read through the other reviews and it seems I might be the only one that had a problem with the way this book ended.This is Rafe and Olivia's story.Six years. Two break ups. One divorce. They should be over each other.This is a second chance romance.Rafe married Olivia when they were very young and according to Olivia his priorities were all mixed up. That led to their divorce. But that didn't lead to the end of their love. Both of them are misunderstood and have a lot of growing up to do. They continue to feel so much love for each other, but I do believe that they have grown since they have been apart. They realize the depth of their love and realize that there has to be sacrifice in love on both sides. You get to see some of their past but also you get to go on the journey of them rediscovering each other. Their friends go through some things that make them realize that life is short and life doesn't wait for everyone to finally figure out things.Thank you Zoe for sharing your amazing story with us..

"I gave this book 5 stars.This is Tala and Adrian's book.Tala is a woman who has had many things happen to her in life. They have not destroyed her they have made her stronger. She has walls up, but they are there for a reason.  She has a huge heart and would do anything thing for you if you're in her inner circle.Adrian is used to getting what he wants, whatever he wants whenever he wants. He wants Tala.When they first meet she is stunned by how gorgeous he is, not knowing that he wants to get to know her. Right off you get to see how strong willed and determined she is, how much she loves the people she calls family..Right from the start I thought she needed someone as domineering as Adrian in her life, Tala is a fixer and she tries to help everyone in her life. She doesn't stop to think of herself at all. She fixes and fixes and fixes. I think it keeps her sane that she seems to be in charge of everyone. BUT when it comes down to her who is going to take care of her? That is where Adrian comes in and that seems all he wants to do is take care of her. She doesn't fight him. At times she wonders if he is a little psycho, but for the most part I think she really enjoys being controlled by him, and I think it is because she needs to let go of the control in her life to someone. She is scared, but she learns to trust him and give him a big piece of her heart. BUT when a woman meets a man that is used to getting everything and anything that he wants what will she do when she finds out that she is one of those things that he just wont take no for an answer?This book was amazing, I have been in a funk for a few weeks and was starting to worry that I wouldn't enjoy anything for a long time. BUT I devoured this book in about 6 hrs and it's not a short book. I was mesmerized by this couple and loved them from the very beginning .. There are some people that were in Adrian's life that I just wanted to smack but Tala does a good job of taking care of things that get out of hand..

"This is book two in The GEG Series.I gave this book 5 stars.It is a standalone BUT I really suggest that you read the first book.Both of the main Characters in this book are in book one also.This is CiCi's and Kyle's story.This book would have rocked without Kyle. Just sayin'! Yes, Kyle is hot and sexy and just a wow kind of guy. BUT CiCi is a one of a kind woman. She is full of fire and just waiting to explode on anyone and everyone. She says what she feels when she feels it. It is a what you see is what you get with her.She is strong, she is someone who can handle the world, but inside she is a beautiful soul. A soul that needs healing. A soul that needs loved.We all have a friend like this. NO, I guess we don't I would LOVE to have a friend like this. She is so full of spunk and knows what she wants out of life. She doesn't take no for an answer, and she goes for it. The sad thing is CiCi has been hurt. She has been crushed. How? Why? When? She keeps all of that to herself. (even from her reader). She really doesn't trust anyone and doesn't believe in love at all. Her walls are just as thick as they are high. She refuses to let anyone in, but her Best friends and her sister. The GEG's are a group of girls that are the best of friends and they say anything and everything whenever they feel like it. I was busting a gut at 2% into this book. At 22% I was pledging my undying love to the author! I needed this book!! This story was phenomenal to me. I loved every part of it. CiCi made it!Now lets get to Kyle. Kyle is gorgeous and sweet and an all around good guy. CiCi doesn't do good guys. But she can't fight this attraction that she is feeling towards him. This magnetic pull, and the fact that no matter what she says Kyle is not giving up. It is annoying her to a point. BUT it is also showing her that some people are worth giving a second chance to. CiCi has to learn that yes love sucks and sometimes people make mistakes, but not everyone is going to crush you. Sometimes two people are meant to be together. Feel the pull. Kyle feels the pull to her from the moment she says hello to him. He just knows that CiCi is THE girl. He is convinced that she is the one. Kyle doesn't take no very well, and let me tell you she says no many, many times. Kyle tries to find ways upon ways of showing CiCi that he is here to stay. Kyle loves her sassy attitude and doesn't try to change her. She can be a bit abrasive and he just takes it and shows her that that is something that he loves about her.This story is about first love, second chances, and broken hearts. It is about life. It is about saying yes you're worth giving a chance to, and sometimes things do work out. This story made me laugh, it made me cry, made me laugh some more. It made me believe that sometimes love is beautiful ... The end of this book made me jump with joy. CiCi heals her heart, and she learns to love with all of herself again. YAY!!!BUT this is not the end of the GEG's!!! I cannot wait to read what Jacquelyn has coming up next!! I am sure it is going to be spectacular, but this one is going to be very hard to beat. I loved the first book, but this one by far was my favorite! Cici is my inner child!! LOL.. I wish. Thank you Jacquelyn for books that I will never forget. You just keep surprising me !! This is an author that you need to keep an eye on! She is headed for bigger and better things!!! <3","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24PAHSQ6R9GB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7FXRQQ#wasThisHelpful","R24PAHSQ6R9GB4","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is book two in A Gateway to Love Series.This book can be read as a standalone, but does have the same characters in this book as the first one, they are just centered around a new couple. I would suggest reading the first book and then reading this one. It will be a lot more enjoyable.I gave this book 5 stars.This is Wyatt and Jenna's story.This story is so different from Three Rivers. This book is more centered around sports and the love of the game. If you love football and a love story you're going to LOVE this book. Being a football fan I fell right into the story line. Even if you're not a fan of football you will love this book. It will grab you and suck you right in so be fair warned. I started this book and never set it down. My eyes were burning and I just kept saying I will just read one more chapter. LOL Yeah it is def one of those books.Chloe's books seem to grab you and do something to you. This book started right off with tugging at your heart, it gives you a glimpse into Jenna's life when she was younger and why she has all the walls up that she does. Those walls are high, and Wyatt has a huge job ahead of him, and although he starts off not being the most honest man about why he wants involved with Jenna he quickly falls for the blonde, blue eyed beauty. So much that if she ever found out his secret and he lost her it would probably destroy him. Jenna refuses to let anyone in that she can't control. She has had so much loss in her life that she would rather be alone then deal with someone else leaving her. She is sometimes so blunt that it comes off as her being a little B**ch. But Jenna is far from that, she is such a beautiful soul that just needs some love and some reassurance that she is worthy of being loved. She is so scared that she is going to lose everything that she never even gives it a try.Not only will you love Wyatt and Jenna. You will love these side characters too. You get to see the old gang from the first book and fall even more in love with them. I cannot wait to read Aubrey's story this girl is wild and full of fire! I just know it is going to be an exciting book. This woman is so full of spunk you don't know whether to love her or smack her at times. She is something else.. You get more of Tea, Griffen and Johnny. You meet new characters and fall in love with them too.I want to also say this is a love story about friends too. The best of friends. The unstoppable threesome . . These three woman or so tightly nit. They finish each others sentences and give a new meaning to friendship. They help each other and lean on each other when the going gets tough. So not only do you get a love story about two beautiful people, you also get one about three amazing friends as well.This gives you a glimpse into the life of two people who have been hurt for different reasons in their life. It shows you what each one of them has to do to let the other one in. It shows you what can happen when you trust the wrong people and let them control the things that you do. It will have you laughing, smiling, crying and everything in between. This book is about love and second chances. It is about wanting more out of life and taking the risk no matter what the consequences. Give this series a shot you won't be sorry! Chloe has scored another touchdown once again!!! I cannot wait to read the next book in this series.. When I found out who was up next I did a happy dance!!!!! Thank you Chloe for another fantastic book!! You rock !!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12J8GDP9CW6HI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8H9EB6#wasThisHelpful","R12J8GDP9CW6HI","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was bittersweet for me.This is book 5 in the Bayou Stix series.All of the books in the series can be read as a stand alone, BUT I would not read this one as a stand alone. The one and only epilogue you will find in Skye's books is in this book and it is a spoiler alert!!!I recommend to get the full affect that you read ALL of the books from the beginning. It just isn't the same when you read them out of order .. You will miss so much.This is Cruz and Tifanie's book. I felt like Cruz was the most troubled  of the group, but that might be just because I connected with him on a deeper level.  I wanted to ring this guys neck at times and say wake up and OPEN those eyes!!! When bad things happen to you in your life you tend to think that you are not worthy of any love, any affection, anything period. Cruz is no exception. Cruz is fine on his own, he feels like he is too damaged for anyone to love. He barely can stand the site of himself.  I really think he feels lucky to have the people that he does in his life and he is happy with that. That is until Tifanie comes sauntering in. She is a fire ball, a force to be reckoned with. She will not take no for an answer. She is willing to show Cruz just what he is worth and more. She won't give up and she is willing to stay around for the long haul. BUT Cruz has other plans. Can Tifanie convince him that she is worth it? That they are worth it?This book is a page turner right from the beginning and never slows down.  These two together are smoking hot, just like all of Skye's other characters. She sure knows how to find the perfect matches. I do love how Cruz had to deal with Cruz before he could even realize that he should be with Tifanie. There were so many sad situations where I just wanted to take this man and cuddle up with him and tell him everything would be okay. The things that Cruz has been through would have broken anyone else. He is weak and he is scarred, but he is strong and he is beautiful. He just has to find his purpose, his reason. Cruz is a beautiful tortured soul.  Tifanie is just the one who said I am not giving up on you. I see inside and I love what I see and I will spend my whole life showing you that it is beautiful.You don't want to miss this book. As I stated it was bittersweet for me. I had to say goodbye to my Bayou Stix crew. The ending will have you cheering and shedding a few tears. I am so sad to read the last book in this series, but I look forward to reading more from this talented author. She has a fan for life. Thank you Skye for this spectacular series. You get a little bit of everything in these books. You will be able to relate to at least one or more of the books.

The moment she lays eyes on him, sheâs in trouble.Both Tyke and Francine know a relationship between them would be a disaster, but with each session, things continue to heat up, making it impossible to deny the connection they share. Boundaries cross, attractions heighten and both of their willpowers will be tested to the very limit.Novel centers around Tyke Douglas, bassist of Black Falcon, and is final book in the series.This was bittersweet for me. I love this series. These boys have become part of my heart. I couldn't wait to read Tyke's story but knowing this was the last one in the series broke my heart.I gave this book 5 stars.This series deserves so much more then just 5 stars.It can be read as a stand alone but why would you want to do that!!?This is Tyke's story. Tyke is the last of the guys to get hitched and he is feeling it. He is tired of holding this band together. That is how he feels. That he is the only one doing anything. The other guys are all caught up in their relationships with their woman. Tyke resents that. Even his twin has lost his mind. So Tyke decides to do his own thing. His own thing gets out of hand and he ends up having to go into rehab to get it under control. This is where he meets the beautiful doctor Francine. She has her own problems and is dealing with her own losses. Both of them know that their relationship is against the rules, it is a disaster waiting to happen. But they feel that pull, that pull that is telling them that fate has other plans for them.  What will they do will they give in? And if they do will they be able to handle all the repercussions of having a relationship that was doomed from the start!?I LOVED this book. It was my favorite by far. Only thing I didn't like was I knew it was the last book. Tyke is feisty and pigheaded and knows what he wants, he is sexy and beautiful on the inside and such a sensitive soul. He was so hurt by the things that were going on in the band and just went about it the wrong way to let the others know how he was feeling. He finally gets to open up and really get to know about himself when he is talking to Francine. Now the chemistry was there before he even met her but once he started to talk to her and get to know her the attraction just grew.. But she is also someone who brings out the best in him, makes him see his strong side and who he really is.. And shows him how to communicate.You don't want to miss this book!! It kept me laughing and smiling the whole time.. I felt his frustration at times .. Michelle has a way of pulling you into her world!! I can't wait to read more from her.. She is on my must read list!!!!IN fact this whole series is a must read! Don't miss out if you love rockers and bad boys with beautiful souls. Then YOU DON't want to miss this series!! Get it now!!! Thank you Michelle for completing this beautiful, amazing series with this spectacular book!!! These boys will forever be a part of my heart!!! <3 **Cries eyes out**","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCEMXTCCWNJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NS4QA0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1VCEMXTCCWNJR","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is Kory and Stone's story.I gave this book 5 stars.First off Jade is one of my most favorite Authors, I read all that she has out and eat it up like it was the best thing that ever happened. This story did not disappoint. Jade has many different sides to her story telling and you never know what to expect. I loved this book from the very first paragraph and fell more in love with these two characters as the story continued to progress.Kory is young. She falls for Stone, a tattoo and piercing artist. When she finally gets up the nerve to get to know him, that is when the sparks start to fly. He tries to deny her because she is a lot younger then him, but soon the way they both feel takes over and they have to learn to deal with the fact that they are in each others lives for the long haul. Both have baggage. Stone feels like his will be a deal breaker, where Kory is more afraid that she won't be able to let Stone in the way she should. She shares her demons easier then Stone does, but that is a man for you. They have obstacles that they have to get through, and a lot of eye opening situations, but when it all comes down to it life always has a way of working out, fate comes in and gives you what you deserved even if you had to wait a long time to get it. Thanks Jade for another amazing book by you.

"Tabatha and Dash's story.This is a 5 star read for me.It is the first book in the series & is a novella.I love Shantel's stories and jumped at the chance to read this. Dash is a take risk doesn't matter the consequences kind of guy.  When he is offered an opportunity of a lifetime he jumps at it. Tabitha is someone who just got out of a year long relationship that basically swallowed up who she is, she is out on the town to have a little fun. Dash sees her and  he wants her. But one night is never going to be enough. Dash is used to getting what he want's, so sit back and hang on for the ride of your life when you watch Dash and Tabitha explode into your life.It is a pretty quick read and wets your appetite for more, it's hard to elaborate without giving away spoilers. SO, all I can say is give this book a chance and you won't be sorry. Again Shantel has not disappointed and has given us just what we wanted. I can't wait to read more in this series. Thank you Shantel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLC3QMG8Q7QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQPOOGG#wasThisHelpful","R2WLC3QMG8Q7QR","A2REPZEUJP88WB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REPZEUJP88WB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The reviews for this book are all over the place. I don't care for the cover but I never judge a book by it's cover (wink wink) and yes there were grammar errors but I never mention those because I don't care I know what the author is trying to say - it's never hard to figure out.There is a lot going on in this book and a lot of characters come into play which was kind of not necessary making it a longer read. Ellie has been through a lot in a short time and now just as things are starting to come together for her it all blows up when Nicholas comes back into her life. Nicholas has just been going through the motions of life since he walked away from Ellie. There isn't a day that goes by he doesn't think about her. Ellie will now forever have Nicholas in her life but having him so close has brought back those feelings she has locked away long ago. Can she move on with another man or will she finally admit her heart belongs to Nicholas? It's a rocky road and hearts will be shattered. Danger is also lurking and it will hit where it hurts the most. It's a long road to redemption but in the end it's worth it. Some hot, steamy sex scenes.

"I can't say I was a fan of Finn's in the beginning. He was kind of a jerk to Anna but then again she was kind of a push over too. Once they got past the crappy part things were hot. They of course kept things under wraps but when things in the house blew up they ran off together. Anna didn't really have much of a choice since she had no where to go. Things fall into place with Finn & Anna but of course all good things must blow up in your face right? They do and it sends Anna running. Now all the Hawthornes and Porters are together again and it get's laid on the line. Surprisingly one parent steps up and one doesn't. A lot of hot steamy juicy sex.

"I have read the second book in this series but you don't need to read the other books to follow along with this one. I Love this cover first off. This story is mostly told from High & Millie's POV but every once in awhile you get someone else's POV. It's a rough road at the beginning of the book for Millie & High because both are hurt and have been hurting for years. We get bit's of what they had in the past as it goes from past to present tense for maybe half the book. When it all is laid on the line & Millie's secret is out it's still not an easy road & heart breaking beyond belief. High is an amazing bada** biker who does flowery biker stuff. He loves his girl and he will go to the ends of the earth to prove it. Millie was a shell when High wasn't in her life & now that he is back she has come alive again. Some outside danger lurking and a whole slew of things for them to deal with. A lot of hot, juicy, amazing sex- nothing too over the top and every sex scene is not detailed out for us (which it totally ok since they are at it like rabbits). The ending was Fantastic. Now I have to go back and read the 3 in this series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T71RJBZ9QWEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76II#wasThisHelpful","R2T71RJBZ9QWEM","A3KM84RAZA7XXC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KM84RAZA7XXC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ash is young but she is a tough cookie. When her and Landon have their first chance meeting it was magical but cut short when Landon found out her age. When they cross paths again it's because their parents are together. Things are awkward and Landon has a sort of girlfriend throughout most of the book. I think the stepbrother element is silly because their parents weren't together very long nor didn't they actually live as a unit. Landon has his own issues to deal with but there is no doubt he wants Ash. Once they sort things out they decide keep their relationship under wraps for a bit but outside sources like to start drama and things get hairy. There was a lot of sex scenes - not all Ash & Landon.

When he finally thinks they have things worked out and are on the right road it blows up again but this time in it's a total cluster mess with everyone involved.  Miller finally comes to the conclusion that Sunny just won't see the good in him but this also kick starts his image make over- Less being in the bunny zone and more being in the places he wants to be- helping others.

"At first I couldn't figure out how these characters fit into the Driven series but it didn't take long to figure out Quinlan is Colten's sister.I did the audio version of this book and it tends to a bit harder to skim through because you can miss a lot in the 30 seconds you can go forward. Why would I want to skim through you ask? well I couldn't take the constant internal war Quinlan was having about how hot Hawkin is. Seriously it was over kill I wanted to scream ""we get it he's hot now move on"" but I swear it lasted for chapters. Quinlan is the girl that doesn't fawn all over Hawkin - well she does but silently. So she presents a very hot challenge for him and a beat that he isn't willing to pass up. There's a lot of baggage when it comes to Hawkin and his demons run deep. It's a messy road these two start out on and Quinlan tries to not let her heart get involved but it's impossible. As each one of Hawkins bags come open Quinlan will have to decide if he's worth the fight. Once things blow up then smooth out just to blow up again. Top that off with someone close to Hawkin that wants to hurt Quinlan and you got yourself a dramatic ending.  A lot of hot, steamy, juicy sex scenes.

Now I could find it at my local grocery store or just about anywhere but when I went to buy more they no longer had any - I thought maybe there were just out of it because it's so amazing but there wasn't even a tag on the shelf for it. So everywhere I went I looked for it but no luck - other flavors just not this one. So I couldn't find another salad dressing that even compares sadly. So I found 6 bottles here for a great price (usually $3 or more at the grocery store unless on sale) so I scooped them up then found 10 more bottles on sale at target and now I am well stock for a bit (went thru 3 bottles in 2 weeks!).

"I swear when I bought these exact headphones ~2 years ago when they were more expensive, the sound quality was pretty impressive. Now at $10, these sound like every other $10 earbuds on the market. Oh well, maybe I'm just imagining things.What could either frustrate you to no end, or be very, very pleasant is the fact that these actually go inside your ear and sort-of seal off outside noises. This gives that sort of 'stethoscope' effect where you can hear the cords every time they're being touched, but it's great for blocking out noises when you're playing music. I used these on a long 8 hour flight situated behind two perpetually crying defecating infants, and these headphones were the only things keeping me sane.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C6701816YTVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VP9MOO#wasThisHelpful","R1C6701816YTVX","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am using this in combination with my 10"" Windows 8 tablet. Haven't experienced any problems so far--pretty straightforward to set up and use; feels very nice, considering the price. This appears to be identical to the twice-as-expensive Anker keyboard.SIZE-The keys are literally the same size as the ones on my 13"" laptop's keyboard, with the spacing nearly identical as well; if you've ever tried chiclet keys on a laptop, I'm sure you'll have no problem transitioning to this keyboard. I haven't experienced any lag or delays in terms of characters appearing on the screen, and my typing speed is well over 100WPM.-The tablet is overall very slim, except for the top of the back (which houses the batteries and on/off switch); this is nice, however, because it raises the keyboard into a more ergonomic position. You could hypothetically stick this in your bag for on-the-go use, but there's nothing to protect the keys. I personally use a folding keyboard for outside the house, and intend to keep this one for house use.LAYOUT-The only small complaint I have is that I wish the fn and 'control' keys were switched--I find myself always hitting the 'fn' key on accident, because they're usually the other way around on most keyboards. The 'control' key is the tiniest bit awkward to access, if you're a fast typist like myself.-The 'hot key's really aren't designed for Windows--the homescreen button, for example, takes you to Internet Explorer, and the brightness keys don't work. The hot keys that do work are the volume and play/pause buttons--which are really the ones that matter, so they're nice to have.FYI: If you're using an Android tablet, you can download an app ('external keyboard pro') that allows you to customize keyboards layouts yourself, and make your own 'hot keys'. Sadly, Windows is fairly primitive in terms of accessible customization.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EFR5QUB58RB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQZUIP2#wasThisHelpful","R3EFR5QUB58RB4","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the case for the Vivotab ME400; all the other cases for this tablet are 5x the cost with mixed reviews. I bought this spur-of-the-moment as an add-on, but was pleasantly surprised at the durability and fit. Access to buttons/ports and touch screen is not hindered. Auto wake magnetic flap works great. The stand is durable enough that you can touch the screen without worrying about it tipping over. I see no faults with this case, other than that it's definitely not the slimmest one around (better that way though, it feels very sturdy).For the ridiculously cheap price, I expected it too look/feel a whole lot cheesier, but it's actually quite nice.

"Can't complain--no visible degradation in screen clarity, a lot smoother than touching/swiping on the actual glass screen, fingerprints aren't visible when the screen is on, successfully reduces glare.My only grievance is that installation was a huge pain in the butt--however, that's just what happens when you try to install a stiff screen protector on a giant 10"" screen. What made this a little more difficult to install is that the screen protector is literally the same size as the glass itself; if the fit isn't absolutely PERFECTLY lined up, one or more of the corners will be lifted by the rim and won't lay flat on the glass, so you have to redo it all over again. Despite spending close to half an hour meticulously wiping away dust and removing it with the sticker, I still managed to get ~3 bubbles that won't go away. Oh well, I'm not picky.Unlike other screen protectors I've had for my other devices, this comes with a couple handy stickers that pick up lint/dust, even from the back of the screen protector itself.

"I take this pack basically every time I travel, for impromptu day hikes (to hold mostly food/water/other basics), and a couple weekend road trips for camping (mostly to hold my clothes and such). I also plan on using this for an upcoming plane trip, wherein it'll be used as a carry-on to hold souvenirs (it'll be folded in my suitcase on the way there). I imagine you could also use this for groceries if you're biking/walking to a store.Although not the most compact backpack you could get, it's probably the best quality for the size: the straps are padded, the back has mesh, there's an insert for a hydration sack (with a hole for a straw), etc; it's basically like a normal full-sized backpack when unfolded. I've used it for about a year now (maybe ~30 times), and the fabric is holding up great. It has a couple stretch points where sharp corners came in contact with the material, but that's to be expected.My only complaint is this: because the bag closes by rolling up and doesn't have a zip closure, the middle ALWAYS tends to unroll/unravel, which pushes the weight further down and away from you--meaning you're carrying most of the weight around your lower back, and the pack doesn't hug your shoulders snugly no matter how you tighten it. What you see in the picture (an almost perfectly rectangular shape) will never happen because everything sags down and out, unless you're literally just carrying a pillow. This bag would have benefited significantly from just a couple vertical straps to secure the weight (like the older model of the North Face Flyweight rucksack).For what it is, I think it's the best backpack out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GONVNWXKTPXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005N15P2O#wasThisHelpful","R1GONVNWXKTPXX","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A much simpler, easier way to get your daily fiber without having to eat a bowl of bland bran flakes every day. The daily recommended consumption is 2 gummies, which gives you 5 grams of fiber.

"You can't really go wrong with this item--it's 12 ounces of chia seeds, plain and simple. The only complaint I have is that there are occasional pieces of non-food particles (tiny bits of branches/stems/etc)--but that's probably unavoidable anyway.Chia seeds almost have the same texture as sesame seeds, in the sense that they are small and have soft shells--which means you don't need to do anything to the seeds before you use them (unlike flax seeds, which are so hard you have to grind them first). One neat thing about chia seeds is that, when left in liquid, they thicken and form an almost tapioca-like coating (similar to tomato seeds).I bought these for the sole purpose of making chia seed 'pudding'--basically pour a glass of almond (or any other) milk, add honey to taste, pour in a couple tablespoons of chia seeds, then stir. Let it sit overnight, and in the morning it's just as thick as tapioca pudding.

"I would liken more as a wide stool with pedals in front of it, rather than a true upright seat; the top reviewer mentioning biomechanics was spot-on; a true upright bike has pedals directly UNDER the seat, but the pedals on this bike stick a good ~2 feet out from under the seat. It's kind of an awkward mix of an upright and recumbent bike, but it doesn't necessarily make for a bad experience.Pros:------------------------------------------------------------------WHISPER-QUIET: The gears literally make no noise.-SMOOTH PEDALING: Very smooth, no hiccups or bumps.-SOLID CONSTRUCTION: For a $150 piece of equipment, this thing is surprisingly solid and sturdy.-EASY ASSEMBLY: Instructions are clear and obvious; compared to, say, Ikea furniture, assembly is a dream.-GREAT VALUE: This costs less than half a year's worth of a basic gym membershipCons:------------------------------------------------------------------DAMAGES EASILY DURING SHIPMENT: Myself and apparently many other reviewers received damaged/broken items that had to be replaced; in fact, the bike I originally received looked like it had already been opened and used. Everything is solidly constructed, but the main gears are encased in a plastic shell which seems to break easily during shipment (see pictures). Amazon replaced it without any hassle, but it was still mildly annoying having to wait longer.-RIDICULOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE SEAT: At this point, I can't even bike for more than a minute at a time because of the seat; it's wide, flat, and not very cushioned--which makes for an uncomfortable if not painful experience when moving your legs. If you have prominent sit bones, you're in for a world of hurt; if you have a natural 'cushion' on your bum or are muscular enough, you don't need to worry too much. On the plus side, it wouldn't be terrible difficult to DIY a seat and screw it on to the seat base.-NOT IDEAL FOR SHORT LEGS: I'm 5'6, but I have relatively short legs for someone my height; the lowest seat height just barely works for me.OVERALL: Well-built, great price. As long as you're not looking for a TRUE upright bike, you can't go wrong. The seat is uncomfortable, but if you're handy you can just attach your own. Not ideal for short people, or people with short legs.----------------Update: DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE PRONOUNCED 'SIT-BONES'! I even tried removing the seat and DIY'ing my own, but the seat base is an awkwardly wide metal triangle--there's no way to fix contact with the ischial tuberosities. I just wasted $150 on a bike that is way too painful for me to ever use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BO42ALPIK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007595TKU#wasThisHelpful","R7BO42ALPIK7","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The ice cream flavors taste more artificial, but are true to their respective names (berry, chocolate); however, they aren't at all creamy or milky like I was hoping they'd be. For true creamy flavor (akin to sweetened condensed milk), I would try Milkita lollipops.PACKAGING: Comes prepackaged in a convenient display box--very easy to pick a lollipop and know which flavor you're getting.CONTENTS: Yours may be different, but mine mostly consisted of Strawberries and Cream ice cream, and Strawberry yogurt:-14 Choco-Vanilla (ice cream flavor)-18 Strawberries and Cream (ice cream flavor) --> doesn't really taste like strawberries so much as a generic 'berry' flavor- 7 Mango Yogurt (yogurt flavor)- 9 Strawberry Yogurt","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WLECPQPP451/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005I65010#wasThisHelpful","R3WLECPQPP451","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Each individual pop measures about 6 inches in circumference, and about 3 inches in height. They're roughly the same size and shape as an egg (i.e. they're not round). Does not make for a bite-sized treat. The two sides of the pan fit pretty snug with the plastic clips, but there's still wiggle room--at least on my pan, one side slightly lifts up (see uploaded picture for pan shape).If you follow the recipe as directed (e.g., using melting candy chips instead of icing, cutting down on the liquid content in the cake recipe) you shouldn't have a problem with the cake pops themselves; however, if the awkward size and shape bother you, you might as well spend the extra five bucks for the Nordic Ware pan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E94DI1N9ZE5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006BE7322#wasThisHelpful","R1E94DI1N9ZE5F","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Surprisingly few pressed makeup palettes contain wearable matte shadows--although I love brands like Urban Decay, all their palettes tend to contain shimmery or glittery eyeshadows. Mattes seem to be a little harder to pull off that shimmery shadows--cheaply made mattes tend to be chalky or poorly pigmented. These shadows, on the other hand, are richly pigmented, long-lasting, easy to blend, and very much wearable.This palette contains a versatile array of 16 shadows--7 matte, 9 shimmery; they are as follows:White: a pure white eyeshadow with subtle glitter (shimmery)Cream: a more natural, skin-toned highlighter (matte)Taupe: a light brown (matte)Lt. Pink: a pale, rose-toned pink (matte)Mauve: a mauve taupe; looks brown in the palette, but has purple undertones (matte)Sable: a richly saturated earth-toned brown (matte)Espresso: a veeryy dark brown, almost indistinguishable from black except that it has brown undertones (matte)Black: a nicely pigmented black, with grey undertones (matte)Nude: a lovely white-gold shimmer (shimmery)Champagne: a slightly darker, pinker shimmer (shimmery)Gold: a rich copper shimmer (shimmery)Lt. Bronze: similar to champagne, but slightly darker with less glitter (shimmery)Pewter: a deep greyish-brown (shimmery)Garnet: a rosey, dark brown (shimmery)Deep Purple: an almost black shimmer with deep purple undertones (shimmery)Slate: a deep bluish grey (shimmery)This makes for the PERFECT everyday/nude palette, with enough gorgeous shimmery shadows to pull off more than a few dramatic looks. The shadows are long-lasting enough on their own, but the included primer really makes these shadows stand out. Overall, it's a must-have makeup set!(the palette itself is very slim and compact, measuring at 7.5"" by 3"" by 3/8"". Each shadow measures about 3/4 square inch. The included primer is .19 oz.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XVR4NKATWX5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XNJXXQ#wasThisHelpful","R2XVR4NKATWX5N","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The case is nice, but you can tell it wasn't designed with the Nexus 7 *specifically* in mind. It fits the device well, but there are a few major design flaws. However, for the price and its 360 rotation, it's nice to have.PROS:-DEEP RIDGES: There are two ridges on the inside flap which support your N7 in both landscape mode and portrait mode. these ridges are deep, so your device won't flop around or fall when you touch it [EXCEPT, the first ridge does not provide sturdy support for portrait mode]-NICE GRAPHICS: I figured the map design would be a nice change from the regular faux-leather black. It doesn't look cheesy or anything.-EASY TO PUT ON/TAKE OUT: The hard shell easily snaps onto your device, and there is no risk of it slipping out.-MINIMAL DESIGN: I like the hard shell that attaches to the device--it looks a lot sleeker than those cheesy faux leather elasticized slips that always cover the bezel.CONS:-THICK: This case is definitely thick; everything about it is thick, especially the front flap. Despite its thickness, I doubt it could provide much shock absorption as it's all pretty hard and non-rubberized.-FRONT FLAP IS TOTALLY LOOSE, WIGGLES AROUND: The front flap just loosely flaps around; since it's a 360* case, it kind of awkwardly wiggles in every direction. In order to secure the flap to the front, you need to wrap the elastic around the back of the case. hooowever:-ELASTIC COVERS HEADPHONE JACK: Terribly inconvenient if you use your device to listen to music on-the-go. That means when I'm outside, I either have to forego music (I commute on the subway, I always listen to music), or have the case wobble and flap around all the time.-AUTOMATIC SLEEP/WAKE IS FAULTY: because the front flap wobbles around and flaps everywhere, it doesn't always turn your device on or shut it off. It usually does a good job of waking your device, but a terrible job of putting it to sleep.-LEAVES SMUDGES ON THE SCREEN: the interior of the front flap is soft, but when it presses against the screen it leaves weird smudge marks.Basically, the source of all my complaints comes from the FRONT FLAP: awkwardly flap loosely unless you secure it with the built-in elastic (which covers the headphone jack); does a terrible job of putting the device to sleep; adds considerable bulk to your device; leaves smudges all over your screen; etc. If it weren't from the steal price, I'd rate it 3/5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUJBVKXH6O6BF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XFLRHE#wasThisHelpful","RUJBVKXH6O6BF","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No joke, this looks like some knockoff app a student developer made in his spare time--I CANNOT believe this is the ""official"" EA Games app! For such an iconic game, you'd think they'd make more of an effort like they did with Tetris. I feel like I'm running Windows 95 every time I play this app on my Nexus 7.FUNCTIONALITY: On my 7"" device, it reacts weirdly with the touchscreen--e.g. to touch a card, I have to touch like two inches below it.GAMEPLAY: missing some pretty key features, like the money pool. But all the basics are there.AI: there are three levels of difficulty, all of which seem to pertain to the dice. Dice are CLEARLY not random, which is disappointing as you could never have a truly fair game. AI always move in very predictable ways, it gets a little repetitive (e.g., one specifically doesn't own many properties, but saves up for Boardwalk).Fun for $.99, but the developers really need to step it up with the graphics and gameplay.

"Just a note: this is identical to the generic folding keyboards found on Ebay, except that the generic version comes with a folding tablet stand.DIMENSIONS:*when folded, the keyboard measures 5.6"" x 3.5"" x .6""; very slim and portable.*there's a good .16"" space between each key*most alphanumeric keys are about .5"" in width; though, the middle keys are elongatedEXTRA FUNCTIONS: when you press the FN key in combination with the below keys, you activate:*F4: lower vol; F5: increase vol; F6: rewind; F7: play/pause; F8: ffw; F10: screen off; Shift key: home screen; Capslock: Google Now.(these are what work on my Nexus 7 right off the bat; a few things like ""volume mute"" aren't compatible with my device).****If you have an Android device and want to program even more functions on your keyboard, I highly recommend the app ""External Keyboard Helper Pro""; it's a little confusing so I recommend reading the online tutorials, but basically it allows you to turn any keystroke into a shortcut for apps, shortcut for text, or shortcut for functions like volume/brightness.****PROS:*THIN AND SLIM: would easily fit in your back pocket, let alone your purse or backpack.*KEYS ARE NICELY SPACED OUT: I've had mini keyboards where the keys were so tightly packed together, it was impossible not to make typos. The spacing between these keys is generous enough not to impede typing accuracy.*TWO YEAR WARRANTY: can't really speak for how reliable the company is, but the user manual indicates that they warrant against 'defects in material an workmanship for a period of 2 years'.*CHARGABLE INTERNAL BATTERY: Great that you don't have to use AAA batteries or anything, it has its own chargable lithium ion battery.*EXTRA FUNCTIONALITY: (see above)CONS:*FEELS A LITTLE CHEAP/FLIMSY: wouldn't take much to snap this thing. keys feel kinda cheap, I wouldn't say they're from a business class laptop. as for scissor keys--most laptop keyboards have scissor keys, so don't expect this to be any quieter than what you're used to.*NO TABLET STAND: in the photos, it is shown with a tablet stand. I'm only saying this because this product is identical to the generic folding keyboards found on ebay. Not a big deal, but I was hoping for one.*UNTRADITIONAL LAYOUT: might take a little getting used to; a lot of the middle keys are stretched out, so there's quite a bit of space between the ""r"" and ""u"".*DOESN'T LOCK INTO PLACE WHEN UNFOLDED: you can only really use this on hard, flat, stable surfaces. Not really a big deal, but it's something to note.*NO NUMLOCK/SCROLL LOCK LED LIGHTS: some might miss this feature, I don't.*BATTERY INDICATOR IS SIMPLISTIC: just one light that shines red when you're charging.*NO DEDICATED ON/OFF INDICATOR: noo idea how to turn this thing off. I guess it just shuts off by itself? I tried pressing 3+ seconds, which is how you turn it on, but that didn't seem to do anything.I'm only pointing out cons in case they might be an issue for other people--for me, this is pretty much exactly what I was looking for! can't speak about battery life or the overall durability of this item since I haven't had it that long, but it seems like the best option out there for someone who wants a portable keyboard for their tablet.

"I have nothing bad to say about this case. It's well, well worth the money, and does its job well. I literally paid four bucks for this thing, just to test out a magnetic-closure case--but now I use it more often than the original case I had. The exterior is inconspicuous and doesn't look as cheap as it is. There is a slot in the back for the sound, and an elastic hoop at the bottom to hold your stylus. The magnetic flap has grooves on the inside, which allow you to set your tablet at various viewing angles.Just a note--it'll take a few days for the case to comfortably close with the device in it--when you secure your tablet with the velcro, it'll add enough bulk that closing the case will be kind of awkward. Once it molds to your device, it works great.(be extremely careful when opening the package. Amazon packaged this item with another item I purchased, and crammed this case directly underneath the top flaps of the box.

"Let me start by saying that I've never had much luck with laptops. The last laptop I purchased before this (Dell) had a measly life of 1 year and 1 month, despite its $1000 price tag; it was defective to begin with, so within 10 minutes of using it, it literally died and could not be repaired. They had to send a replacement device, which itself died half a year after due to a faulty motherboard. That replacement had to be replaced, with a downgraded device that was not the same as the one I originally paid for. By the time it was on its last limb, you could fry an egg on it within 5 minutes of it starting up. Did I mention it died the weekend before finals?This device, on the other hand, has worked perfectly since December of 2010--almost two years and counting. It's slim, lightweight, and thin (well, by 2010's standards) but surprisingly sturdy. As a student, I've carried it from class to class, dropped it, abused it, kept it on over 24 hours to pull overnighters, etc. And it still works great to this day! My sister actually sat on it a year ago, which caused some dead pixels in the corner--thanks to the accidental damage support warranty, they replaced the screen free of charge. Some of the plastic and paint will chip off after years of abuse, but nothing serious that would impede the functioning of the device. If you need a laptop that won't break your arm carrying it around, and can hold up to the abuse of a student lifestyle, I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JXBAS6CPW6OZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XRDA4A#wasThisHelpful","R1JXBAS6CPW6OZ","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just echoing the sentiments of everyone else: it's a thought-provoking and emotional film, but not in the slightest historically accurate. Critics say that its fairytale plot over-simplifies/trivializes/commercially exploits the Holocaust; and that by allowing impossible events to take place or glossing over critical facts, less informed audiences might assume concentration camps weren't nearly as bad as they are.Although I think the latter is an especially dangerous line to cross, I defend the film for what it is--the narrative of a sheltered boy. His innocence isn't meant to symbolize/defend people who pretend they didn't know what was happening at the time--his misinformation is just that of a child whose mother attempts to conceal the truth. After all, the movie is MEANT to exist through the naivete of a child's world.If you want accuracy, go read a memoir instead of a fantastical distortion written in a few days by an author with no connection to the Holocaust--if you think the subject is too grim for fairytales, this might upset you. If you want tweens to understand that time period, I would rather recommend ""I Have Lived A Thousand Years""; this isn't the type of movie to learn from. Otherwise, ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" is a must-watch emotional 'what-if' historical fiction with superb acting and character development.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRMY66A71XB1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00628RVV0#wasThisHelpful","RRMY66A71XB1P","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CONSTRUCTION: These headphones broke two days after I received them--about five minutes into a 5-hour plane ride to a fairly remote island with no stores selling headphones. Needless to say, I was upset. I will update this review if I attempt to act on their ""1-year warranty"".SOUND QUALITY: comparable to headphones under $10. Slightly better bass, but vocals sound muffled. In fact, I've tried $10 headphones that were much better in both sound quality and construction. Are they noise-isolating? barely--not enough to hear music on a subway ride (again, I've had cheap headphones I could actually use on a subway ride).FIT: design is awkward and uncomfortable--if you fall asleep listening to music, you can't sleep on your side. The design neither contributes to comfort nor sound isolation--it's pretty superfluous.HEADSET: the microphone is a tiny pinprick, bad quality as well. The only other feature is a button from which you can pause or play music--very rudimentary.BOTTOM LINE: These are just plain bad. I would heed the overwhelming amount of negative reviews (coincidentally, all rated uninformative by some vicious defender) and save your money.

"SIZE/SHAPE: Small, paper-thin circles about an inch and a half in diameter. great for traveling.EFFICIENCY: These do a better job of remover makeup than facial makeup cloths (i.e. no vigorous rubbing needed), but ultimately they're not as good as a liquid makeup remover. You could even put lotion on a cotton ball and it would work just as well. So there's no need to ever subject my eyes to this again.IRRITATION: The third listed ingredient is butylene glycol, which is a known skin irritant (and also, eyeball irritant).

"**these run a half-size small--I'm a 7.5 and the size 7 shoes fit perfectly**I have read two things that happen when you wear these often: 1) they become more flexible over time, and 2) the top mesh gets torn very easily. I will update my review if anything negative happens. So far, after purchasing them today and walking around a bit, they're great.FIT: No less time-consuming to put on than lace-up sneakers--slip your foot in with the help of the cord, and strap up. Although more fitted than tennis shoes, these aren't nearly as flexible as ""true"" barefoot shoes--I have no toe mobility in these, and I can't bend my feet either. The pads on the bottom are firm (i.e. not really soft/cushioned), but contour my feet nicely. Overall, the fit is great and I can't imagine these causing blistering or pain.CONSTRUCTION: Looks rather cheap--even in some stock photos online, you can see sloppy glue-work on the toes. That, and the fact that they tear easily, is why I'd give them 4/5 instead of 5/5. The velcro closure system is vaguely reminiscent of toddler's shoes.APPEARANCE: Who knows why Amazon called these 'fashion' sneakers--they look ridiculous unless you're near water. My whole family had a good laugh when I modeled these babies. I don't intend to wear these out in the public, unless I'm running or doing some light hiking.If you live a diehard 'natural foot' lifestyle (i.e. ultra-flexible, thin), definitely look elsewhere--otherwise, they're great.

There is a zipper inside the larger pouch, and on the outside above the smaller pouch. The straps are held together by snaps on the inside, which--when removed--convert the bag into a wristlet (there is a large loop on the zipper of the small pouch).-fun colors are bright but surprisingly functional-lightweight, small.CONS:-You pretty much can't fit ANYTHING in this bag. Lots of zippers and pouches, but really no room to expand to allow anything larger than maybe one small cellphone.-Unfortunate zipper placement. Since I can't even fit a small wallet in this, I took out my credit card, IDs, and some cash--really small, flat objects that should in theory fit in any compartment. Whelp, they can't fit in any of the zippers, aside from the small pouch (which already store my cellphone). If you try to put your cards in the inside zipper, it can't fold over and snap shut. If you put it on the outside zipper above the small pouch, you can (barely) snap it shut, but the bag looks awkwardly strained.-Cheap material: like the previous reviewer said, the color rubs off SO easily! I wore it for one day, with clothes that would never leak dye. When I turned the bag around, I realized the bright papaya had rubbed off.OVERALL: It's cute, small, and fun to have around--but barely functional. NOT intended to carry anything more than a little bit of cash (if stored in the main pouch, unprotected by zippers) and a cellphone. I don't necessarily regret the purchase, but the design was clearly more for show than functionality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O2LJ4XPA90UF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006H57R6C#wasThisHelpful","R2O2LJ4XPA90UF","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Relatively interesting insight into the lives of 3 up-and-coming designers; the content is decent, albeit nothing memorable or noteworthy. I mostly felt compelled to write a review because of the poor filming--it was like someone removed autofocus on a point-and-shoot camera and gave it to a 3-year-old to wander around with.I understand some out-of-focus lens blur and camera shake is purely artistic, but--given the fact that it was headache-inducing--it was evidently unintentional. e.g. when people are talking, everyone and everything is out of focus (gets pretty frustrating after a while). That, and the camera frequently zooms in (with a shaky hand) and wanders on peoples noses or mouths. Oh, and lots of visible boom mikes and cameramen.The unfocused, wandering lens gave me a headache so I had to stop watching; I'm never nitpicky about cinematography in documentaries, but if I can't even finish the film it should be commented on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M5UGVOYCYZCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000DN5VFS#wasThisHelpful","R1M5UGVOYCYZCC","A3A3F5N7NZCVMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A3F5N7NZCVMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"05/28/2015.  I haven't used HyperX Cloud Gaming Headset - Black... yet, but the packaging from the manufacturer is truly impressive and well done.  One complaint is that there are no instructions in the product and only a simple reference to log onto their website for instructions.  Once I did that I now know why.  The electronic instruction manual is in 14 languages (169 pages) and 32 mb large. Even in English the instructions are incomplete and you have to view a video to see how to utilize the extra soft ear cups.  Other than that, the earphones are impressive.  I'm looking forward to using them. My reason for buying is that I had an inexpensive (well, sort of) set with a microphone/headset for a Rosetta language course and the 3.5mm plug separated from the wire. The wire is so fine that even I can't resolder it successfully, so the are effectively trash.  The HyperX Cloud Gaming Headset has a nylon braid reinforced wiring to the headphones that is very sturdy. I expect success with this unit.  Oh yes, there is a two year warranty but it's printed on the inside of the shipping container and you would not likely see it, unless you are looking for it. Not the brightest idea in the box. I'll let you know what I think after I use the.  I do not do gaming, so will not comment on that use.06-02-2015. UPDATE.

"10/1/2014. Solid steel ring mandrel weighs 27.2 ounces and is 12 inches in length. Machining lathe cuts make it not smooth and rings tend to jam on the mandrel when you try to remove them. No indication as to what standard (e.g., U.S., Europe) the sizing is measured to. Using a precision caliper measurement tool and the standard U.S. Ring specification of Zales jewelry stores, I find that the sizing on the Steel Ring Mandrel varies inconsistently along the length of the bar from a +.07 mm to a -0.20 mm.

The sizing bands are so wide that placing one slightly too small on your finger can make it very difficult to remove, so start with one too large and work down to your size.

"5-20-14.  I installed this ladder over the weekend on my 2013 Ford F-150 and it works very well.  It comes with four rust resistant 1.5 inch self-tapping sturdy square-drive screws. The square-drive bit is included - a smart touch. The metal cover on the inside of the tailgate is not very thick so I added two exta stainless steel 10-1 inch screws for extra attachment support. Directions are adequate.  The ladder is very well made - excellent quality and easy to unfold and refold. The ladder has a latch to keep it in place during period of non-use.  I recommend it for the high-level pickup tailgates on the newer Ford F-150 and other models.  Especially good when a person needs the extra conveniene of getting into and out of the truck bed.  Holding onto the truck bed side is adequate for balancing during entry and exit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VFBVK4VPJO9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00180UVGO#wasThisHelpful","R3VFBVK4VPJO9M","A4GHPW9AAH1NY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GHPW9AAH1NY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4-14-14. I haven't needed it in an emergency yet, but this is one ""really cool"" warning device.Pros: 1. Ten different functions for lights.  2. Small enough to fit easily in the side door pocket or glove compartment of my truck or car. 3. It will greatly improve my opportunity to be avoifed if my vehicle brakes down during low light periods.  4.Does NOT emit any sounds (why would it?).Cons: 1. Only drawback is that when initially received, the very small paper label on the magnet says to ""remove insulation""....what does that mean?  After reading the instructions and finally managing to open the device to check the batteries (it would not light), I figured out they must have meant the paper insulator at the end of the battery to prevent accidental starting prior to customer use. Rather inadequate instruction. However, after removing the paper insulator, it works just fine. 2. Opening the device is difficult and requires rather forcefull prying at the ""tabs"" without beaking them.  The gasket is very tight, but once started to open the rest is easy. 3. Closure says to remember the ""tab"" alignment"".  Very vague.  Actually, the ""tabs"" are on either side of the ""flashlight"" feature (white LEDs).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSNMFZ9PKZYV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C8YXGB6#wasThisHelpful","RSNMFZ9PKZYV6","A4GHPW9AAH1NY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4GHPW9AAH1NY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Loved it. It's a brilliant movie, which in my opinion foreshadows what Tim Cook will have to overcome to keep Apple Inc. where it is - the most valuable company on this planet.Obviously, turning your company into  the most valuable company on this planet can't be easy, it is even more difficult when this move follows a near bankruptcy experience. It is probably fair to say that only a ruthless, dedicated, maniac person, like Steve Jobs, could do it.Though Jobs may have never searched for accolades like ""Apple Inc. being the most valuable company on this planet,"" he aimed for better - he wanted to change the world.The movie brings out how Jobs went about it.Truly appalling is the early story of how as a young man Jobs cheated his best friend Woz out of $3,150; especially appalling because Jobs himself/alone could not have done this project. He bit the hand that fed him, which was also his best friend's hand.How could a man who did this over and over again, get away with it and get celebrated for it?This is where this movie shines. Jobs does not lie about Lisa being his daughter or cheat Woz out of money because he is a bad guy, he does what he does because he has only one goal - to change the world. People, who don't understand or don't play along, go conform and support, will be declared enemies. Jobs does not hang around to do harm to them or whatever, he only gets rid of them so he can follow his ""higher goal.""It is the intellectual puritans' dream to be able to focus so intently on whatever we need to do, that success becomes a logical conclusion. It is Jobs' tragedy that he could not overcome cancer.That's why we still love him and will always love him. Somehow he was a God (a supernatural genius), who was mortal. This gives us hope that we could became  geniuses, too.GREAT MOVIE!

"""... âFrom the day I met you, I knew you were the one for me and I knew this day would come. We are each otherâs center of the universe. We are relaxed in each other's company...""This is part of Brandon's marriage proposal to Olivia. Notice the sentence ""We are relaxed in each other's company..."" to understand what is special about Olivia's and Brandon's relationship.Author Ica Iova, manages to draw a picture of a relationship all of us dream about. We want to be relaxed in each other's company... The heroine of this story, Olivia, also knows that by sheer luck she met a truly special man, which is why she is going along with his ideas, getting engaged quickly, planning for a baby quickly, getting a dog to make the family complete...It would take a special catastrophe to undo this dream. And, sadly it happens. Even though Brandon is a criminal lawyer he is being asked to represent a young orphan, Stacy, in probate court. Brandon cannot save the case, Stacy's recently deceased father owed too much money. In light of that she'll lose her ""bastion of strength, her house"" Stacy kills herself; and, Brandon blames himself for her death.Stacy's diary is some of the finest writing I have read in a long time; in fact, I found it so powerful that the following ghost story could not really compete.  Author Ica Iova's text of Stacy's diary, is beautiful, haunting, simple, and immensely powerful. It makes it clear why a) Brandon blames himself for Stacy's death and b) he starts drinking and doing drugs, occasionally.Olivia understands that too, but when Brandon's drinking goes on for too long, she puts her foot down - either Brandon cleans up or she and little Brayden will leave.Then, Brandon has one relapse, and during the same night Olivia ends up dead. The obvious suspect is Brandon.  Still, I knew that Brandon had not done it. Author Ica Iova describes his latest drinking episode so vividly and excellently, that Brandon could not have been the murderer. So, who killed Olivia?Olivia, now a ghost, is trying to find out herself. Beautifully (and somewhat logically)  Iova develops a plot, that little Brayden can ""see"" Olivia's ghost, thereby creating a logical basis why Olivia wants to hang around ( to be with Brayden) and also t solve the mystery.No spoilers from this reviewer. All I want to say is, ""I missed the intro of the murderer.""

"If you are a frequent reader of my book reviews you will know that I often complain that so called ""non fiction authors"" are trying to sell what is really a marketing brochure and not a nonfiction book; and also marketing people claim that they are authors simply because they have penned some kind of literary work which fits into the category non-fiction writings.Having reminded of this situation I can honestly say that ""Camping: The Ultimate Camping Experience: Your All-You-Need-To-Know Guide To Gear, Food, Bonfires, Outdoor Fun & More"" by Thomas Nero was the best non-fiction book how-to book I have read in a long time. An avid camper myself, I can vouch for that Thomas Nero knows his stuff; he's been camping a lot.What I really appreciated about this book was its completeness.

And, the thing is, after overcoming the immigration issues, the white wedding would be the easy thing. The issue is, that Linus does not want her to have what she really wants more than anything.(Female readers are going to love this book.)Only having read this book but never having met Claudette, I can say with certainty that Linus made a bad mistake. A woman like Claudette wasn't going to settle for trickery. And, so it happens that Claudette continues her journey alone, in Canada.

"Author Elizabeth Hall's book ""Dig Deep & Excel, TWITTER MARKETING Action Sheets Guide"" is a good book. It does NOT portray that success on twitter will come easily. She walks the reader through a strategic plan of ""Identify Goals and Objectives"" and ""Set Realistic Goals and Expect Realistic Results"" and I believe, indeed, that's what most people miss. They have heard about twitter's role during the Arab Spring and think this is how it ""should happen"" for them.I also liked that the author stresses,""...

"To state this upfront, I received a sample of Island Fresh SUPERIOR Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in exchange for an unbiased and objective review, and how glad I was.Over the last few years coconut has emerged as a healthy alternative to cooking and broiling fat but it also has lots of other uses.In my household we love pasta, thus I used this coconut oil to put it on freshly cooked pasta, just like so - what a heavenly taste! Creamy, yet not fat-fat, with a delicious aroma like ""vacation."" This is probably be furthered by the fact that I have a small kitchen and the coconut oil's wonderful scent lingered in the kitchen though I had the windows open. I love this product's creamy texture. I also used the coconut oil to fry the left over pasta and some chicken. The different tastes go very well together. I haven't baked with it yet, but the season will start soon.An avid coffee drinker myself I have known for while that mixing a teaspoon full of coconut oil into black coffee in the morning has health benefits. This coconut oil has such a dreamy taste I did not even need coffee creamer.Also used a small amount as a body lotion after showering. What a fabulous feeling, but beware - you'll want to go on vacation when you smell your skin.Lastly, I also tested this coconut oil as a hair mask. It left my hair feeling stronger and youthful BUT beware, it also made my (artificial) hair color fade in some areas. (I use L'Oreal hair color). Be sure to test this first and do not apply without testing before going to a special event. Still, I am going to do hair masks with this product again. At my age I can afford showing some gray streaks; the strengthening effect outweighs the few gray streaks which appeared after washing out the coconut oil.Love the product.

"Obviously, it's healthy chocolate, it has a pleasant taste, but it did not knock me out of my boots. I like the crunchy texture, but there chocolate tasted relatively plain - not too sweet, no particularly dominant taste. It is what I'd call ""fine"" but nothing to write home about.

I bought two bars at Whole Foods. They were on sale, 2 bars for $8.00.No regrets regarding the purchase but I will have to try a few other brands.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4KAIWE5XFO0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZIZGDE#wasThisHelpful","R4KAIWE5XFO0X","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love Dr. Berman's humor.Dr. Berman's book was a complete surprise to me. Even though I have used tampons for a long time I never gave it much thought ""what else "" one could do with them.Now, a man showed me - thank God, he is a doctor, which helped my creative ego to survive the mental  blow and the realization that maybe I am not as creative as I thought I am.This book is funny, reminiscent of glorious days, creative and stimulating. Highly recommended.Outstanding among the 99 examples:#2 - Tuck one behind the ear, to resemble movie stars of yore, who kept their cigarettes there If only Bogie would have done that, maybe he would have been much longer with us...)#5 - Build in igloo. I had at least one neighbor who I would have liked to annoy with some a contraption#12 - with biting humor - make a picture frame for your favorite selfie#21 - coat them in wax to make long lastng candles - I bet THAT works!#35 - put message inside of applicator and send by way of carrier pigeon#44 - U se the extra large size as hair curler (I remember at least one occasion when this knowledge would have helped me)and my most favorite illustration is #54 - I laughed and laughed and laughed- you'll have to check out the book to see why.A special mention needs to be made of Jordyn Newsome's art work. It is excellent.This is the book you should gift the person who has everything - it is bound to create laughter. This is also the book you should gift anybody who is a bit short on money but managed to buy large quantities of tampons at an auction or some Dollar store cheaply. Love this book.

"If you are watching your weight THIS is the snack you ought to get.I bought these rice cakes at a local store where they were the ""special of the day."" The funny thing is I don't even like rice cakes; usually rice cakes are these tasteless items people eat because rice cakes don't have too many calories but you still get to nibble on something... to me, rice cakes used to be a kind of the ""whatever"" item.Then, on a rainy afternoon last week I entered a grocery store and saw a poor young lady whose job it was to offer samples of these rice cakes, but - because of the rain only very few people were in the store and nobody seemed interested in tasting these rice cakes. Poor mercy with this young lady got me to stop and first taste the ""orange rice cakes,"" and then ""Strawberry'n'creme."" I liked ""Strawberry'n'creme.""  Being in a positive mood I bought a pack.It turned out that the tiny sample I received at the store wasn't even enough to explore the phenomenal taste experience. These are not your ordinary boring rice cakes, nope, each one is a satisfying taste experience. Considering that each cake has only 80 calories AND is ""all natural"" and ""glutenfree"" that is a fabulous deal. Finally, a sweet snack that one can snack late night without having to feel guilty.Love them.The rice cakes are not cheap because they are imported from Italy, but what the heck, keeping an eye on calories is usually not a cheap. Cheap stuff almost always comes with lots of calories.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SEQBLU8DIB6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D19UKTI#wasThisHelpful","R3SEQBLU8DIB6Z","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has a major flaw and it is its title.  Somehow the title implies that the reader gets to learn substantial information about how to use twitter effectively; after all, getting 100K followers is no small feat. Everybody who has twiddle-tweeted on Twitter knows that.The problem is that author Ted Tayler describes only one way how to go about reaching the 100K subscribers - his way (which isn't meant negatively in any way) - via using Tweepi.If you are already a subscriber of Tweepi  I would urge you to buy this book and study it, twice. I am under the impression that the book describes the process well. My problem is that I used to be a Tweepi subscriber (in 2013) and I made bad experiences. Though I followed Tweepi's plan, Twitter did not like what I was doing. Thank God I was able to get back on Twitter again but ever since I vowed I'd never have anything to do with any of these services. Also: (full disclosure) Tweepi reimbursed me in full after I cancelled on grounds of what happened. No harsh feelings there.Going back to the beginning - this book's title needs to be ""Twitter: It's Not Rocket Science - when using Tweepi"" (or something like that).

What is the product or experience I want to create or transform into a wow? The customerâs lobby experience. 2. How will the customer feel as a result of this experience? (In other words, what is the specific outcome we want to create?) The customer should feel we must be an extraordinary company because he has never had a lobby experience like this. He assumes we are somehow really different, and canât wait to experience more...""but beyond that it offers more - a lot more. After reading the book I realized that I needed a media kit (I had abandoned mine a while ago because it did not work); Hyatt's book offers excellent samples how to create one that will work better.The truly interesting factor about Hyatt's book is that seems to address information for newbies as well as information for authors who have already climbed the ladder, who have books to show. At first I was a bit irritated by this, then I realized the greatness of this concept.On one hand, the newbie author can use the book to get started, set up basics, but at the same time he can find out, where he should be going, what the ""final goal"" is. If you have started any kind of endeavor you know how important it is to plan ahead, if you do it right you can save time (and money) to correct errors that might happen ""along the journey.""Vice versa, the season author, for whom the more sophisticated elements of this book are written, can use the basic information to check if /she has set up all information correctly, if he or she covered all basics.That's the way I used it and I really like what I see.Hyatt also stresses an topic I have always believed in but I see many authors ignoring""...  No one is likely to do it if you donât. I wish this werenât the case, but for 95 percent of us it is. This is why you must take matters into your own hands.

"Frank  McCarthy's ""How Entrepreneurs Think: It's Never About The Money"" is a very neat book, only the title is somewhat misleading. While the reader might expect a scholarly book, this is a story book. Some titles of McCarthy's stories:1: A Call to Arms2: Painted Sticks3: Criticism is Confession Panel: The Junkyard Dog and the Poodle5: Leaving School to Get an Education Panel: How to Think Like an Entrepreneur7: The Omega Syndrome Panel: Itâs BrokenOne of the best stories in the book is SEEING WHAT OTHERS CANâT SEE. It tells how one of the author's friends,  Craig McKinney, set up his own bank in Dublin in 1978. At first, Craig wanted Trinity Bankâs client book merely so he could lease more cars to the clients. Turns out the bank building (undervalued at -50%) came with it. This is a particular neat story because it draws attention to the fact that entrepreneurs have to keep their eyes open - maybe there is more to the deal...I recommend the book based on that these are very unique stories (the painted stick story stands out in particular) but I disagree with the author's thought,""... âDo I want to be an entrepreneur, or donât I?â, this is the question you must ask yourself...""Personally I believe the entrepreneurs have to have a product or service (or a concept thereof) they believe in. You cannot only believe in yourself you have  to have a specific goal (even if that might change) too. McCarthy mentions Mark Zuckerberg a few times. Obviously, Zuckerberg had to have a vision of his product first before he became an entrepreneur.A very neat book,Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16ZPUBW2JGQPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXGEJS6#wasThisHelpful","R16ZPUBW2JGQPM","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Barb Drozdowich's book ""The Author's Guide to Working with Book Bloggers"" is an excellent book. Most importantly it explains that book bloggers are humans, who want to be approached like humans. Sadly, too many wishy-washy marketing blogs throw out slogans like ""Get your book featured by a book blogger"" or ""Take your book on a blog tour,"" which are slogans that suggest to the novice that that's all it takes.Well, of course it's not. While getting your book featured by a book blogger is not necessarily a science, there is a ""sweet science""  (am borrowing this word from boxing) to it - the little details that count. Authors need to observe the bloggers, see what they do, and align their own actions with what they see.Drozdowich also makes it very clear that there are no shortcuts to success and there are no magic bullets,""... You are looking at each blog to see if itâs somewhere you would want you and your book to be represented. Does it look like it is posted to on a regular basis? Are the posts neat and well-organized? If this blog posts reviews, read a few. Are they being respectful to authors in their reviews? Can readers leave comments easily?...""Like with everything else we do, doing the leg work pays off.Additionally, book bloggers are humans (not unpaid means to reaching a goal) and they want to be addressed in an appropriate manner. Drozdowich stresses the fact that authors should not waste bloggers ' time by providing too little or too much information. She provides helpful hints how to do it right.""... I will go the extra mile to help promote authors who are polite and personable, if I love their book. Find bloggers who love your book and they will go above and beyond to help. Also keep excerpts and guest posts short. I tend to skim right over the long onesâ donât have time to read it all. Donât be afraid to ask book bloggers for help. I mean, we do love to read. Personally, I love getting new opportunities to do new things for my blog...""All in all this is a must-read book for any author who does not have a huge budget to pay a book promoter and wants to take advantage of one of the best new opportunities  of the 21st century - the blogosphere.

"It is kind of really hard to say how good this product is, the effect could be different in different people. (This was my disclaimer). That being said after taking this product for more than two weeks I personally feel more energetic, even AFTER my work outs.Before I started testing the products I read up on it. Turns out that  CLAs (Conjugated linoleic acids) found mostly in the meat and dairy products derived from ruminants. Though I am not a vegetarian or a vegan I hardly ever eat beef, thus I figured it might be a good idea to take this supplement. Maybe that's also why I felt so better after my work out.Viva Labs, a very respected company, states that their CLA is ""naturally derived from 1,250mg non-GMO safflower oil in a highly absorbable form. Viva Labs ensures our safflower oil is standardized to a minimum of 80% CLA, maximizing potency and effectiveness of this scientifically proven healthy fat.""In general I like the idea of health product coming from plants because I believe that the purity of plant base products can be controlled easier; you can grow them in a greenhouse. I'll keep taking this product and see if maybe in time even some weight loss sets in. At this point I probably haven't taken it long enough.

When wearing the jeans (and sitting in them) for less than one hour the jeans stretch by two clothes sizes.Of the dozen pairs of white jeans I own this was the most expensive pair and it is also of the worst quality.

"To state this upfront, I received a sample of this product in return for an objective an unbiased review.To be honest I am not a health food fanatic but I am trying to live healthier by adding very healthy food to my diet. Organic Hemp Protein Powder makes it easy.I don't even own a blender; this product not require the use of a blender. When testing the product I first went the traditional route and tested the recipe the producer, Viva Labs, provides on the package - with a milk shake with added cocoa power. Since I love chocolate I loved it; it felt like ""drinking healthy chocolate.""Additionally, since it is summer, I also tested berries shakes. Mix a glass of milk with a good scoop of hemp protein powder and a cup of meshed berries and you are in for a treat. Personally I like raspberries best.Since I live a busy lifestyle, sometimes I am in a rush and don't have time to do anything even a bit time consuming, which is when I discovered that even only mixing the power itself with water produces a deliciously tasty drink with a distinctive nutty taste. If you like sweet drinks, you could like I do and add a spoon full of honey. In that case I first put the power into a regular 8 oz glass, added the honey, then added a bit of hot water (I have a water cooler that dispenses both, hot and cold water) and filled up with cold water. It's a fabulous starter drink in the morning!Lastly, I went a bit extreme and tried something new. I added a teaspoon of hemp protein powder to my morning coffee (black). The product gives coffee a fabulous nutty flavor.

"""The Entrepreneur's Blueprint to Massive Success: Create An Exceptional Lifestyle While Doing Business On Your Terms"" is not a bad book; it's just not what is says it is - there is no blueprint but basically mostly motivational pep-talk. As such this book resembles hundreds of other books on the market. To take one example, in chapter IX - If You Want To Change The Game, Change Your Value (I appreciated the Roman numerals) Peter Voogd writes,""... Simply put, if you're not happy with your current income level, it's not very complicated to change it.  You simply need to offer more value to the marketplace, and in order to do that you need to follow a self-development plan that will enable you to put your skills, your habits, and your new disciplines to work to increase your value to the marketplace...""I strongly object to the word ""simply"" or even more detailed, ""...you simply need to offer more value..."" - there is absolutely nothing simple about this process. For a better explanation readers are encouraged to read Seth Godin's ""Purple Cow,"" which details how complicated it is to produce a remarkable product (which would equate to ""more value""). The author goes on to write""...Is it possible to become twice as valuable to the marketplace?  Is it possible to make double the money in the same amount of time?  Yes.  My first summer, I ran a sales office.  I worked 80 hours a week and didnât make much money.  Five years later, I worked 20 to 25 hours a week and made six figures that summer.  How did this happen for me?  I became more intelligent, more valuable, more disciplined, gained new skills, and I was more aware as a leader.  That's why the time I spent working went down but the income went way up.  That shows you can sow your time and get anything you want because there's nothing more valuable than time invested wisely.  Nothing is more priceless than your time.  Never waste this precious gift.  I take my time very seriously, and so should you...""I bet, you, the reader, knew that. Voogd's solution is, ""Keep a diary, record your activities and time spent...""This is certainly not bad advice, but you would have figured that out, respectively you probably learned that when you were a teenager and one of your parents stuck his head through the door of your room and said, ""Are you wasting time by playing video games? What have you accomplished in these last two hours?""In other words, this book is not remarkable, it's just another one of these pep talk books. What I found much more irritating was, that as I wanted to put this book review online I noticed that the author had really penned two books. When I entered his name into the search field to post a 3*** review both books popped up. And, there I found a review of Voogd's book ""6 Months to 6 Figures"" by Miss Bonnie (August 29, 2015)""... This is a poorly written book with what I would guess are MANY fake reviews. NYT Bestselling books like I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi, has 300,000+ fans, has been on the market for 5 years and it has 600 reviews. This book by a relatively unknown author has 1,400??...""When I looked at ""6Months to 6 Figures"" it did not have ~1,400 reviews but only 444 reviews. It is no secret in the industry that over the last few months Amazon cleaned out fake reviews; obviously Mr. Voogd's other book had about 1,000 of them. Fake reviews don't just appear, somebody arranges to have them appear. And, that's not good business practices and puts a strange light on all of Mr. Voogd's work.  I'll still give this book 3 stars but with suspicions that somebody in Mr. Voogd's camp practices strange business practices. Are they supposed to lead to "" An Exceptional Lifestyle While Doing Business On Your Terms""?Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32PV35O5W7GO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990997324#wasThisHelpful","R32PV35O5W7GO1","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set aside Emily Hahn's addiction to opium smoking her biography tells of the life I would have liked to live. ""Mickey"" (Emily Hahn's nickname) lived her life the way she wanted to live it. She was the first woman to graduate  in mining, from the University of Wisconsin, in 1928. She traveled alone to the Belgian Congo and crossed Central Africa on foot. She traveled Africa, England and China at a time when women were supposed to stay at home and raise their children. I was not surprised to find out that she married a British spy, Charles Boxer. Obviously, no regular man would do.To me, most fascinating was how Emily Hahn made decisions for her life. After graduation she works as a geologist but does not enjoy the work. While she ponders whether she should stay or leave she hears about Charles Lindbergh's attempt to cross the Atlantic. At the time it is unclear if Lindbergh could even succeed; maybe he'd run out of fuel, maybe treacherous winds would blow him into the Atlantic, or the plane would blow up...Even though Mickey did not know anything about Lindbergh a few days earlier she ties their fates together.""... Suddenly I remembered what it day it was, and what news the day could bring - news with, I felt, a special message for me. During the night I had somehow made a decision: If Lindbergh had landed in France, it followed with logical progression - the same clear logic I knew existed in crystallography - that I was as free as he was, and therefore would quit my job. Of course, if he hadn't made it I would have to stay. Fair was fair.... My heart bounded. Sure enough, Lindbergh had settled it. I could quit...""Is it any wonder that a woman who applied this kind of logic, succeeded the way she did?Loved the book.

"Steve Salerno needs to be commended for gathering such a vast amount of material for this book.The part I personally like the most was the one about the self-esteem movement in America's schools. As someone, who attended Austria's (discriminating) tier school system at a time when it was considered to be the 8th best school system in the world, and also the mother of two American children, who attended American schools, I have thrown quite a few temper tantrum about the American school system. While, in 12th grade, I myself translated Pliny the Elder's work from the original (7 errors in a translation of 300 words earned ""barely a D"", 8+ errors earned an ""F"") my children talked about traditional garbs of Ancient Rome during their Latin classes. ( really ? ? ? ) Even though Latin was not my favorite subject I was outraged at how the supposedly excellent school did not offer a more rigorous curriculum.Quite fabulously, Salerno  offers Chicago teacher Mrs. Daugherty's story. Believing that she is cursed with a class of 6h grade students with learning disabilities, Mrs. Daugherty looks into her students' files to check their IQ scores while the principal is off premises. She ""discovers"" that most of her students' IQ scores are 120+, near genius level. She therefore concludes that it is ""her fault"" that the students  aren't learning. To make up for ""her failures"" Mrs. Daugherty imposes a rigorous curriculum, topped with vast amounts of homework and strict punishment for misbehavior. She achieves a 180 degree turnout. That surprises even the principal. When he asks Mr. Daugherty how she managed to succeed in such an impressive manner, Mrs. Daugherty confesses that she secretly looked up the IQ levels and then adjusted her teaching method accordingly.(quoting from SHAM) ""... Oh, by the way,"" he whispered as she turned around to retreat to her classroom, ""I think you should know: those numbers next to the kids' names? It's not their IQ scores. It's their locker numbers...""It's a brilliant story which illustrates the whole problem: Originally Mrs. Daugherty follows the adopted system of ""high expectations will automatically destroy the children's self-worth."" Only when Mrs. Daugherty believes (incorrectly) that she herself destroys these ""gifted"" kid's futures she imposes the toughest rules on (regular) children and (not surprisingly) succeeds.Sadly, Salerno does not really analyze Mrs. Daugherty's psychological state  of mind ; then again maybe it is not known.  At least to me it seems quite possible that Mrs. Daugherty too was a victim of SHAM and therefore acted the way she did.As for the rest of the book: Basically, the author makes his case that considering what vast amounts of money have been poured into self-help our society should see results, yet it doesn't. Instead we see a society depended on more self-help, which may not lead to anything.While I agree with many parts of this book, I do not agree with its portrayal of Oprah Winfrey. Also, while I believe that Tony Robbins can be found guilty of writing extremely long-winded and boring books, which lead to people buying his action loaded (and much more expensive) seminars, I do not believe that all people Salerno names in his book are in the same group of SHAM artists. This oversimplification of throwing all self-help experts in the same category takes away from the book.Still, the worst problem of the book is: What's the solution? Pointing out (major) flaws of a system is good but it should be complimented by a solution. If SHAM functions like a drug for its users (as Mr. Salerno kind of suggests) wouldn't a different powerful system be needed to ""wean off SHAM users""?Maybe Mr. Salerno will write a 2nd book describing alternatives.Gisela Hausmann, author  & blogger","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R480K4R9FYKXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCK71A#wasThisHelpful","R480K4R9FYKXM","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jane Franklin's humorous autobiography "" White Trash Odyssey: A Southern Journey"" is a master piece. Should you, the reader, not live in the South, you'll learn something, too. Southern humor is great, hysterical, and occasionally even - wise.The author is a master in presenting self-deprecating humor at its finest. It's the seeing the world from a humorous perspective that allows us to learn because we smile, grin, or even laugh hysterically in the process.Jane Franklin follows a chronological path beginning with childhood stories, with times when she ""listened in"" because children were supposed to be only seen but not heard.""... Once, my grandmother claimed a young man in church was singing âNero my little dog has fleas,â in instead of the hymn âNearer my God to Thee,â and the Lord made him keep singing it until he died. Even as a young person I thought that story was pretty suspicious. It would take a God with no sense of humor at all to do something like that. When I asked my grandmother where this incident happened, so I could go to the library and look up old newspaper accounts to learn more, she gave me a dirty look. My grandmother had over twenty grandchildren, but I think I was the only one who ever called bulls*** on her. She left me her wedding band when she passed away. I guess that she must have liked me after all..""She avoids no topic and writes about her dropping out of school but taking the GED, beginning to work, her various employers, and funny incidents at work. Most hysterical are the stories about Franklin's efforts to get a driver's license and really learning how to drive. The author also worked in logistics; since, in the past,  I did too, I love these stories. Side note: As a big fan of ""late-night-breakfasts"" at Waffle House I also enjoyed her Waffle House stories a lot."".... If youâve never been to a Waffle House your life will not be complete until you drop everything and go for a meal..."" At Waffle House, Franklin also meets her husband. And, in between, Franklin offers life's wisdom with Southern humor and Southern flair,""... When my momâs sister, who took care of grandma, went through her things there were drawers filled with new nightgowns and nice underwear that sheâd been saving. Can you imagine being that old and still thinking you should keep gifts, and wait until the right time to use them? I remember we were never allowed to go into grandmaâs front room as it was called. It had very nice furniture, but nobody ever sat on it. I think that is one reason I never wanted a formal living room. Why have things you are afraid to use and enjoy?...""And about reality shows and the wisdom to be found in one reality show in particular,""...""... In a way he was lucky. He could see he had huge balls. Many politicians are similarly encumbered, how else could you explain people working about six months out of twelve and calling other people takers?...""Finally, the author really shows her skills when she writes about her parents' death. Though she was a daddy's girl, it was her mother who gave her the best advice,""... For years my mother told me I should write, but I was busy raising kids and living my life. The best thing is, while I was doing all that living, I was also creating memories of things to write about. I wrote my first piece after a death but it turned out to be the beginning of a new life for me...""Did Franklin learn for the lessons she learned living her ""White Trash""-life?Ya' bet 'ya.""... Finally at the ripe old age of fifty-six I discovered the secret to writing; you just sit down and do it...""I sincerely hope author Jane Franklin is living up to this promise and writing a new book as I am writing this review. I will read her next book again, because Franklin has her way with words, and it's not ""white trash"" at all.Love it.

"It's a must read book for every marketer and every consumer. Marketers might be able to improve their performance, and consumer will understand why they do (and buy) what they do (and buy).Extremely significant is Godin's definition of the ""great story.""""... A Great story is true.""""Great Stories make a promise.""Great stories are trusted.""and""Great stories are subtle...""These four sentences define the scope. It' s not easy to reach by any marketer. And, consumers need to understand their own behavior better to ""... Know Your (their) power."" If consumers ""demand"" that marketers align their products with worthy goals, the world can move toward a better direction very quickly.I wished more marketers would read Godin's warning""It seems like an easy out. Figure out some internally approved story that you can trot out to the sales force and use in a magazine ad, and you're set.Actually, if you do that, you're dead...""I am always baffled how many stories which are trying to sell an expensive program begin with the story of some character, who is completely broke and has also maxed out his credit cards, but THEN borrows money to buy this program and ends up being a millionaire twelve months later.  Ha!Godin offers hundreds of interesting example, each one with valuable information whether you work in the particular industry or buy these products, or not. Marketing today is an ever more rapidly evolving process, and good marketing people learn cross industries. Even Steve Jobs learned from Nike.Finally, Godin hones down on what every consumer should think about before swiping the card: ""The lie a consumer tells himself is the nucleus in the center of any successful marketing effort.""This book  is highly recommended. In fact, it should be a must-read book for any HS-senior, to be read again five years later.Gisela Hausmann, author of the ""naked (meaning no-fluff) books","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXCYQUWCYKYAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591845335#wasThisHelpful","RXCYQUWCYKYAX","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Zeece Lugo starts out her book with dramatic flair. A young girl is about to meet her lover at their hide-out. When he does not show up, she âimmediatelyâ knows that he is dead â âlike the others.â Readers do not know who the girl is, who âthe others killedâ are and why they got killed. Author Zeece Lugo proves that she is a master of suspense; the short chapter grabs the readerâs attention.A few years later the village of Daniel's Fork and surrounding province gets a new Lord. Lord Tanis, who rules like a king over all provinces has appointed the savvy warrior ââ¦William the Gorgeous, respectfully addressed by his men as Commander Evers, and now to be addressed by all as Lord Eversâ¦â Though all of Daniel's Forkâs females are excited to meet the new Lord, Setiyah the Healer is not. She thinks William is too young, too inexperienced, and âtoo beautifulâ.However, there is not much time to delve into this, on his second evening in town William the Gorgeous takes a closer look at Susanna, the only daughter of the main pubâs owner. The reader gets to find out that she is the girl from the opening chapter. Every man she loves gets killed in the most hideous way. The suspect is Alex Neville, a cattle farmer. Everybody believes him to be the killer, though nobody can prove that Alex has done anything. While others worry about Williams safety, Williams realizes that he needs to find the killer. Just taking over a new province he cannot tolerate a killer on the loose. Though he does not like it, he also needs to reconnect with Setiyah, becauseââ¦ She can tell you far more than anyone can, for our old lord confided everything to her. She can tell you all he discovered, and the reasons why the man is still free and unhindered. She can also tell you about other deaths, years back when Susie was but a young girl, that have not been accounted to him.â âOh, God, no!â groaned William. âNot another trip to the healer. I'd rather eat rocks. She flings insults at me, uses sarcasm, and berates me as if I am a not-too-bright first grader.âStill, concerned about his regency William talks to Setiyah. Learning as much as anybody can know he begins laying a trap. However, the plan does not work out, the killer does not come after William but kills Susannaâs father.Though from the beginning I suspected that Alex is not the killer, I had no clue, who the real killer is. The only reason why I thought that Alex could not be it was that this authorâs suspenseful writing indicates that she had more in store for the reader. Alex Neville being the killer would have been too easy. No spoilers from this reviewer; the only thing I will say is that Zeece Lugo has written a very nice show-down scene.The story is developed very nicely, the characters have depth. I really liked Zeece Lugoâs descriptions of how Setiyah and William learn to cooperate and see the best in each other. It makes the story and goes beyond the usual action stuff.The story also includes a few steamy sex scenes, which entertain in between the drama.Itâs a very entertaining book, the ending lets me suspect that more books are to come.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22726AN0KQ97S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5GVA0I#wasThisHelpful","R22726AN0KQ97S","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jeff Benningtonâs âThe Author's Guide to Publishing Successâ is great book for indie authors. Though at times it feels a bit unorganized this is exactly why it feels like âexperiencing indie authorsâ livesâ. Indie authors try, reevaluate, change course, experience rejection AND unexpected encouragement â the process cannot be charted like getting from point A to point B.In the words of the author,ââ¦I find myself constantly tweaking my book blurbs, covers, and sales pages, and sending digital copies out to reviewers. I spend time doing these things because, as I said earlier, what works one day may not work the next. But thatâs why indie publishing is so great. If your book cover is bad, you fix it. If your book blurb isnât catchy, you change it. If your price is too high, you lower itâ¦âBennington does an excellent job explaining that indie publishing is a fluid process; he offers encouragement and solid advice,ââ¦  The publishing business has changed. Indie authors need to think differently, adjust faster, and stay on top of technology. We need to write the best stories we can, get them professionally edited, get a great cover, and get them out the door, formatted for e-books. We need to consistently churn out great reads and stop wasting time with the traditional methodsâ¦âand he explains that indeed these processes are DOABLE. His book is testimonial to the courage of all, who try,ââ¦Indie authors are in the trenches. We are battle-hardened warriors who have had to endure the scars of rejection, ascending the depths of failure over and over again, fighting tooth and dirt-filled nail on our way to publication. As a result, weâve read every book on style, marketing, HTML, advanced blogging, and social media. Weâve paid to self-publish, discovered the faults of vanity presses, and mastered the art of publishing e-books and print books with the business finesse of Jack Welch. We are starting our own publishing companies and living our dreams without the help of the big sixâ¦âBeyond that this author offers advice, recommends websites, and newsletters. The chapter âWhy My Writing Sucked and What I Did to Fix Itâ offers encouragement and solid tips to those who hear that they just werenât born to be writers. Since I am a boxing fan I truly appreciated the authorâs analogies of âRocky Balboa, the underdogâsâ plot. In particular interesting is also the chapter about blog tours. Bennington shares his entire data, which new authors will find very helpful. Also outstanding his information AND advice about pricing. ââ¦ My final thoughts on pricing: Price your book(s) to make money and gain readers, not to feed your egoâ¦â Equally helpful and probably extremely interesting to every author, seasoned or new, is the chapter about book covers. I really loved the side by side comparisons of the cover of the book âDeath Roadâ.All in all â Indie authors should read this book. To go to Benningtonâs philosophy, indie authors never know when the find the trick that works for them. Indie publishing is very much about adjusting daily.Highly recommended,Gisela Hausmann, author  & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DBJFRH8BDQU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007D0HTFE#wasThisHelpful","R3DBJFRH8BDQU4","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fabulous tasting - healthy - this product should be in everybody's kitchen.I like chocolate a lot, however, having read recently, the the chocolate we eat, is not the chocolate I used to eat when I was a child (additives, additives, additives... ) actually had me cut back. That was, until I discovered ""Raw Organic Cacao Nibs"". It's SUPER FOOD!Since I am not too much of a cook I sprinkled the nibs over my cereal which I consume in the morning, every dessert (especially ice cream), and I can vouch for that the nibs go with everything. I really like that the are not too sweet, thus do not alter the taste of other foods.However, eventually I found the best application for me.  I really drink a lot of coffee. Though at first I sprinkled the nibs on whipped cream floating on my coffee, I eventually figured out that the nibs are small and light enough to float on coffee. You don't have to use whipped cream (as a raft). Most of the nibs will float. Absolutely fabulous. I showed it to my girlfriends - they love it too.What a great and healthy way to turn your coffee into one of these hotshot designer coffees!!!!I received a sample of the product in return for an honest and unbiased review.Highly recommended! 5 starsGisela Hausmann, author  & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R395HDTKWT4KIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGW81YM#wasThisHelpful","R395HDTKWT4KIE","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Devinder Dhimanâs book âLines of Spaceâ begins with the description of a situation many parents are familiar with â his son does not like to study physics (and he hates chemistry). Though son Sahil excels in mathematics, he wants to have nothing to do with the other sciences.Devinder realizes the problem and awakens his sonâs interest.ââ¦ Imagine about four hundred years ago when there was no knowledge of elements,â I continued. âPeople were only familiar with the objects they observed such as air, sand, iron, gold, copper, water, fire, and the sky. So they envisioned that only five elements constituted the whole universe namely air, water, fire, earth, and sky. And every other substance could be created from these five basic constituents.â âThen how did the other elements came to be known?â Sahil asked, as he now seemed a little interested.Showing the historic development is always a good idea because it makes the student feel âin chargeâ or âin controlâ because he knows things people did not know a few hundred years ago. A few laughs canât hurt and this author goes on to write,ââ¦ Iâll tell you one incident. Once a physics teacher was explaining to his students that there exist only those things that we can register by using our sense organs: eyes, ears, skin, nose; just as you are saying that things donât exist if you canât see, hear, feel or smell them,â I told Sahil. â¦ âThen one of the students got up and asked his class-mates whether anyone had seen, heard, touched or smelt the teacherâs brain?â âNoâ everybody replied. âThen it implies that our teacher does not have a brain,â the student reasoned and all his classmates laughedâ¦ âââ¦ Do you want to know who that student was?â I asked Sahil. âYou mean to say that this incident was true?â he asked in surprise. âYes, I think so. The student in this incident was Albert Einstein,â I told himâ¦âI think it is fair to say that at this point author Devinder Dhiman has readers hooked. As the story evolves Devinderâs daughter gets hooked too, and even he himself takes the opportunity to delve deeper into questions he had for a long time; his sonâs questions bring them up again.I love d this authorâs simply and easy examples leading to bigger questions like, if , ââ¦ practically homogeneous milk-cream could be separated into two parts by simply providing energy to it by churning, why couldnât the homogeneous space be separated into different parts when energy is supplied or removed from it?...âAnd, his âMarching soldiersâ analogyâ (with illustrations) for the bending of light due to refraction.The book also gets philosophical,ââ¦ When you donât know something, then just say, God knows,â I made a point to him. âYou are suggesting that God is equivalent to unknown.â âMay be,â I replied, as I didnât know the answerâ¦â  Fitting to the authorâs style, he does not rule anything he does not know. Therefore, unless it can be proven that God does NOT exist, h is not going to rule out this thought.While this is not a recreational read I believe that a lot of readers can benefit immensely from reading this book. For instance, if you were asked about Einsteinâs Theory of Relativity, could you explain it in one sentence and simple terms? Did you ever understand it, when your physicsâ professor talked about it, in school?This author delivers.ââ¦ Space and time as per Einstein are not flat but can be pushed and pulled, stretched and warped by matter.

"Absolutely LOVE these Goji Berries. I only found out about them now, I had no idea that a super fruit exists which promotes cellular defense against the effects of free radicals.As suggested on the package I tried the berries with various cereals. But I did not like that the other ingredients taste interfered with the delicious taste of the goji berries.Finally I found what is the perfect way to eat them, for me. I sprinkle about 2 spoon full of berries over 8 ounces of Greek yoghurt and add 1 tea spoon honey. Itâs a breakfast fit for champions â not too sweet and tastes completely healthy, yet healthy in a sensual kind of way. I am not too fond of health food that tastes like health food (in a boring kind of way), I appreciate good food. They berries themselves are quite big. The berries are bigger than dried cherries.I have traveled the Himalayas many years ago, and while I did not eat them there, I am exited to have found the berries here. 5 StarsI received a sample of the product in return for an honest and unbiased review.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3UXRBFH23BT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWW3LQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3UXRBFH23BT","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though I hardly ever do, I âstumbledâ over this book; it was prominently displayed at my library, where I was really looking for another book. The title is catchy so I grabbed it but I expected something else.âWinning the Rat Raceâ is a really interesting book, which drew my attention to something I had never thought about â that indeed there way how can negotiate in better ways if we consider the other personâs âpositionâ, in his her birth order. Myself a classic middle child, a born negotiator, who eventually ended up in a first child position because I left my three siblings and moved to another country I was familiar with Adlerâs work, but had never thought about that this knowledge could be used to become a better sales person, boss, or co worker. Author Dr. Kevin Leman provides clues how to recognize the business partnerâs position and how adjust oneâs approach. And, wouldnât you know it, I also have a friend who is a pilot, who was even a chief pilot of a major route; and like Leman writes, this gentleman is a first born child of seven.I enjoyed reading the book as it gave me a whole new perspective and I would recommend this book to everybody, who deals or has to deal with a lot of people.5 starsGisela Hausmann, author of the 'naked' â no fluff â books and blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFITEY2ALS8PM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0840734913#wasThisHelpful","RFITEY2ALS8PM","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""I.T. Geek to Farm Girl Freak"" is a fabulous book, especially in times like these. This book is a follow up book to Sherry Molteni's book, ""Her Name was Half-Calf"", which I read some time ago. While the news  on the internet make us believe that the majority of people is yearning to live the lifestyle of the rich and famous, whose wardrobe and houses we can see now up close Sherry Molteni shows us the charm of living with nature and animals, up close and personal.The interesting thing is Molteni makes a 180 degrees change to get to this junction. She worked in IT in a high midlevel position; thus, for her, rearing baby cows (Jersey cows and Angus cows), chicken, bunnies, hens and adopting Jasmine the dog, who is supposed to watch the animals is anything but the good old of anything. My favorite story in the book, is  ""the Chicken and the Eggs"". It all begins with a phone call from an annoyed postmaster and ends with beautiful hens. I was particularly thrilled to find confirmation that these organic eggs taste differently than what stores sell. I have been saying for a long time that foods used to taste differently when I was a child. Now I found confirmation from an expert who knows.Readers will be delighted to read about cows  , Sweet Pea, the duckies, Tom-Tom, Tyler and Tanner, and so many other animals. Molteni has added pictures, which show the adorable bunch. I would be surprised if the book would not make a few readers wonder, if they should not up for a life on a farm.Loved it.Gisela Hausmann, author of the 'naked' â no fluff â books and blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BJ66NFQ4WCMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VZI0BUK#wasThisHelpful","R2BJ66NFQ4WCMV","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If your doctor has told you that you need to eat more ballast food, you should consider trying out ""Whole Grain Quinoa"".  I learned that opposite to other grains quinoa is relatively low on the glycemic index. Whatever that is eating this quinoa is not only healthy it is also a delicious way to go about eating healthier.Firstly I need to point out that I do NOT cook any longer, meaning that I do not cook anything fancy (no Thanksgiving and Christmas turkeys at this house). If I cook at all I want to get the biggest bang for the buck. As an expert in this form of cooking I can vouch for that ""Whole Grain Quinoa"" delivers just that. The âcooking processâ is as easy as described. Add one of the rinsed quinoa to two cups of water; bring all to a boil and simmer for 15 minutes. Voila â finished. (It takes about the same effort as boiling an egg. ) That portion is big enough to be served as the side dish for four people. It tastes fantastic. Like âextra special rice for the rich and famousâ with a slightly nutty taste. The quinoa is fluffy and even looks decorative.Highly recommended, especially to people who âdonât cookâ and for people, who want to enjoy eating healthier food.

"Suffering from insomnia Thomas OâShea  drives around Rockbluff, Iowa  in the middle of the night and â notices  the body of a dead young woman floating in a river; at closer look reveals that she is a young girl with âvery dark hair, but there was a patch of white on the left side, looked kind of like a Nike swoosh.â  It will turn out that the girl is  Thomasâ friendâs Moonâs niece, Cynthia Stalking Wolf, an Ojibwa Indian.Things take off quickly after the dead girl is found. Surprisingly, the coroner does not report that she was shot twice in the back of the head, which makes suicide an impossibility, yet that âs what the coroner finds - that the originally nameless victim drowned herself. Shortly thereafter, the body of the girl, the coronerâs report, and even the coroner himself and his wife disappear. Thatâs enough to get Thomas going even though a blizzards is bearing down on Rockbluff, Iowa.Though finding a dead person would be a rare event in most peopleâs lives, it isnât for Thomas. Others comment,ââ¦ This is like that old TV series, âMurder, She wrote.â I learned one thing from watching those reruns: stay away from Jessica Fletcher-whereever she goes, murder follows. And youâre just like her.âIn reality, Thomas is anything but like J.B. Fletcher. During his training to become a navy seal he broke his leg twice, which forced him out of training. Still, whenever Thomas encounters murder (like J.B. Fletcher) he brings what he has learned to the table. I must say, I liked Thomas OâShea, a lot.If one spends enough time in the company of around fifty year old women, one gets to hear sooner or later, âAhhâ¦, I watched a movie with John Wayne (or Gary Cooper). They just donât build that type of man anymore (sigh~~~)â. Tom OâShea is a modern day John Wayne or Gary Cooper. Young women under the age of twenty five would not even know what type of man this is.ââ¦ I am conservative when it comes to trusting people. The three people I trusted with my life are all dead, so there you go.âThomas is also funny,âActually, youâre the guest here. You ate my food and drank my ale.ââThe way you say that, âYou ate my food and drank my aleâ sounds very intimate, as if there is some sort of propriertary relationship here. Man. Woman. Food. What could possibly follow?ââDessert?âSuzanne laughed, and it was genuine. Itâs cool when I can make beautiful women laughâ¦.âThomas says a lot of things a modern day John Wayne would say; like I said, I liked the man/character,ââ¦ Then there I was, probably the only white guy in town starting to channel General George Armstrong Custer. I thought of the Chinese curse, âMay you live in interesting times. âMoon stopped just as he put his hand on the door and looked at me and said, âWhy are you smiling white eyes?ââAdrenalin,â I said, âBody fluid of champions.âOpposite to modern movie heroes, but very much like good old day movie heroes, Thomas is even in love; but while this reader suspected early that Thomas will solve the case,  I was not so sure that he would get the girl.The quest to solve the murder will bring Thomas into a world of cheap tribal casinos, illegal prostitution, including sex slavery. Quite a few strong words will be exchanged, additionally to John Wayne like throwing of fists.âA Far Gone Nightâ delivers much more than a murder mystery; it introduced me to a world where I had never visited. I also truly enjoyed the subtle humor, which I did not expect. 5 stars! As for myself, I am going to have to find out, where else Thomas visits â¦ and, undoubtedly will encounter murder again.Gisela Hausmann, author of the 'naked' â no fluff â books and blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I19X2LENN7RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUU4AOO#wasThisHelpful","R3I19X2LENN7RJ","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love the product and have recommended it already to many of my friends.It use this bird netting to cover my young blueberry bushes. It works perfectly. Not even the two storms we have had since it installed the netting, blew it off. I am very happy with this product.However, special attention should be given to how you place the sections, which hang over your frame. I did it wrong. I merely stretched the net over my lattice fence elements and left it at that. I certainly did not want to trim off pieces; after all, I hope that the berry bushes will grow taller.Unfortunately a black racer snake must have decided to take the âshortcut through the nettingâ, and wiggled herself more and more into the netting. She strangled herself. I regret this because these snakes are excellent natural pest control, they hunt mice.Having learned from this I now roll up the extra netting material so that is not going to happen again. Besides that it is sad that the snake strangled herself, it is also really unpleasant, discovering a 4 foot dead snake in the morning, especially when one is still a little tired and does not recognize that the snake is dead, after first glance.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18YX7F03F8DBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004RA0O#wasThisHelpful","R18YX7F03F8DBL","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It appears this entire book is written around the idea that the buyer/reader gets a free gift ( a book about wedding photography -Thatâs kind of NOT amazing because if you compare the opportunities to use techniques for taken pictures at weddings with taking pictures of most other special or ordinary event, typically weddings donât come up on top.

"This is an interesting book for people who have been wondering about what sours the sweetness of sugar.The facts are clear, everybody knows them and can see the effects when congregating with people anywhere.ââ¦ Many people canât get through half a day, let alone an entire day without consuming sugar in one form or anotherâ¦âAuthor Robert Lalondeâs book quotes numbers - that the average American consumes about  152 pounds of added sugar per year, though it seems lately this number has been adjustedâ¦ to 76.7 pounds. I for one am suspicious about these numbers when it comes to sugar. Obviously if somebody wanted to find out how much coffee the average American drinks, that organization needed to find out how much coffee was sold at every outlet that sells coffee beans to private shoppers and commercial organizations, then do a couple of surveys, to figure how many people can  do without coffee,  and figure it out. This number could be more or less precise by either looking at the numbers of sold coffee (beans and ground) only,  or also to include a number  for the coffee which might get turned into coffee flavoring (if there even is any real coffee in these foodsâ¦)But, what about sugar? Itâs in almost everything. The other day I read that  corn syrup can even be found in flavoured milk,  and other foods, in which you wouldn't expect it, like Stouffer's French Bread Pizza. I have stopped eating ketchup years ago, precisely for that reason.  I want to eat ketchup made from tomatoes not corn. If thatâs not available I  can do without this condiment.So, how does one add these numbers, of all sugar which is added to any kind of foods?  It might be almost impossible, but one thing is certain, - the  huge number of sources leaves ample room for  (potentially) manipulating statistics.Even if it true that Americans consume only 76.7 lbs of added sugar per year,  somebody out there must be eating about 130 pounds of sugar because I donât even have any at my house. I use sweetened coffee creamer (the flavored kind) but no sugar whatsoever. And, I have stopped drinking soda altogether almost two decades ago.Reading Robert Lalondeâs book I was wondering if this is the secret to my health. He writes, â First sugar compromises the immune function of the body. Just two cans of soda contain over 18 teaspoons of sugar and thatâs enough to reduce the efficiency of white blood cells by 90 percent for up to five hours.âLalonde concludes, âIf you happen to be exposed to a virus or bacteria within five hours of drinking two colas, your immune system would be unable to fight off the invader. âMy friends know it â I havenât been sick in years. Is that because I avoid sugar at all costs?I think everybody should read this book to form his or her own opinion.Gisela Hausmann, author  & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1A4DA6Q66UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W92ZLXI#wasThisHelpful","RB1A4DA6Q66UD","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loved this book. It is the absolutely most complete book about greenhouse gardening I have ever read.  That being said, I would have liked to see a couple of pictures to illustrate the process but thatâs because I am a visual person and I like to illustrate my own books myself.Firstly, the author, Eric Beuning , cover the topic of choosing the readerâs best option for a greenhouse in his environment as well as essentials like heating, water, and ventilation. She includes the things people donât commonly think about, like,ââ¦ If it is a particular warm and sunny day you will probably want to deploy some form of screeningâ¦.â Dawwwâ¦ Right!!!

Otherwise weâll fry the young plants.And also,ââ¦ A properly tended greenhouse is essentially its own little ecosystem. On the one hand itâs handy, that compared to your garden, random bugs, fungal spores and soil borne diseases have a hard time getting in. Unfortunately once they do get in they tend to run wild in the greenhouseâs special conditions!ââ¦âAhhhâ¦ never thought about that! How does it work?ââ¦ One of the easiest ways for things to get into your greenhouse is on your shoes or toolsâ¦âThese few short quotations illustrate already how intelligently this book is written.

"I really appreciated this book because it presented a few great concepts we donât see too often. After the sudden passing of her husband Livvy has a bit too much time on her hands. Not wanting to hang around her children she is looking for things to do. Just spending time with her girl friends is not enough.ââ¦ Helping choose a mother of the bride dress fell to me. I thought I had lucked out. After all what could be so complicated about finding an appropriate dress for a winter wedding?I sat with Judy for hours, looking through magazines, looking online, even trying to design a dress she would like. There were moments when I thought I would screamâ¦âSuddenly fascinated with the anniversary of the Kennedy assassination she decides to visit Dallas. Her late husbandâs best friend and neighbor Bill first does not want her to go and finally wants to tag along since Livvy insists. As they start their trip it becomes more and more obvious that Bill knows things he does not want to tell. The trip brings them closer together, Livvy falls in love with Bill; eventually she even finds out who Bill really is.  Since I donât do spoilers I am not going to spell it out.Besides the romance between two senior citizens this revelation is the second unusual topic. As the title reveals this book revolves around the Kennedy assassination but opposite to thetypical stories, about the charismatic young president, the conspiracy theories, possible mafia connections, this book focuses on a âwhat if?â and âHas anybody thought about this?â scenario that one never gets to read about.This is a very entertaining book. Side note: I loved Judyâs character. What a riot the woman is! I was smitten with the plot, the love story, and the humane views author Elizabeth Horton-Newton presents.

"Itâs an interesting book that I would recommend to indie authors.Though much of the book is common knowledge among indie authors I think it is always a good idea to check up on what other experts suggest.Personally I liked author  Penny C. Sansevieriâs  elaborations about searching for keywords best. Though I knew about how to search Amazonâs categories, I had never heard of  âÃbersuggestâ. The entire chapter is well researched, excellently illustrated, and very interesting. I believe that the more the Internet advances the more important is all kinds of information about keywords, googling etc. because letâs face it, these processes get more automatized, author need to know how it works.However, I totally disagree with  this authorâs email template for book review requests. Three of four sentences begin with the word âIâ, thatâs just not good e-mail writing. Also, as an Amazon top reviewer I can say with certainty that no reviewer or blogger cares about the name of the publisher. To any reviewer the most important information is info about the book. The phrase âYou can learn more about my bookâ¦â is not well chosen. When I receive emails like this I think, âHow about you tell me? You are the author. Please donât make me work.â Authors need to understand the reviewerâs point of you. Top reviewers get anywhere from 1-200 review request per day; they do not have the time to scan between 1-200 webpages to find out whatâs special about an authorâs book. The author is supposed to tell the reviewer.Most OUTSTANDING is the chapter âThank you for readingâ. Just today I talked to an author who said, she never thought about that. ânuf said, itâs extremely relevant.Penny C. Sansevieri completes this book with an detailed description of goodreads. Since I keep hearing from authors that they have trouble with goodreads this chapter may be among the most valuable in this book.The book contains also a very nice directory of websites where authors can post their books. Though not all genres are covered I think itâs very well done.Though every author already knows that doing everything thatâs mentioned in this book wonât turn your book into a 24/7 sales machine, every author should do all of the mentioned or his/her book will be buried among the millions of other eBooks, completely.

"This could be a great book and if I ripped out the last few pages in my opinion it would be still a great book.The author Carl Nordgren tells his friend Steve Fobisterâs story; Steve is an Anishinaabe Indian. When Steve was a young boy he discovered Santa in an Eatonâs mail order catalogue. He decorated a tree thinking that Santa would come and bring him gifts. The disappointing experience that that did not happen is told in a sweet loving way every reader will be able to associate with. Steveâs people do not believe in Santa or Christmas, they call the Great Creator Gitche Manitou and they are NOT disappointed that Santa did not bring them any gifts. Steveâs grandfather tells him that he does not understand the white manâs spirit, and that the white man did not get the gifts Gitche Manitou has given his people. Steve grandfather tells Steve the story of the blue sky and Anungâs Journey (looking for the greatest chief of all the First Nations people). It is a beautiful story, appreciating the beliefs and stories of Native Americans as well as beautiful descriptions of a natural habitat, which in part has already been destroyed. Anung gets to meet many other Indian tribes on his journey. The author does a superb job in describing these tribesâ ways of living.ââ¦It was late in the summer and the great spirit of Waabanong covered the bushes with blueberries. This is what they ate as they walked onâ¦âAnd later,ââ¦Each net they used to fish the great salt lake what stretched the sky was longer than all of the Odawaâs nets sewn together.They carved great canoes from the biggest trunks of the tallest treesâ¦âAnd laterââ¦Off a rocky point men in smaller canoes were pulling in their nets filled with fish. If so many people could be in one place Anung wondered at the number of fish living in this great salt lakeâ¦.âThe book describes many different tribes way of living, hunting, dressing, eating; for students it is a beautiful way to learn about many of the Indian tribes. Every reader will appreciate author Carl Nordgrenâs masterful storytelling.Loved the book till page 105. It turns out the greatest chief is the Christ child.Personally, I do not believe that mixing up cultural elements has positive effects for any or all societies. It is not cool that Santa âhas taken overâ and is riding on his sleigh through Asiaâs and Africaâs stores (that is an invention of corporations, who want to use the same marketing materials all over the world). Equally, Indian tribes did not believe in the Christ child and therefore it should not be the final highlight of this story. I have visited at Apache, Hopi, Cherokee, and Seminole reservations and listened to these tribesâ stories. The Christ child never came up. Cultural heritage has to be saved as a whole and in my humble opinion authors should help this process.In short â itâs a great read till page 105 (paperback).

"Loved it â itâs really not a story that makes a lot of sense â but it has a powerful quality of âlove overcomes all hurdlesâ!Most importantly âThe Toughskin Rhinoceros Wrangler Companyâ describes rhinoceroses as lovable creatures. Children will be able to relate to the bookâs hero, Jack, who loves rhinoceroses, consequently they love him back and â dance! The concept that love is so powerful that it would prompt these heavy animals to dance, is just beautiful.  The bookâs illustrations are charming and bound to excite young readers. The book is complete with facts about rhinoceroses, that children will want to know after having read this charming story.This book should be sold in very zooâs gift shop.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SG46V8OHOQ1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXRWQH4#wasThisHelpful","R2SG46V8OHOQ1O","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a reviewer I am known for ignoring little problems, I have lots of understanding for tiny errors and would not dare to criticize the work of an indie author, who may have overlooked the one or other typo when he penned his book in long night hours. I am even more generous with formatting issues. This book however is a JOKE.When I pulled it up on my Kindle, Wi-Fi, 6"" I was immediately irritated by the formatting. The names of most authors are displayed âfirst nameâ, on the right side of the page, under the quote, the last name shows up the left.âPut all excuses aside and remember this: YOU are capable.â...Zig Ziglar's first name is displayed on the right side...  ZigZiglar (on the left)This book is not formatted for quotes, meaning that many quotes will be at the bottom of one page and the name of the quoteâs author at the top of next page; which looks particularly weird if the first name of the quote's author is displayed on the right hand side and the last name on the left hand side.Thatâs just not a proper way to format a quote book. Since this book was published in 2010, the author had ample opportunity to correct this mistake in the event that his formatter made the mistake.Still, since my Kindle is a cheaper model and I thought that maybe my Kindle is the problem. Thus I pulled up the book  on my computer monitor, only to find out that a considerable number of quotes still contain the link to ThinkExist.com. It appears the author copied the quotes form there and did not remove the hyperlinks. Also, again, the names are not formatted properly.Since the author also quotes himself:âHe who tries always succeedsâ  Michael OduahI suggest he starts with re-formatting this book.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17QOSXQZCC4EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H1TUJ0#wasThisHelpful","R17QOSXQZCC4EP","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Itâs a must read book for readers who are interested in history, adventure, the northern âWild Westâ, memoirs o r just a plain good story.This book is amazing. It begins innocently enough with Bill Collins coming home from college and getting talked into going to Alaska by his friend Rupe Arnell.ââ¦ I could sure use a job. I had spent a lot of money at college. Theyâd had a typhoid epidemic and I was unfortunate enough to get sick after the infirmary was filled up. Iâd had to pay my own hospital bills. And there was nobody at home. It was a puzzlement. Rupe was mighty convincingâ¦âAnd from there on this book takes off. It tells of adventures we cannot imagine anymore in our interconnected world. The young men work any job they can get, picking up scrap metal, loading ships, and working different jobs in the railroad workersâ camp. Quite a few disputes are getting settled the good old fashioned way; luckily Bill boxed in school and always comes out on top. Alaska attracts all kinds of interesting people and there arenât only Americans but Russians, Swedes, Finns, Italians (cooks) â¦ men, who seek the adventure and wanted to make money.Also interesting and beautiful are the descriptions of the landscapes. As a dedicated environmentalist I wonder if it is still like this.ââ¦ In Alaska at the time of year it was daylight most of the night. In fact you could see all night. When we got through with our work and our supper, Iâd go out, wander around, and look at the country.  One time I walked over a hill and I looked for, gosh, a mile or so either way and there were ripe red raspberries all over the place. I couldnât believe it. They were apparently native to that countryâ¦.âThis book features too many adventures to even touch on all. I cannot imagine a person, who begins reading this book and would not want to finish reading it. Also featured is the famous story of the man, who, when planes could not fly in icy conditions, did the double run with his dog team, bringing the vaccine to Nome, AK to stop the diphtheria epidemic.His experiences shape Bill and he falls in love with the country. He is not that interested anymore in attending college to become an engineer. Side note: His story of how he and his buddy wire up a hotel in Alaska so itâll have a 25V bulb in every room, is hysterical.I wished I had been there, with Bill, when he saw his first Orca, I have always wanted to see one.Loved this book!Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262667OOZLCXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKVYEGY#wasThisHelpful","R262667OOZLCXB","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OMG, I did not realize it when I bought the book but âDelicious Meals For 1.22 Eurosâ contains all my favorite European foods, many of which I have not eaten in years. That alone would be reason for every European expat to buy this book. I really bought  it because a friend had told me that Kat Millerâs cooking book featured  e a s y  recipes, and they are. And like my friend said, the book is designed for those of us, who do not consider themselves hobby cooks (e.g. me). I loved that this author took the effort of showing pictures of intermediate steps. She writes,âMix all the ingredients together until you have formed a consistent mixture as soâ¦â => [picture]Thatâs clever and easy.So far the only recipe I have cooked is the âJacket Potato â Vegetarian versionâ  - of course, it came out great, itâs a fabulous dish. Beware, if you have a convection oven like I do, baking the potatoes takes less time.On the weekend I am going prepare Italian Potato Gnocchis. This is going to be my big cooking project of this quarter. I am planning to prepare and freeze at last 10 portions, because making gnocchis does take work. But gnocchis are HEAVENLY food which have to be made from scratch. I have tried various store brands, none of them is any good. Thus, I want to freeze a few portions so I have them at hand when my children come for a visit.In general I did not focus on the cost-value aspect as much as a mother of four kids would. However, one recipe excited me â the Veggie Burger! If you have ever eaten at a vegetarian restaurant or a âWhole Foodsâ restaurant, you know what these places charge for one veggie burger. Reading Kat Millerâs book I had to find out that that the costs for one burger are only  0.65 Euros. ânuf said, those will be next.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R87XGF39LAR59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D42C6Q2#wasThisHelpful","R87XGF39LAR59","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"âDonât sweat the Vetâ is a short but very complete book written by two sisters; one is a writer, the other a vet.The book relates valuable information with regards toâ¢ selecting a veterinarianâ¢ preparing  for visits (regular visits as well as emergency visits) andâ¢ clearing up common myths, e.g. that dental cleanings are NOT âthatâ important for your pet.The book is very nicely done and complete; The authors had a great way of presenting old topics in a new lightââ¦Itâs astonishing how many people understand the necessity for a yearly physical for themselves or their children but donât seem to feel it should be necessary for their pet. While some cynics view an animal doctorâs insistence on an annual checkup as a way to ensure business, itâs actually the best way for a vet to detect a problem before it become serious. The checkup also provides future benchmarks for comparison so a doctor can learn, for example, if thereâs a change in weight or blood chemistry. Remember too that animals age much more rapidly than humans, so a lot can changeâ¦â (I take my cats to yearly check-ups, but I have never heard it put so nicely as in the quoted paragraph.]I loved the many hysterical pet pictures, which help to make the topic lively and the book âlongerâ. [I also appreciated that the authors took the time to list all picture credits in the back, very nicely.]  The book is too short, as it is it is probably more of a booklet than a book. Since one of the sisters is a vet and the other a writer I suggest adding some lively pet stories.Disclosure: - I received a copy of this book in return for an honest review.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GKRQPUHXAFQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDODAAY#wasThisHelpful","R2GKRQPUHXAFQ7","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"âEasy, Lean & Healthy - The ELH Diet: The Easy Way to be Lean and Healthyâ his is an excellent book, everybody should read it. Personally, I am going to go shopping with my Kindle for while, until I know how to âread the labelsâ by heart .Here is the catch: I really donât want to lose a lot of weight (maybe tighten a few pounds) but I looked into this book because I have become highly suspicious of the American food industry. By mathematical odds it just does not make sense that so many people in the United States are obese and itâs all their fat genesâ fault and their parentsâ fat genesâ fault and their life stylesââ¦. Therefore, being the Sherlock Holmes I am, I began to suspect that the food we eat has a lot to do with this obesity epidemic.A while ago I came to the conclusion that certain interests (or players) donât care about certain details, whether people smoke, donât smoke, have quit smokingâ¦. Since everybody needs to eat why not make (at least certain) foods addictive and forget about that inconvenient tobacco businessâ¦ (too many lawsuits â¦)On my quest to find answers I found Robert Lalondeâs book. To me this book was as exciting as a mystery even though I have stopped using sugar 10 years ago; I only eat junk food 2-3 times per year when it is the most practical solution, and I have stopped drinking soda so long ago that I forgot when that was. [and I believe that the chilled coffees with energy boosters are the next addictive craze.] Robert Lalonde talks about all these ""foods""...The clues get uncovered on the by and by when reading this book!Reading âEasy, Lean & Healthyâ I found the following paragraphââ¦When rats were fed a diet of junk food, they ignored their regular food and gained a lot of fat quickly. â¦ In experiments , the rats would endure cold temperatures and even electric shock to get at junk food, even when their regular food was sitting right thereâ¦.â(in a nutshell) This study is from 1976. We knew this all along!!!WOW â that is worse than what I suspected.I loved Robert Lalondeâs writing style.  I appreciate reading books from authors, who deliver well researched information in a way that I can remember easily.E.g. ââ¦. Butter is Rich in Fat-Soluble Vitamins.Butter contains several fat soluble vitamins including Vitamins A,E, and K2. Vitamin K2 is rare in the modern diet and it can have a powerful effect on your health. It is involved in calcium metabolism and a low intake has been associated with many serious diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and osteoporosisâ¦.âLalonde sums up: ââ¦ Dairy from grass-fed cows is particularly rich in Vitamin K2â¦.âThis reviewer (I) reflects, âArenât cardiovascular disease and cancer on top of the list of diseases that kill people, in the US.?âAnd, arenât already women my age getting asked to take bone density tests?At least I see a connection.Plus, I had always thought of margarine as some cheap stuff, that just could not be as good as butter, which was invented thousands of years ago  and is the real stuff.I am not going to give away more info because I really hope people will read this book. When Robert Lalonde writes, âThis book will change your lifeâ he is right. All of us need to worry about what we eat (Who cares what Ana and Christian feast on? Christian's got the money to cover expenses should open heart surgery become necessary.)Lastly, Robert Lalonde also offers real empowerment. In his book he teaches how to read labels, so we the consumers can take responsibility  for how we nourish our body (and brain). From now on I am going to go grocery shopping with my Kindle.Thank you, Robert Lalonde, for putting this important book together.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3I8BAVD18MN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6CR9LK#wasThisHelpful","R2F3I8BAVD18MN","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Itâs a wonderful novel about two people trying to experience paradise. Both, Sophia and Lucas, have had bad divorces, Sophia calls her ex âthe Snakeâ, I guess that says it all. Lucasâ ex is his ex because she got pregnant from another man.When the two of them meet on the yacht, which is supposed to bring them to the vacation island in the Maldives, Sophia is instantly attracted. Lucas, who really booked this trip for his (ex)wife and himself, merely tries to consume 50% of the trip he could not cancel; plus he wants to be âout of townâ when his ex gives birth. But all plans change in an instant. Pirates capture the expensive vessel. Sophia and Lucas are no luxury tourists any longer but unwanted witnesses. They escape and more difficulties are coming their way.Marci McRae tells the story from Sophiaâs point of view. Sophiaâs inner monologue is in part hysterical. I loved all her little thoughts and references to movies and books, Sophia has seen and read.ââ¦ Best of all there was the now classic âCastawayâ where only Tom Hanks could make you cry over the loss of a volleyball. And I cried, I wept loudly, trying to hide it as I sat in the theater and Wilson drifted awayâ¦ I loved that ball. All of America loved Wilson.âIndeed, Sophia and Lucas make it to an island too but things donât go that smooth. Even though they fall in love, one them gets sick and the other must save the day. But the adventure does not stop there. Finally rescued one of them disappears. Will they get a chance to experience real paradise?Awesome chick-lit  â inner monologues about shoes and packing, wraps, and how to prepare, in the end it will matter.

"This book is a bit of an unusual choice for me because I donât cook. However, I am trying to educate myself about healthy eating. I have come to suspect that a lot of the healthy problems we experience today stem from the foods we consume. The author Sebrina Conroy makes her case that these Detox soups energize, remove excess waste, help to build strong immunity, clean skin and improved breath, and that detoxification helps with weight loss and against premature aging.I have not cooked all recipes from this book but only two, the Lentil, Kale and Sweet Potato Stew and the Kale and Lentil Soup.As you might suspect, I LOVE lentils; I credit my frequent consumption of lentils for my hairsâ thickness (at my age) and shine. Therefore I also made the stew with fresh lentils instead of lentils from a can (Loved the hint of curry in this stew). And, I seasoned the Kale and Lentil Soup with a hint of lemon juice instead of zest.These are very simple recipes, even suitable for people like me, who donât really cook a lot. Nothing stands in the way of detoxing every now and then. 5 starsGisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MXPGDB3RSP3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ROCNJXW#wasThisHelpful","R2MXPGDB3RSP3C","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short book is the prequel to the Cattarina Mystery series. Cattarina is a cat named for Edgar Allen Poeâs cat Cattarina. Of course, the story is fictitious and told through Cattarinaâs eyes.I loved the writing, it seemed so fitting, I loved the little details, which pointed to that the author, Monica Shaughnessy, is not only well read but also a true cat lover.ââ¦ âYou may call me Auntie Sass when you are able,â she (Aunt Sass, the  cat) said. âAnd I will call you nothing until you have earned your name. That is the way of the cat.ââ¦âShaughnessy strikes a perfect tone to make thing mysterious and charming at the same time.ââ¦ One bitter winter day, when the clouds had turned to ash and the mice had buried themselves in the burrows, HeDevil (nickname for Mr. Osgood) opened the backdoor and sent us scattering. He did not call for us.Instead, he looked vaguely in our direction with eyes as leaden as the weather. Auntie Sass stepped forward but seemed unwilling to shorten the gap more than a few strides.I tired of her lead. âWe must go to him,â I urged.âI donât trust him, QuickPaw, he has done something to the SheDevil,â she saidâ¦âThis short story tells how the lonely kitten, the only one to survive from her family , got rescued and came to survive. She will embark on great adventures.If I have one complaint it is that the book is too short. I am not convinced that the quite common system of publishing sequels with samples from future books (as this one does) is really good for books. But, be this as it may, I highly recommend âTo the River: Rescue by the Schuylkillâ â It is a treat for everybody, who loves cats, adventure, and a good old fashioned mystery.4 stars only because I thought the book is too short, if I could split scores I'd give the writing 6 stars.Gisela Hausmann, author  & blogger","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IVHCZ16OGMH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKH7RR0#wasThisHelpful","R3IVHCZ16OGMH4","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*When Darkness Breaks* by Traci Sanders deals with two topics everybody is familiar with, *overcoming tragedy* and *overcoming unexpected success*Â.The young couple, Amber and Drake, has a picture perfect life. Love, two wonderful children, an adorable house! But, of course, both of them are reaching for higher goals. In AmberÃ¢â¬â¢s case, her mom seems to be a part of it. Ã¢â¬ÅHer Amber would have the hottest careerÃ¢â¬Â¦ Ã¢â¬Â, but two pregnancies seem to divert AmberÃ¢â¬â¢s career path. Mom is not too pleased. When finally all career steps fall together, it is too much for both, Amber and Drake.Both of them are offered a fantastic position at the same time, but as bad-luck has it at the opposite ends of the country. A heated, emotional debate follows in the car and Drake has an accident and kills a young boy, though he is not found at fault. Emotionally scarred the family leaves for New York so Drake can accept his position and Amber becomes a stay at home mom. Drake is unable to cope with the pressure of guilt and the job; slowly but surely his life falls apart. I am not into spoilers, so readers will have to find out for themselves how Amber and Drake maneuver their way of this situation.ItÃ¢â¬â¢s the little details that make this story enchanting and bring it home.Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬Â¦ She stopped when she noticed her childrenÃ¢â¬â¢s handprints embedded into the paver stones.

"Personally I always find it sad, when books like this one arenât being updated.Seriouslyâ¦ Is there anybody, who does not know how FB or twitter works? My cat has a twitter account, which may not be that extraordinary, whatâs more extraordinary is that she follows cats, which have 12,000+ followers.

"""Culture Shock - A Practical Guide"" by H.E. Rybol is a very neat book. It addresses the topics, which typically are not covered in travel guides.Yes, while traveling we can feel easily annoyed, excited, feel like your personal space is being intruded upon, out of place, free, full of anticipation, fully alive, guilty, happily overwhelmed, and so much more. In order to make the most out of our trip (after all most of us do not have as much vacation time as weâd like to) we need to learn to cope with that.Once travelers master these issues they too can sayââ¦ It is a raw but exhilarating experience. One of the wonderful things about culture shock is that it brings us back to basics. It is a reminder of whatâs essentialâ¦âSince this reviewer has traveled almost 100,000 kilometers I can honestly state that H.E. Rybol gives great advice. The only thing I would have added to the listed items, that will help us find comfort:, I made it a habit to always pack cereal bars in my luggage. At least I cannot stomach hot seasoned food in the morning for breakfast.  (Please note that food items have to be in the your checked bag(s)).  H.E. Rybol also gives clever advice how to find comfort for security issues (Using the same streets. Go to the same placesâ¦.)In particular I appreciated that this author suggestedââ¦ 3. Go to the movies! Thatâs one thing I try to do everywhere I travel to - go to the movie theater! The experiences are so different! From the Cuban movie in La Havana to the Bollywood film in Pune, Indiaâ¦âI went to the movies in China and in India and can vouch for that absolutely nothing compares to watching a movie with 3,000 people, not even visiting Grauman's Chinese Theatre (Hollywood Boulevard).

"ItÃ¢â¬â¢s an interesting book because I was wondering to whom I should recommend it? Women who are thinking about getting married (to re-examine their guy), women, who are happily married so they can see what they are missing (thank-God), or husbands, who feel they should do something to improve their marriage.Throughout the book we are following Heather, Catherine, and Victoria, and their families. I suffered the most with Heather, because her mother-in-law could star in a movie without a script. I felt, that when insecure Heather married Lance she did not realize that this woman would make her the reason for everything that is and could possibly be wrong his her sonÃ¢â¬â¢s/HeatherÃ¢â¬â¢s husbandÃ¢â¬â¢s life. To be honest I could not understand why she did not think about cheating any earlier.I did not really connect with Catherine, but thatÃ¢â¬â¢s a personal problem. I was never a Ã¢â¬Ëperfect momÃ¢â¬â¢ like she is, nor did I attempt. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s probably why the story of her affair is really interesting (sorry, no spoilers)Probably of all stories, VictoriaÃ¢â¬â¢s story is the most common; she and her husband  have been married so long, that they have drifted apart.What makes this book exceptional is that the author writes fabulous dialogues.Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬ÅSorry I lost my job. Throw it in my face why donÃ¢â¬â¢t you? DonÃ¢â¬â¢t you even care about me?Ã¢â¬Â He threw his head into his hands.[We feel for Ed and wonder about Victoria.]VictoriaÃ¢â¬â¢s heart oozed. The sorrow in his eyes sparked memories of her father. Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢m sorry, IÃ¢â¬â¢m being inconsiderate. Let me start dinner and then we can talk while we eat.Ã¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬ÅI donÃ¢â¬â¢t want to talk to you, I just want food.Ã¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â[Now we realize what the problem is. Plus, we feel that this kind of reaction must have happened too often already.]It is these excellent dialogues that made this book better and different than similar books I have read. The author demonstrates her talent to tie us, the readers, to the story. We want to know how the three friends can move on.Summing up, IÃ¢â¬â¢d recommend this book to all three groups as mentioned at the beginning of my review; probably most of all Ã¢â¬â to husbands.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TM6X80Y9WDML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K87TGG4#wasThisHelpful","R2TM6X80Y9WDML","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the title says âParanormal Loveâ is about paranormal people, events, and places. It is a genre I typically do not read; however, somewhat intrigued I read this collection of stories because they are about LOVE. To me, love stories are better than gruesome stories. That being said, danger lurks in this book but most often characters are fascinated or drawn into events.I found the book to be an interesting sampler of how the various types of paranormal characters behave and what they do. My favorite stories were, listed not in order of preference but in order of how they come up in the book,âWitch Hunterâ by Marie Godley, which packaged the wish to help others and overcome preset mindsets with a very sweet love story,âThe Land of Deathâ by Jennifer Loiske; in particular I appreciated that she chose a young lawyer to be her heroine. Since lawyers are supposed to be very logical and level headed, Loiskeâs plot of her young lawyerâs encounter with a black smoky creature unfolds even more interesting,âThe Mirrorâ by Drue Fairlie, which felt like watching a French Film Noir movies from the 50âs, plus, I really like decorating and home improvement,âHealing Love by Marie Godleyâ, which I liked because of the many interesting references to healing herbs.âObsessedâ by Jennifer Loiske, which really had me on the edge because opposite to the other stories and I could not even guess where the plot was going.That being said, the other stories are quite interesting too, I am merely pointing out which stories I personally enjoyed the most.The only thing I missed in this book was a ToC at the beginning which would enable the reader to go to his/her favorite story. This is an excellent book for readers new to this genre because I am happy to say the stories have happy endings. If I give this book 4**** it is only because I am not familiar with the genre and donât know what the top standards are.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT3DMH8DVN5Q0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWHIXWA#wasThisHelpful","RT3DMH8DVN5Q0","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very neat book, I was smitten with it. The author, Clayton Geoffreys makes his case by listing 7 Reasons Why Being Witty Can Elevate Conversation Skills. Wit is Appreciated and Provokes Laughter, Shared Wit Solidifies Relationships, Wit Promotes Open-Mindedness, Wit Promotes Critical Thinking, Wit Fuels Creativity, and Wit Tempers Hostility.You get the gist of his argument? Wit is something for smart people, who look even smarter when they share their wittiness. But there is more,ââ¦ As stated earlier, laughter promotes myriad health benefits, and it has the added advantage of endearing persons to the source of all this laughter, the witty person(s) themselves. Consequently, witty people are sought after because the benefits of being in their company are immense.âThe author lists two case studies, âGroucho Marxâ and âRobin Williamsâ, and while I would not necessarily call his writings case studies, I believe that he provides two very neat short biographies, which describe how the named comedians got to make their mark in history.Since truly funny people have to keep a lot in mind, e.g. for which audience to make which joke so it will be welcome Clayton Geoffreys explains how to train to become this witty person. In particular I appreciated that Clayton states that people should read the dictionary. That includes the slang dictionary, like he so vividly illustrates with the well chosen example of a TV reporter, who suggested that people would even beaver, if they could. That goes to show that this book is even a witty.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SBRF4TN8LKLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1507618166#wasThisHelpful","R2SBRF4TN8LKLB","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Delightful, interesting and funny. Rarely have I enjoyed reading a time traveler story as much as this one.Angela, a nurse from Arizona is vacationing with her boyfriend in England. Returning to the hotel early, she finds him in bed with another woman. Furious, she drives off, has a car accident and is transferred into 1648. In Cornwall of 1648, Nicholas Warren, a rich estate owner, finds her and brings her to his home. At his estate lives also Ellen, a nurse/doctor by Medieval standards. Considering the time period, Angela, with her blue hair tips and fancy tattoo, could be taken for a witch. Luckily, both, Nicholas and Ellen, are open-minded people, who want to learn from Angela. Ellen manages to save the badly hurt Angela. And, yes, Nicholas is attracted to her at first sight but he has more than one secret, which make him a complicated character. Will Ellen and Nicholas find together?What makes this novel outstanding is that besides demonstrating a solid knowledge of history, author Diana Douglas made it a fun book to read.When Nicholas complains that Angela is such a (modern) strong willed woman, who does not behave herself according to the standards of 17th century England, Angela comes right back, ââ¦ I apologize for any inconvenience I may have caused you,â she said. âNext time I decide to take a jaunt through the centuries, Iâll skip Haverscroft Manor and drop in on Attila the Hun or Ghengis Khan. I will be probably more welcomeâ¦.âThis author also makes it fun to read about historic customs,ââ¦ Comfortable? In addition to being in pain, she was cold, caffeine deprived and slightly nauseous from the warm cider and salted fish she had been served for breakfastâ¦.âAnd, when Nicholas sees Angelaâs cellphone,âMother of God!â he exclaimed. âI am not a man of religion, but that thing is possessed.âI thoroughly appreciated the cleverness, with which this author set up her plot. Angela is a visitor from the US, thus it makes sense that she carries many tourist brochures in her bag. When Nicholas Warren finds her, he also finds the brochures. And, opposite to many he is not illiterate! Nicholas is a supporter of King Charles I. From the brochures he learns that Oliver Cromwell will sign King Charles I's death warrant. What will he do with this knowledge? Add in that Nicholas is also a kind of time traveler and you see why this plot is a lot more interesting than many others.I was tickled with the many clever side plots, this author devised. For instance, after saving a man with the Heimlich maneuver at a country fair people think that Angela is a witch (remember, she is a nurse), which in those days is worse, than if she had not saved the man. Then, there is also Nick Warrenâs son, who opposite to his father is the personification of evil.The author even finds a way to explain why Angela will not travel back to her time. Nicholas gets to question if she would have survived the bad accident in her time. Maybe, if she had an opportunity to go back, sheâd be a corpse in a ditch along highway A30? As turns it out, Angela will travel other times too. Diana Douglas found a great way to end her book, (no, I am not in the habit of spoiling).  Iâll be reading the next one too.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MINWHDGIM7WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5FNVD0#wasThisHelpful","R3MINWHDGIM7WA","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Itâs an excellent book! I read it even though my two cats do not have any problems. Basically the reason, why I read this book was to find input about things I did not know.I had always thought that I was lucky with my two cats, ever since I managed to get them used to each other they donât create any problem. Author Jade King makes a case for âthe more you love your cat(s) they more theyâll love you backâ â and I do that. So, maybe thatâs why they are so happy.Most interesting to me was the chapter âTrain you r cat to become a good eaterâ. My cats help themselves whenever they are hungry, they eat together and so far I thought thatâs fine. Now after reading this book I am contemplating whether I should train them to become good eaters.Thank you,Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86KRESGDZNCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UG2NREI#wasThisHelpful","R86KRESGDZNCG","A2SPF129OKGORN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SPF129OKGORN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this bag because I own a Gear S watch.  This phone sent so much of my daily work travel texts data to the watch comparing yesterday's trip to today's that it was driving me crazy deleting all of that minute by minute data from the Gear S.  The only bummer now is that I can't use the watch to call via the phone while its in the bag.  Oh well, I'd rather not have any of my traveling monitored anyways.  That's nobody's business to begin with and everyone's phone is giving out that information and some company is storing that data somewhere.  Granted if anyone is tracking you they can get location once the phone is outside the bag again but if only used while traveling nobody can track your real time movements and exact location of the drive you took turn by turn.  Another plus is if you don't want to be bothered by anyone (or are trying to stop a bad habit) just stash your phone in the bag as no signal will get through.  I have a Note 4 that fits well in this bag.  I'm happy with it for both reasons I've listed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29GSXZ2RBRATV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJMCI7G#wasThisHelpful","R29GSXZ2RBRATV","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The easiest food sealer I've ever used.  Very intuitive and easy two figure out.  This unit has the easiest vacuum system I've used yet too.  That was my clincher.  I was able to get mine at $50.00 bucks (the same price as my starter that was kind of a pain to get right) so watch for a price dip (hopefully) or check around, although very unlikely to go for the price I got it for but well worth the price set because of the ease of use.  My local membership store had it at $70.00 with $20.00 off at the register.  I lucked out and happened to shop there the right day.This is so simple to use you shouldn't even need instructions.  It also comes with bags and the attachments for sealing side seal bags and bottles.  Even at this price here this is a great and VERY easy to use sealer.  I do use pre-cut bags so I haven't started using the bags that came with the unit.  I've also not had a chance to try the hose and bottling unit as we probably won't use that.  The vacuum is very quick and can be stopped and the heater started at any time.  The colored lights let you know what's going on.  The locking latch is a nice touch too.  It helps insure the proper pressure for the vacuum and then seal.  The removable liquid catch tray is also a very useful and easy to clean device.  So far every seal is a one shot deal.  No re dos like with the old one.  This hasn't blown a vacuum or seal yet and I've been going crazy with this because it does such a better job than my old one.  Man I was in the stone age!This unit is not really small nor is it extremely large but (is big) probably larger than you want sitting out all the time.  It does have a nice sleek appearance if you do plan on leaving it on the counter.  If you choose to store it (or place it on the counter) you'll probably need a little bit of space because the sealer is 17"" long (plus plug space) by 9"" wide by 4"" at the highest point.  Odds are you'll put it away since it would waste quite a fair bit of counter space....that is unless you're one who has a humungous kitchen.  If that's the case you can afford a better FoodSaver!If you want easy then this is the unit for you.  I'm very glad I upgraded. I used to use the Ziploc but man this is sooo easy its amazing.  The Ziploc model, which was excellent to start with, is nothing to start with.  I only used the sealer occasionally previously but now since I've got the Anova 2 Souse Vide heater I've been using the sealer very frequently.  This does not wast any time and does not frustrate!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NVNS3ZYIDI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUGK5QW#wasThisHelpful","R23NVNS3ZYIDI1","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was posted on the AT&T black branded Gear S on 12/13 (worn since 11/20), hence the update after this first post here.12/18/14 updated below - please read that too. You will find it interesting. Your view of my rating could be higher or lower depending on how you take my update. Possibly a little creepy especially since this has a mic. Now 4 stars down from 5 due to possible big brother implications. Call me cautious? Call me paranoid?I was given this as a gift and was, at first blush, embarrassed and surprised at the amount it cost my friend (he got it without plan but specific to my carrier) and thought it a bit showy for me. Boy have I come to change that opinion. This watch almost replaces the phone for me now. I now pretty much use my phone as a hotspot at work for my laptop and then make calls and send texts from the watch. When I have time to kill I can either read the news on the watch or even try and browse using the Opera browser for the Gear S. This watch has so many useful apps like calculator, calendar, compass, voice recorder, fitness tracking, pulse, photo album, CNN news, and tons of other apps. They've even got apps to help you find your car. When bored I end up reading the news. You can even use the watch to play the mp3s on your phone or stream music directly from the watch. The real beauty of this is being able to make a call while driving by just talking to your watch and since its blue-tooth its legal. It connects to the newer Samsung phones by blue-tooth, wi-fi, and S beam. You can use it either as is or you can get its own (additional) sim card and then make the watch a dedicated phone that can also access and operate though your smartphone.You operate the watch and get to different screens and options by either swiping up, down, left, or right, and with touch, or by voice. You will be surprised at the options this watch has. I've never had an electronic watch before so I've got nothing to compare with, but speaking as someone who would have NEVER considered getting one of these watches now consider it indispensable. The vibrating alarm is another one of the killer features and you can set multiple alarms and it is very easy to set repeating alarms. You know ... to remind you of whatever you need being reminded about, maybe like the end of the workday, time to take medicine, pick up the kid, etc.The screen is big, crisp, colorful, and at first, I thought that it was too big for me but the screen size is just right and the resolution is awesome. It tethers well to my Note 4 and don't have a sim card for the watch so only use it to answer calls and make calls though the cellphone. What's even greater is this watch is voice activated. Hopefully the next version will be android instead of Tizen so it can work even more apps but in the meantime I find this one heck of a useful watch that I never thought I'd like, but now love. Even though I have a very thin wrist the length of the watch is perfect for it and the watch strap is very easily adjusted to accommodate very thin wrists. You can even easily change the watchbands, if you need, by popping the watch out of the band.If you decide to use the skin for this watch (the skin is beautiful, easy to apply, and invisible after application) it will decrease the sensitivity of the touch screen. I've tried it with the film but am annoyed at the loss of sensitivity so, currently, I'm using the watch without the protector. I got accidental damage insurance on this so I guess I'll chance going without the protector due to the lack of responsiveness with the (invisible) skin on.12/18/14 I just became aware, today due to my negligence, that this SMART watch has figured out, on its own, where I live (via GPS), when I leave for work, the route I take and gives the road warnings and comparison timing by text to work, it knows the time I start work, where I work, when I leave work, my days off, and the route I take home. It even tells me when I get home later than normal. The watch also tells you if your ride to/from work was longer or shorter than the day before. It is tracking you everywhere. It must be using the GPS in the phone, time of day, regularity, steps taken, and possibly other movement types to the watch along with data from the phone. I now find it a little scary that this can track and figure out what you're doing and where. I hadn't been paying attention to those messages that were coming off the watch until I cleared them all. I guess we've got to wonder just how much tracking is going on without our knowledge and just how much this thing can really do. Scary and now has me thinking and wondering if the security implications are worth it, but it is still a dang awesome smart watch! Much more impressive now that I know this watch figures out what you do the more you use it. If you are paranoid of the man then this watch is certainly not on your agenda. Its basically a 24/7 tracker, something that some nosy folks may find quite interesting since this can follow where you are to the exact location every second you wear this watch. Perhaps a tad too smart? Very Orwellian.Don't forget to clear your notices on the watch or it will take forever to clear all the different types of notices when you finally realize you've been letting them pile up. Delete after you view. Don't remember a month later. It took me forever to clear everything that built up for 28 days, not to mention the space the files took up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C2ESRP3569HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PUK5SX4#wasThisHelpful","R2C2ESRP3569HW","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like, not love this case....actually maybe I do.  After all, I ordered another after breaking the first that didn't fit.  The first one never did fit right and didn't catch the corners well.  I put up with it for a while until I broke it at the clip accidentally.  I wish I had gotten the case I got this time instead of the one the last time because I was too lazy to grumble the first order.  This one fits like a glove but I give 4 stars because of the cruddy first case I got that never fit right.To be fair, now that I've got one that fits correctly I'm impressed.  This case is armored well and is well suited to protect a Note from a very serious drop.Remember to check your fit right away and make sure that all 4 sides cover the front of the phone.  The silicone or rubber doesn't always want to comply and grip your phone properly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB98GNUC5HQC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGU9I3K#wasThisHelpful","RB98GNUC5HQC7","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***12/14/14 Rating updated to 3 stars even though this was the easiest and nicest screen protector I've ever applied to a device.  I really do love the clarity and ease this film applies.  The problem lay with the lack of sensitivity to the gorilla glass on the watch.  Even though the screen film is visually perfect for what it is made for its still difficult for me to use the touchscreen easily but if you are a klutz you better get this!  You can press harder.  It's just that the Gear S is already particular when swiping the screen so the film just makes it a bit harder.  It is the perfect screen protector otherwise.Easy to install if you read and follow the instructions.  If you can't then you've still got five more tries or if you installed right the first time you've got five replacements.  There is a nice feel to the touch of this screen protector and works fairly well to the touch.  With six screen protectors you can't go wrong especially when the first went on as smoothly as silk.  Installation, following instructions, made a one time placement go perfectly, smoothly, and easily.  Now I've got 5 spares.  Looks great and responds fairly well although you do need to apply more pressure when touching the screen.  You can't go wrong with this small screen insurance for protection against scratches or gashes but, again, it does require a harder touch to get the watch to respond. Occasionally, the lack of response due to the skin can be frustrating but it is worth it for the protection. This thing is really invisible when put on correctly and great screen insurance.***12/14/14 I pulled the skin off as I've been getting frustrated due to the lack of sensitivity to touch the watch has developed with the skin on.  I now have to swipe pretty hard against the glass to get a response and find myself swiping up to 6 times to turn off an alarm or answer the watch.  This is still the easiest and cleanest to apply and is virtually invisible when on the watch.  It just makes the watch a bit numb.If you can afford it buy accidental insurance instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R7XN5WTV2BW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG0LH26#wasThisHelpful","R1R7XN5WTV2BW6","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As advertised I was extremely disappointed with the bass.  It was very light.  Design wise this is a beauty but the motion controls are a pain and pairing them for left and right was just not possible.  I was also getting problems right away with the on off button that rises about a half an inch to open and turn on.

"This has served me well for adding multiple USB3 peripherals with a Surface Pro 2.  I had no problems running an external blu ray recorder which required an additional USB port for power along with 2 USB3 1 TB external hard drives and one USB3 key simultaneously.  I realize that even though this is USB3 that only so much data can pass through that one cable and back so I have no complaints about speed of data transfer.  Blu ray playback through the tablet to a 60"" flat screen played flawlessly while I worked on a file on the computer off of one of the external drives.  This powered port has turned out to be a blessing for me when I want to load up my Surface Pro 2 with a ton of peripherals that need the power.My only annoyance with this and the reason I gave only 4 stars is the way the USB plug out is set upside down of the position I need the plug placed.  I am forced to place the unit upside down and everything plugged in upside down so it can sit next to the tablet in order to use it easily.  The power adapter should be smaller too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSH5SMRZ7N32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4V02BQ#wasThisHelpful","RCSH5SMRZ7N32","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my 4.25 lb dog for when I finally take her to go up to play in the snow.  This is a perfect fit for her so unless you have a thin dog (her chest circumference is 13.5"" at the crest of her chest) you may want to opt for a larger size.  I usually have to order X small for her.  This coat seals well and holds the warmth in very well partly because it fits very snugly.  It is made with nice sturdy material and comes with a detachable hood which is a very nice touch.  I am confident this will work well for my tiny dog to play in the snow.  (Yes we got shoes!)

"This is the answer if you use up to 5 different type devices.  I am currently this on 2 Windows 7 64 bit laptops, 1 Surface Pro 2 running Win 8.1, a Samsung Galaxy Note II tablet, and Samsung Galaxy 4 phone and am protected on all fronts with, what I believe to be, the best antiviral program around.  They don't care what year key they validate because downloaded and ran 21013 with a 2012 s/n and done that stuff before.You can install Kaspersky Internet Security on the computers AND you can always keep the software current because Kaspersky allows you to install the latest program as long as your key is valid.  I just updated them all from 2013 to 2014 without a hitch.  That's another PLUS for this company!  There is a program for Android tablets that scans real time, watches your apps, runs in the background, and updates by itself.  The phone and tablet AV & security program has a special program that can be used to track your phone if it is stolen.  You can also use it as a location finder, and/or to photograph the thief, and wipe all data from your phone if you need to remotely.  What more can you ask for buying one program to protect multiple devices across different platforms?I highly advise that you watch for lightning deals on this (or any Kaspersky program you may use) as I stock up on them then because the keys remain valid for years and when I'm ready to use one I've bought on lightning deal I go to Kaspersky for the latest software download and then use the unused key.

"I purchased this after reading the reviews here on Amazon for several different models from different manufacturers after returning a $190.00 fancy version I picked up at Costco.  I returned it unopened after thinking that I had spent too much.  Still needing (more wanting) one I came back here, read the reviews, and bought this model.  I also purchased 11"" X 16"" and 8"" X 12"" pre-cut pouches since they are cheaper (to me) than by roll.  Try measuring per foot vs. pre-cut by length and compare prices and you will probably come to the same conclusion.The first few attempts using the vacuum sealer were hit and miss so I figured the machine was not so great.  It would sometimes vacuum excellently and then at some times the vacuum half arsed.  The seal has always been perfect.  It turns out that the problem was me.  I realized I needed to make sure the vacuum nozzle was inside the lips of the bag before doing the seal.  Apparently on my misses the nozzle ended up slipping out from between the lips of the bag.  I am amazed at the vacuum that this model generates when it is used properly.  I have not tried the bottle vacuum attachment since we have no need for that.  A very good vacuum is created and the sealer works properly.  I have had no problems with this other than user error and am very happy with this purchase.  I'm also glad I got the large and medium sized bags in lots of 100.  I found that I got more pre-sealed bags for my buck than I could by any roll.  I am also able to make smaller pouches by subdividing the individual pouches.Back to the rating...for the price and after knowing how well this operates I do not hesitate to recommend this unit.  Why pay 2 to 4 times more for something that does the same, or maybe even worse than this inexpensive but fully capable vacuum sealer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LXKU1XPA6N4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIACGWM#wasThisHelpful","R2LXKU1XPA6N4S","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review updated 2/4/2014When I purchased this umbrella it appeared obvious that this pup is crafted very well and is nice and strong.  Since getting this umbrella I've used it several times in very heavy rains and it kept me dry from head to toe because the umbrella is large.  It also stands up very well to strong winds.  I was afraid this would turn inside out with heavy winds but the strong metal inner structure kept this umbrella firm and steady.  It is well worth the money even though you (I) can no longer use the case once you (I) take the umbrella out.  I now know that this umbrella is sturdy enough to withstand turning inside out in pretty strong storm winds which shows me just how sturdy this umbrella is. Just figure you're going to ditch or store the holder (umbrella case) once you try putting it back on after you've taken it off and you've opened up the umbrella.  You can try for yourself but I figured I'd save you time and frustration.  I'm glad I shelled out the bucks and got this even though the case is useless.  The umbrella rocks because it is very sturdy and is made of great materials.  For the size of this umbrella it is well worth the cost.  You're not paying for the name as much as the quality, which is excellent with the exception of the small pouch holder.Keep in mind this is a 62"" umbrella so it will NOT fold as small as a standard size collapsible umbrellas.  It is about 6 or 8 inches longer when closed than regular collapsible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWYQ8P05VEW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZM3FLA#wasThisHelpful","RQWYQ8P05VEW3","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I also use this with a Sonicare toothbrush and I'm sure that has a part in it but I was also using the Sonicare before I started using this (brand/style-used different flavors) toothpaste.This is expensive compared to tube type toothpaste and I figure that the can is necessary for the delivery of the foaming gel which is probably why this costs more but I do like this toothpaste and am willing to spend a little more on it so I spend a lot less at the dentist. This foaming gel is different.  It foams up when you brush your teeth but if you leave a blob sitting on the counter from the tube you will see it will have expanded a few hours later.  The bubbles don't expand quickly when the toothpaste is not in motion.  It also seems to last as long as a tube of toothpaste would.  You can use less of this toothpaste as it increases in volume when you brush.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZPBWMF65X12F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EHHMNM#wasThisHelpful","RZPBWMF65X12F","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4/10/13 Update.  My dog no longer eats these.  She simply refuses these now and prefers to go without a treat if not given a greenie or Milo beef jerky treats instead. (Shortly after this review I stopped giving Milo.)I didn't do due diligence when buying this product.  I didn't read the ad copy or the reviews and assumed it was like chunks of processed chicken jerky treat.  That was my mistake. This item is like ground chicken formed into squarish, pillow shaped, patties with who knows what else.  These aren't solid either.  You can squeeze them flat as they are filled with air.  At any rate, my chi-pom, who loves her Greenies, chew sticks, jerky and other treats, would not eat these initially.  She flat out refused them and ignored them even when left out for her.  I have never seen my dog refuse to eat a dog treat before these.  I didn't give her any treats for a few days and she started eating these but these seem to be her treat of last resort.3/2/14 I still give only greenies and some rawhide chews but I now make her homemade cookies!

"12/14/14 re-rated to 1 stars for Cargill lying to us all about this being natural.  Cargill lost the right to call this product natural, settled claims, and must now list it as NON natural because of the highly processed nature of the product, and may contain or is derived from GMOs.  Why, in light of this, are they still calling it natural?A possibly good product although each packet is much larger in size to other non sugar sweeteners.  (Think a sugar packet stuffed to the max.)  Stevia is a natural leaf product that sweetens that many countries have used for decades safely.  So why did Coke and Cargill block Stevia from use in the US, through Congress, for over 20 years until they could figure out to use it to make money for Coke and Cargill?  After all, they did know that Stevia was a natural sweetener used around the world before getting their paid henchmen (Congress and the FDA) to stop the sale of Stevia until they could figure how to make bucks off of it.  (How they could stop people using a natural product until they could refine and make tons of money off of it is beyond me as Japan was using it for decades safely.)  I assume a lot of Congressmen and folks in other Government Departments got some good money from these companies for 2 decades. Cargill refuses to disclose what the manufacture process is and what extra ingredients are in it that make the packet so large and what extra binders and additives are in it besides the chemically treated Stevia, which WAS naturally green, to turn into a white powder.  What chemicals did they use to BLEACH it from green to white and what else have they added to it?  I don't know what's in this and neither do a lot of folks but if you want to try Truvia this is a very fair deal.  They claim it to be sweeter than Splenda but it does not seem sweeter to me.I can't guarantee or speak about long term safety because this hasn't been out long enough but I find that it takes more packets of Truvia to sweeten (actually lessen the bitterness of) my coffee than Splenda does. This just seems (to me) to cut the bitterness rather than add a sweet taste and to be honest I do add Splenda to sweeten it more, which kind of defeats the purpose of, what now is, this exercise in futility.  When you see the packet you'll understand what I mean about the size especially when  you tear it open.  Possibly a better alternative to Splenda or at least seemingly slightly more natural than chlorinated sugar (Splenda).You would probably be better off just buying pure Stevia.  I also see some companies offering Stevia/sugar mix packets.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ECOAH1UXEUBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PMSTTE#wasThisHelpful","R3ECOAH1UXEUBV","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wondered what kind of nut would buy this expensive cream and figured I'd really end up panning this cream if I tried it, but curiosity got to me, so I said WTF and ordered it to gave it a go and see if it was what it is cracked up to be.  Man was I wrong in assuming this was a rip off deal.  When i ordered this I also wondered what I'd do as I have mild psoriasis on my face that causes redness and flaky skin that I use a preventive ointment on.  I decided to stop using the cream for the psoriasis a week before this came.  Once this cream arrived I started using this [sparingly] as the price alone should be a shout out that this is not Jergens.  I apply about a ball shaped dime sized dose in total all over my face, once in the morning and once in the evening, when applied I notice a very slight tingling around my eyelids and the bags under my eyes like, for about an hour (nothing irritating - more like a cool tingle), so it seems that is doing something to the fatty or saggy areas there every time I apply the cream.  I don't feel anything anywhere else on my face like I do around my eyes.  The tingling seems to last about an hour.  After about 2.5 weeks of using this I checked pictures taken when I started using this and the bags under the eyes seem a tad less noticeable and the skin seems tighter.  This was verified visually from someone that saw me before I started using this cream twice daily and saw me again just before i wrote this review.I know this is moisturizing my skin because without the psoriasis cream my inner cheek areas flake lightly.  Since using this there has been absolutely no flaking so I know this is moisturizing but the best thing I like about this is that my face feels smooth and dry and not wet or moist like with a regular over the counter moisturizers.  It is very pleasant knowing it moisturizes without leaving you wet or moist from a lotion.  If I can swing it I am determined to buy at least one more after this tube runs out and if this works out well or not I'm updating this review in another 2 to 3 weeks to at least finish the tube for a full review of a complete tube.  It will all depend on how long the Vitality cream lasts.Anyone who is griping about the smell has to be using an awful lot and that is not the intent with this cream. (Obviously from the price.)  The aroma is a nice light manly scent that is barely noticeable when applied in the amount that is normally applied with a cream like this.  If you have the money and are willing to try this I don't think you will regret the purchase especially if you are used to purchasing products like this.The rating I'm giving is due to the fact that the delivery system for this VERY EXPENSIVE cream needs to be better made to dispense small droplets rather than the occasional large goop popping out because an air bubble, heavy finger, or accidental hard squeeze.  This is way too expensive for a crappy delivery system.  A pump would be better.  Too much can be wasted by an accidental squeeze or bubble in the tube.  So far I'm giving this a 4 star rating even with the expensive price but mainly because people need to be able to dispense this easier and with a set drop size.  I am impressed with this cream's effect on me to date.  Further updates on effect on skin are to come as I use up the tube.  I'LL BE BACK!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MZ2WCMAWZV6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094C5C3A#wasThisHelpful","R1MZ2WCMAWZV6M","A13PD0PF0KAAUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13PD0PF0KAAUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you ever get this on a Lightning deal or deal of the day go for it.  I got mine here for less than $135.00 on one of those...can't remember which.  This was one of the best purchases I've made.  This drill has come is very handy for us especially since we ended up screwing a wood fence together.  Having 2 LI batteries is a plus but even one battery last quite some time.  The torque on this drill is unreal and have cooked useless a few drill bits abusing this drill going through solid concrete.  Everything fits fine in the case and having the hard case is nice too.  If you can get this on the cheap do not miss the deal.  This is an extraordinary, powerful, cordless, hammer drill, screwdriver functions, and TWO LI batteries.  You will not run out of power part way through a project. The batteries also hold their charge for a long time just sitting in the case after a charge.

"These look very stylish compared to the old style doggles which my dog wore previously.  Unfortunately, because of the style change these no longer rest against the dog's face and must sit on the bridge of the nose and have to be balanced, and strapped in place.  I have never gotten these to sit properly on my dog so she never really got to use them for more than a few minutes.  They've pretty much been sitting around useless since I acquired them as they've never stayed in place on my dog long enough for even a photograph.  The old style doggles, although primitive looking, fit much better than this new style.  Those old style goggles could at least rest against my dog's face and stay in place.  This newer style is useless for my Chi/Pom mix.  This new style was a waste of money.

"It took me a long time to upgrade from an ancient plug and tug trimmer to the Black and Decker LHT2220. I tend to be stubborn and tight with my cash, so I made do. Then I cut through yet another outdoor power cord and, after making a set of ""green lightning"" (with respect to the ""white lightning"" version) of speaker cables from the remnants, started looking for a cordless trimmer. I tried several for heft and feel, and I liked the lack and Decker LHT2220.It really does make fast work of most shrubs and small tree limbs, as they fall away quickly. The length of this trimmer makes it easier to reach deeper into large shrubs or keep from contorting and bending more than needed. In my weekend warrior hubris, I figured I would outlast the battery, but to my surprise, I was finished with the semiannual trim in much less time than I expected, and the battery showed no signs of fading. A bit of clean up and wiping, and I was done.The instructions are easy to follow, and the trimmer is easy to use. It's a time saver and if it proves durable, I see no reason not to recommend this trimmer for a homeowner.

"I've been trying this Omron Electrotherapy Max Power Relief portable TENS unit for about a month now. I really hope for a bit more, as Omron states that this portable unit has 2X the power.It may. Punch in the higher settings on one of the nine different modes, and you will feel some power emanating from the sticky pads attached to ones's shoulders, back, or knee. It can actually become quite unpleasant. I have had my shoulder jerking violently to the point I was thinking this must be what a victim of of Sydenhams chorea must have felt like during the throes of what was called Saint Vitus Dance. I could feel some fatigue in the muscles, but no decrease in tension or pain.I had a bit of luck trying this portable unit on a sore knee, where it did seem to make something of a difference. After a few sessions, that knee no longer hurt----for a few hours.The unit is portable, no doubt about that. It has some punch, and it is easy to use. The pads attach to and peel from skin easily and do seem to be pretty durable. My bigger fear is that the absurdly skinny wires will bend, fray, and break well before I need to change the pads. It seems like increasing the diameter of the flimsy wires would be a no-brainer for the manufacturer not only for durability but also for their ability to deliver the current with a bit more efficiency.The pouch for hauling the unit around might allow one to stash everything in one place, but I keep mine in a harder case to prevent inadvertent damage. Instructions are OK. But for me, one of my bigger concerns is that I cannot tell much, if any, real difference among the nine settings.I had higher hopes but have tempered them to the point where I would say this unit is OK, and it may prove to have more value in the long run than I can find it right now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NSTS07UJH5C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVPNZXU#wasThisHelpful","R2NSTS07UJH5C4","A1S7BFT0HDF3HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7BFT0HDF3HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is easy to access and store gear in this case, and the bright orange neon helps you spot it on the floor of your car, inside a tent, or on a hotel bed.The mesh storage inside the lid could be a bit deeper and expand a bit more, but it does offer a place to store curled up cords for various uses. I do not use mine to store any sorts of foods and would not recommend keeping food or liquids inside a case with electronics. In short, I use this case pretty much everyday and have road-tested it on car trips and flights. It works fine for my purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SPZOHFSL7LX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIDKMOM#wasThisHelpful","R1SPZOHFSL7LX","A1S7BFT0HDF3HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7BFT0HDF3HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is my take on these JOOLA iPong Seamless Poly Pro 40+ Table Tennis Training Balls, which are sold and shipped in a pack of 80. These new plastic polystyrene 'poly' table tennis balls are fine for the sort of casual ping pong we play. The manufacturer makes claims that these balls are rounder than those make from celluloid and that they last longer, bounce higher, and are environmentally safer.Perhaps they are actually rounder, but how can this statement be verified? Does the process for molding and shaping the plastic work better? If they are rounder, what exactly will the average player gain or lose as a result?I would support the claim that these last longer. They are a bit harder to crush than traditional table tennis balls. And 80 of these are going to last us for a very long time.They do seem to bounce a bit higher than either the orange JOOLA training table tennis balls or the STIGA three star table tennis balls I compared them with. I dropped them from an equal height onto the ping pong table, all three at once and in pairs. There is no way this test is truly scientifically valid, but it was clear these seemed to bounce just a tad higher.JOOLA really lost me, however, claiming that these plastic table tennis balls are environmentally safer. Nothing that adds more plastic to the world can be mentioned with any straight-faced claim of environmental safety. If you have doubts, check out any number of sites documenting how clogged our oceans and beaches are with plastic. (The Drifters Project at http://driftersproject.net/about/ is a good entry point.)I am happy with these table tennis balls. I think they may outperform the other ones I mentioned previously. They bounce well and seem durable. But I am so sick and tired of being force-fed misinformation about environmental stewardship from the corporate world, I will only give these three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AD7ZVYVSOD8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4OO398#wasThisHelpful","R3AD7ZVYVSOD8X","A1S7BFT0HDF3HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7BFT0HDF3HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must say the quality of this Zwilling J.A. Henckels nail clippers surprised me. This is a precision-machined set of clippers that snips keratin cleanly and easily. The metal feels cool and refined, instilling one with the confidence of a Samurai attending to matters of hygiene. These clippers store in a handy hard plastic case that makes it easier to find them in a shaving kit or bathroom drawer.I acknowledge that these are not inexpensive. But how many pairs of cheap clippers have you bought and thrown away already? These seem built to last, and if they fail, I will revisit this review and document how long they lasted. In short, recommended because of their all-around quality.

"I needed a camera bag for my Canon, and the Canon 200DG Digital Camera Gadget Bag now fulfills that role. My camera and a telephoto lens nestle inside, along with the battery charger, a small flashlight, and a notebook. I can stash my portable music player and tablet inside along with a guide book.There are a number of zippered compartments and pockets, so this bag, which is decently padded, functions fine as the smaller carry-on item for a flight.The overlarge metal buckles, snaps, and ringlets are a step up from plastics but some folks might think them showy. I did at first but have since started liking them better.

"Beyond the name, which admittedly sounds alluring, there is just nothing right about melding of flavors. The chocolate tries in vain to break free from the smothering artificial mango flavor. It cannot. The fake fruit flavor rushes to the front of one's taste buds before lodging stubbornly across the roof of one's mouth, lingering like a horde of bats clinging to the bottom of a bridge. The actually peppery, sweet taste of mango might have worked with the dark chocolate, but there is none of that subtle flavor beneath this wrapper.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XUSEDRH92Z2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K269M9W#wasThisHelpful","R2XUSEDRH92Z2N","A1S7BFT0HDF3HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7BFT0HDF3HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's perhaps, but not entirely fair, to cast backwards and compare ""Strange Tales"" with its predecessor ""Lonesome Dreams."" Regardless, this second offing from Lord Huron suffers by comparison. The earnest yearning that fueled the wander in everyone's souls from the bands earlier recording shimmered throughout the songs, and Ben Schneider nailed that tone perfectly.This album is a different beast altogether, more a nod toward the spookier things that lurk just out of view or thought, but it's performed with a rockabilly style that is fun to listen to and likely to get you out of your seat at least a few times when cranked. The performance, though, seems smothered under too thick a layer of production that just goes just where one expects it to. The twists and turns on the first album added a bit of texture needed here.Perhaps what really bothers me is that this album could have been better if the band or producers had not tried too hard to make it sound like its predecessor. Or maybe it is that the songs about death, and like on the first CD there are several, seem old hat here. Worse, the perfunctory layering of those signature wordless background vocals from ""Lonesome Dreams"" show up here, feeling out of place.Sometimes the songs here do work and sound original, e.g, The World Ender. There are some other songs here that clearly have their lineage in the earlier session, and with a bit less polish, those could be gems. My inevitable cast backward colors my view on this one. I actually wish I had heard this one first. Strangely, I would liked it better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ7VDIMYEQ17Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TD5RSCG#wasThisHelpful","RZ7VDIMYEQ17Y","A1S7BFT0HDF3HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S7BFT0HDF3HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There were NONE.  You just place this tiny little ball shaped pill in her mouth between the cheek and the gum line.  That's it.  No swallowing needed or required.The following day she had her appetite back and ate normally...later her stools were much improved, but still loose.

"This strip was recommended in a BUlk Reef Supply video on YouTube. It's nice and heavy duty and has worked great in the 3 months we've had it. BUT... I currently have two aquariums running off the one strip (one will be broken down after the livestock is transferred from the other) and last night we had our first bad weather of the season, with high winds causing brownouts. Each time the lights flickered, 4 in total, the strip would turn off and not turn back on so I'd have to reset it to get the tanks working again. I don't know if this is just this strip or all GFCI strips and outlets, but anyone relying on one of these for their reef should be aware that once the power goes out, the tank will be powerless until a human comes along and pushes the button on the strip. I work 75+ minutes away from home so that's definitely an issue for me and I'm going to do some research now on possible solutions.

"As soon as I found out this pen could use G2 refills, I made the logical leap that if a G2 could fit a Montblanc refill with very slight modification, so could this pen.Sure enough, by sanding down the plastic cap on a Montblanc refill just a little it fit into the Metropolitan perfectly. The sanding can be accomplished with a regular emery board. Just shave it down a little, try for fit, and repeat as necessary.I love that I get the great writing experience of the Fineliner in a pen I'm not afraid to lose (though I would still mourn a little for the loss of a great pen, even at the Metropolitan's low price).

"I recently received my stylus and as others have said, the tip is big and squashy.

The pressure sensitivity works as advertised.

"I currently have small 3 dogs who have each eaten Stella & Chewy's since they were adopted, and an immunocompromised foster puppy who's been on it since she came to us a few weeks ago.Barley is 2.5 and has been eating it since he was a puppy. He has PERFECT teeth, a coat like molten silver, and crystal clear eyes. His weight is perfect and he's never gassy (which is great because he sleeps practically on my head sometimes).Mr. Growley was 4-5 when we adopted him almost 2 years ago and had an itchy coat, constant gas, and some tooth tartar and decay. Since he's been with us his skin has cleared up, his coat is snow white and thick and soft, he doesn't have gas (thank god), and the tartar on his teeth has actually gotten better without any brushing or dental work.Molly was 5 pounds when we got her, somewhat emaciated, and was supposed to be 2 years old. Since she's been with us, just over a year, she grew 4 pounds (!!!) and is a stocky, but not fat, little bundle of bossy energy. We're assuming she was younger than 2 and had some growing to do, but the difference is amazing.All 3 of the dogs have great breath (for dogs) and very firm, not stinky poop. Being small dogs they sometimes have accidents in the house but you can NEVER tell it's happened by the smell - it doesn't smell at all (weird, huh!). You don't know until you see it.Baby Girl is a foster and has been with us for about a month (she belongs to the rescue Leave No Paws Behind). She's about 10 months old and came to us eating whatever the vet was feeding her. She has a genetic immune disorder called dermatomyositis. Her skin was in terrible shape, her eyes were inflamed and runny, and she was very underweight. She had significant hair loss in certain places too. Demodectic mange was ruled out. For the first week I fed her canned puppy food trying to get some weight on her. She STANK. She was so gassy that she'd fart when she squatted to pee. She had runny poop. It was really gross. I decided to hell with the cost and put her on Stella & Chewy's. She wouldn't eat the frozen, but went crazy for the freeze-dried. Almost right away the gas and runny poop stopped and her eyes cleared up and looked less inflamed and her skin got much less red. After the first bag was done I switched her to a different brand (I and I Love You) and the results were disastrous. Within a day or two she was itching and scratching, her eyes were gummy, and worse, her skin was breaking out again in little sores and scabs. It was bad enough that I took her in to the vet just to check.I threw the rest of the bag of that food and put her back on Stella & Chewy's. Within a day or two she had vastly improved, her skin had returned to a light pink instead of red and begun to heal, and her eyes were bright and clear and she was back to her energetic puppy self.Luckily she has now started to eat the frozen version, so that will reduce the cost by about half, but I'll keep the freeze-dried on hand just in case.I just cannot say enough good things about Stella & Chewy's. I was laid off a few months ago so money is tight, but we decided this is one place where we will not skimp. There is just such a difference in the dogs' condition (for the better) when they're eating Stella & Chewy's.Disclaimer: I am NOT affiliated with Stella & Chewy's and have never received anything from them.

"I heard that Blu-Tack was wonderful for lifting graphite from paper, all the way back to nearly white (important if you need to recover highlights, catchlights in eyes, etc.) I couldn't find it locally so I ordered it from Amazon. In the meantime I tried a couple of other brands of putty, including Aleen's Craft Putty from a big chain craft store that starts with M and ends with ichaels. Comparing the two, Blu-tack does work well enough but the Aleen's really outshines it. It's a bit firmer, which matters when you're shaping it, and it's MUCH tackier. Even when they are both dirty I can tell the difference by the way it feels. Aleen's does a better job of pulling graphite.So in a nutshell, Blu-Tack does work well but it's not the best, hence 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8AHK43X445VJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FGLX72#wasThisHelpful","R8AHK43X445VJ","A360104XRFH2SE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A360104XRFH2SE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are just as smooth as the other two and a pleasure to draw with.Now, I don't think I *needed* these, since the difference in the hardness really isn't very drastic - they say the Pearl is between a Blackwing and a 602, but you can easily get a range that's as light as a 602 and nearly as dark as a Blackwing (which is about a 4B equivalent). So I still keep sticking the 602 in my HB pencil block, and the Blackwing in the 4B block, and the Pearl sits in the 2B and hardly gets used.

Not even a faint line where the masking tape was around the design.Now to see if I can get my money back... what a waste of time!------------------------------------------------------------------A ha!

Fran has brought her young children, and Roland has brought his new, sophisticated wife and his moody fifteen-year-old daughter. Alice has brought her former boyfriendâs 20-year-old son, Kasim. Discoveries are made. Feelings ignite. The children make a gruesome, secret discovery. Alice and Fran are not sure that Rolandâs new wife will fit in with their more ordinary lifestyles. Harriet feels safe enough with Rolandâs new wife to reveal a deep, dark secret. And, of course, Kasim and Rolandâs daughter explore their attraction to one another.This author writes very well, and some interesting plots are developed.

It would have been much more effective with a common thread somewhere along the way, somehow drawing in the entire family.Some of the characters are well developed and realistic, while others seem under-developed and one-dimensional.

"I have been using a competitors BB cream, and I have liked the results. These foundation-creams seem to lie on top of the skin, masking wrinkles. Ordinary foundations seem to accentuate the wrinkles by sinking into them.This particular BB cream has a higher SPF, 25. That is good, because the sunâs rays can accelerate to wrinkle formation. The only problem is that this foundation must be kept away from the eyes, because it does irritate eyes and burn. This creates a problem for women like me, who apply foundation to the eyelids and under-eye area, in order to create a more uniform âcanvasâ with which to work.This cream does seem to nourish the skin, making it softer.

Her father does not have the heart to empty it out and put it up for sale, so it is up to Rachel.

"Maureen Pascal is in Jerusalem researching a book. When she feels compelled to enter a shop, she is mysteriously drawn to an unusual and very ancient ring. Surprisingly, after she tries it on, he gives her the ring, saying that it belongs to her. Maureen is confused. The mystery deepens, when, later, she receives a puzzling invitation to the Languedoc region of southern France.This is an exciting mystery based on the subject matter of Dan Brownâs THE DAVINCI CODE and Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincolnâs HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL. This one, however, is centered on Maureen, a fictional character and part of Mary Magdaleneâs bloodline. Similar information is in all three of the books mentioned above, but this one is enjoyable and exciting just the same. It is fun to read as Maureen visits the famous sites of the Languedoc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PYP4CKMP44K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JMKONM#wasThisHelpful","R1PYP4CKMP44K","A35CCGJDNXUDY9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35CCGJDNXUDY9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love all of Deva Premal's work. This particular CD seems to be more musically complex with more intricate layering of instruments, voice, and natural sounds. It does, however, seem to feature Miten much more. Deva is featured as the main vocalist in only two pieces. This is where the CD falls short. Deva's fluid and ethereal voice and her authentic, genuine spirituality are what make her other CDs so very special, have so much impact.

"Katherine has been told that she has only months to live. Confused as to how she should spend those few remaining months, she remembers a sale ad in the newspaper describing a remote but scenic cabin in the woods. She decides to buy it sight unseen. When she finally decides to move in, she can barely make it up the path to the isolated cabin she is so ill. However, she does make it, and discovers silence and peace. At first, the emptiness is terrifying, but she figures that she is dying anyway. But is she alone? Is it her imagination that she feels something breathing on the other side of her cabinâs stone wall each night as she drifts into a troubled sleep?This is a unique and unforgettable story! This author writes beautifully, poetically creating breath-taking imagery of Katherineâs forest. The author is equally successful at creating sheer terror, loneliness, and many other human emotions so vividly that the reader finds herself experiencing them, too. Some parts of this novel are difficult to read. However, each part, beautiful or ugly, adds to a perfect and complete composite that is this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UH60PFBYKDC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804176957#wasThisHelpful","R2UH60PFBYKDC4","A35CCGJDNXUDY9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35CCGJDNXUDY9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Due to its wonderful health benefits, I use coconut oil everyday. Coconut oil helps regulate the blood sugar, and it is healthful for the brain. It aids in digestion and in absorbing fat-soluble vitamins. It is cholesterol free. It can help in weight loss, and it seems to slow the progression of Alzheimerâs. It is also an effective moisturizer for skin and hair. So, of course, I was eager to try Vita Cocoâs product. Because I have tried many other brands of coconut oil, I had very high expectations for this oil.This product is of excellent quality. I used it for frying, and it left the fish fillets crisp and delicious. This particular brand of coconut oil has a more pronounced, more delicious aroma than most others. It is wonderful! As far as moisturizing, this product is excellent. And the price for this product is very reasonable. I highly recommend this brand of coconut oil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WWG44C1ESF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9IMNKA#wasThisHelpful","R30WWG44C1ESF2","A35CCGJDNXUDY9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35CCGJDNXUDY9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Because I am interested Ayurvedic practices of naturally achieving wellness and health through balance, I was very interested in these capsules. Consequently, I researched the herbs with which I was unfamiliar, to find out what these capsules were actually going to do.I already knew that tumeric, primarily an anti-inflammatory, is also suspected as being very effective in keeping the brain healthy and slowing down its aging.Upon researching Bacopa, I found that tests have proven increased retention of learning as a result of taking Bacopa. (See Chronic Effects of Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri) on Human Memory by  Steven Roodenrys Ph.D, et all.)Ashwagandha is another herb I had not heard of before. It is an anti-inflammatory that is believed to relax the brain. Many sources I consulted claimed that it has rejuvenating properties. Many believe it helps in concentration.Each of these herbs has other suspected positive side effects as well. Sadly, they also have suspected adverse side effects, ranging from abdominal cramping to heart palpitations.My experience with Sundownâs product was that the capsules are easy enough to take. Although normal-sized, they are not difficult to swallow. It is, however, difficult to say, after taking them for nearly two weeks, if these capsules have made a difference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCBPRRT1AXW26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUHD0QW#wasThisHelpful","RCBPRRT1AXW26","A35CCGJDNXUDY9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35CCGJDNXUDY9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Amelia is raising her six-year-old son, Samuel, alone. Her husband died in a car accident, while driving Amelia to the hospital to give birth to Samuel. Consequently, Samuelâs birthday is not something that Amelia likes to celebrate. Samuel is a real handful. At the beginning of the movie, he is kicked out of his school for inappropriate behavior. Amelia and Samuel are rarely invited to childrenâs parties, because he is so violent with the other children.Each night, Amelia reads Samuel a bedtime story. One night, after allowing Samuel to choose the book, he chooses The Babadook. The premise of the childrenâs book is that once you know about this monster, the more he will plague you. The more you ignore him, the more difficult he is to get rid of. Of course, Amelia and Samuel have read the book, so there is no getting rid of the Babadook.I love scary stories, but I did not find this one frightening. Too often, it seemed to miss its mark. It was very disjointed, leaving the audience to wonder what was actually happening at times. Some of the special effects were interesting, but then they feel short. I expected a lot from this movie, and it certainly failed to live up to my expectations.Now, what I did like about the movie. The message here, ironically, seems to be that love does conquer all.

"I take fish oil each day, for a healthy heart and eyes, for improved digestion, to boost fat burning, for healthy bones, and to heighten my brainpower. There are many other benefits of taking fish oil as well. So, as you can imagine, I jumped at the chance to get a free sample of Eklundâs Essential Omega.  This highly concentrated Norwegian fish oil delivers 800 mg of fish oil per capsule. Each capsule also contains 430 mg of EPA and 290 mg DHA, both of which are important for health. In spite of all of this, I was happy to find that they are still easy to swallow.What I like best about Eklundâs brand is its testing and retesting of its productsâ purity. Some of the things they test for are PCBs heavy metals, and pesticides, things that we really do not want in our tablets!This fish oil is in the highly digestible, easily absorbed triglyceride form.

Suddenly, he finds himself in a strange bed, with a 13-year-old girl snoring in a chair at his bedside. He discovers that he has died and has begun his afterlife. But heaven is not as he had always imagined it would be. As Boo explores his new and unfamiliar world, he assumes that his holey heart has finally killed him.

Oren, Joryâs and Graceâs professor father, fearing for his emotional wifeâs well-being, sends the two sisters to a house he bought for them. They are to live on their own. Thatâs when things get interesting!I loved these characters, especially our main character, Jory. She is so human, yet she tries so hard. She is loving and kind, but she is also a typical teenager with the drives and problems of a teenager. I could not put this book down! Something was always happening.Ms Brelinski writes so well that the words flow before the reader, enticing the reader to read and read and read. Her settings are vivid, and her characters are extremely well developed.

"These Tibetan Extra Large Wild Horse Prayer Flags are the perfect touch for our backyard meditation garden. They are bright and colorful in the traditional colors. As they blow in the breeze, they add a hopeful and peaceful feeling to a space. These cover a very large area and are much longer than the normal string of prayer flags. They flap easily in the breeze and are easily tied down with the attached cord. This company delivered our prayer flags very quickly. I am very happy with these prayer flags.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O2LVSYTBPDIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003S9ZXPM#wasThisHelpful","R2O2LVSYTBPDIZ","A35CCGJDNXUDY9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35CCGJDNXUDY9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the record, I did not purchase this item on Amazon. I traded in my old XB1 at GameStop for the Elite bundle when they were running a promotion, which comes with this controller.Iâll get right to it, this thing is AWESOME! After playing with this controller for a dozen hours or so it feels like a serious downgrade trying to go back to my original XB1 controller. Iâm not saying the original controller is terrible, itâs a really good controller, itâs just that this one is so much better that it makes the old one feel more like a toy.Upon holding this controller for the first time I immediately noticed the (far) superior build quality. Everything here feels premium, from the ridiculously smooth analog sticks to the stainless steel triggers and paddles. The textured surface feels great, the controller weighs about 100 grams more so it has a bit more heft (which I like), itâs by far the best feeling controller Iâve ever held, but that doesnât mean much if it doesnât perform well.Thankfully this controller performs extremely well! Buttons are nice and crisp, triggers and sticks are smooth, everything works about as good as you might expect from a device in this range.This controller comes with a bunch of features. You can swap out your analog sticks for taller or dome shaped sticks, the d-pad is swappable, the triggers have locks which will cut their travel down by about half (which is great for FPS games with semiautomatic weapons), two profiles can be loaded on the controller and are easily toggled via switch, it has a headphone jack (which is now included in the newer stock controllers), and many of the parts being made of stainless steel means that this controller should last a long while.If you are new to custom style controllers which have buttons/paddles on the bottom then it might take some getting used to. Thereâs a bit of a learning curve because now fingers which I never used much (my middle finger and ring finger) are being used a lot more and developing good coordination with these fingers takes a bit of time. Iâm no longer moving my right thumb off the analog stick to press face buttons, now each finger has a designated action, and coordinating all of this was tougher than I though it would be, at least for me, but the payoff is certainly worth it. I recommend starting with just one paddle, then integrating more as you become used to it.This thing is literally a game changer. Not having to move my thumb off the right analog stick to press face buttons just feels so perfect. It sounds minor, but the difference is really quite significant. This allows me to do things like jump and aim at the same time without having to contort my hand or use control configurations that arenât right in other ways, I can configure this controller exactly how I want, and my fingers being constantly rested on these paddles means I can perform face button actions instantly and accurately.For example, for Halo 5 I have it configured so that one paddle is for jumping, one is for dashing, one is for reloading and the other is for sprinting. I also configured it so that pressing the left stick down (L3) is for crouching and R3 is for swapping weapons. Right bumper is set for melee, left is for grenade, my right trigger is for shooting (with hair trigger switch active), left trigger is for aiming (which hair trigger switch inactive - I like the longer pull for aiming, personally). I also use the taller stick on the right. For me this is the perfect control scheme, I donât have to ever touch a face button during gameplay, all my fingers are rested directly on the buttons at all times. The great thing is that you too can find your perfect control scheme! You can store two active configurations on the controller and (I believe) 255 configurations on the system. Itâs very easy to use the XBOX Accessories application to swap out the active configurations on your controller. Want Witcher 3 to play more like Dark Souls where the triggers are used for attack/guard? You can do that! The level of customization is a bit daunting at first, but after playing around for a bit Iâm sure youâll find the perfect scheme that works for you.Iâm really struggling to think of any negatives for this product. I hear that some people are experiencing drifting, and that some of the internal parts are the same as the original controller so they might not be as robust, but since Iâm not experiencing any issues I canât mark it down. Of course, as with any product, some people will get lemons, thankfully that wasnât the case for me.One complaint Iâm seeing around the net is that this uses AAs and doesnât have an internal battery like other controllers such as the newest iteration of the DualShock for PS4. I much rather it use AAs because internal batteries tend to hold a very short charge (I can go all week with AAs), and once the internal battery goes out then you either have to keep it plugged in, buy a new controller, or find a way to fix it which might be a pain. With AAs itâs simple and Iâll never have these issues. I like using Eneloop rechargeable batteries because they last nearly as long as AAs, have a ton of charge cycles, and a great shelf life.So is it worth it? HECK YES! If youâre a competitive gamer or a serious hobbyist, or you just like awesome toys, then this thing is for you. $150 is a LOT to ask, especially for a controller, but this controller is that good and it justifies the cost in my opinion. Itâs in a completely different league than any other controller Iâve ever used, and now that Iâm used to it I just canât go back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FCQFUFDU7P4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZDNNRB8#wasThisHelpful","R1FCQFUFDU7P4W","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a tough one to review. On one hand I really like the the interface itself. Itâs incredibly durable, has a fantastic build quality/design, and it captures audio incredibly well for an interface in this price range, but on the other hand Mackie has really gone downhill with customer service and support.Prior to this I was using a Presonus AudioBox, but the pre-amps are weak and it injected noise into my signal. The AudioBox was also $100, but the Blackjack is clearly superior in most respects. The only pros for the AudioBox is that it has MIDI in/out and the Blackjack does not, and also with the AudioBox I could plug it into any USB power source (such as a phone charger) and use it as a headphone amp but the Blackjack needs to be hooked up to a computer, though this wonât make a difference for most people because most will want it to be connected to a computer anyway, my circumstances are definitely an edge case.I see some reviewers complaining about a hissing noise though I do not experience this at all. I can easily get a really strong and natural sounding signal. This box is definitely built like a tank! My AudioBox feels very cheap in comparison. I really like the tilted design with controls on the front and ins/outs on the back. This thing is simplicity in its finest!The design/engineering is great, but itâs almost like their engineering team and software/support teams are all on completely different planets. If you do any research you will see that this device was plagued with driver issues which were completely ignored by Mackie for almost a year. It took two years before they were able to release a usable driver. I see a couple reviewers here trying to blame the driver issues on the customers, but itâs clear that the customers were not at fault, itâs just that many of these negative reviews were created when this device was having these issues. Itâs quite easy to do a little searching and go back in time on the web to see how bad these problems were (they were bad).I contacted Mackie about future driver support and they responded saying that they will only officially support up to Windows 7 or OS X 10.7. OS X 10.7 is Lion, which was released way back in 2011! Mackie even said in their email that they havenât tested the device on newer operating systems. This is bogus because you can still find this interface in retail stores, if theyâre going to keep selling it brand new via retail then they should at least support the OSs that people are currently using!Luckily Iâm running this with OS X which doesnât usually require drivers for these sort of things (thanks to Core Audio) therefor I shouldnât see a problem for at least awhile (working fine for me on Yosemite 10.10.5), but if youâre using Windows then be warned that Mackie simply doesnât care about future driver support so if the aging drivers fail to work in the future then this thing is pretty much a brick, unless you want to use unsupported (and often very buggy and/or laggy) drivers.The interface itself is an easy five stars. This thing is awesome for the price, but these type of products extend past hardware alone and because Mackie is so apathetic with their customer support and they continue to sell these brand new knowing they donât support current OSs, I must remove a star out of principle, and I nearly removed two.If you are using a Mac then this is a choice worth considering, drivers arenât usually a problem, but if you are running Windows then beware! It may work now, but after an OS update you maybe SOL, I donât think itâs worth the risk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N6I000GCLG7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VZG550#wasThisHelpful","R3N6I000GCLG7F","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I donât do a whole lot of live gigging so my main use for this is home recording.For me one of the most difficult things to achieve in a home recording situation (especially in an apartment) is getting a great bass guitar sound. For lead/rhythm guitar Iâve had a lot of luck by just using a Shure SM-57 micâd up to a decent Marshall combo. Though not ideal, I can even get away with using an SM-57 for vocals if I do a little post-processing, and for drums I just use the bundled sampled drum kits that come with Logic Pro X (or even the drummer AI), which sound pretty awesome with minimal fuss, but the bass guitar has always been an incredibly weak area for me and I would spend hours upon hours trying to get it right.My main bass is an American Fender P-Bass which already has a nice tone, but when I plug directly into my recording interface it just doesnât have enough âoomphâ to stand out in most mixes and it always sounds amateurish. In the right context the bass alone can work (with a little post-processing), but for real energetic rock mixes my bass tracks always felt very distant and stale, and since bass often provides much of the soul that meant my mixes as a whole sounded pretty stale.My normal work-around was to plug directly into the interface and then do a whole lot of post processing with compression, software amplifiers, and various plugins to try and get âthat toneâ, but it always sounded like I was trying to polish a turd and the end results usually sounded unnatural. It took a lot of fudging around to get something even remotely passable. Ideally I want to do as little post processing as possible, itâs resource intensive and itâs easy to overdo it and kill the life of the mix.It started to look like I was going to have to bite the bullet and spend a TON of money on a really nice bass head/cab setup and microphone(s) to get the sound I wanted, but weâre talking thousands of dollars to really get it right (and probably some ticked-off neighbors!). I finally discovered this pedal and was extremely skeptical of all the praise it receives (Iâm a bit of a cynic), but I ran to Guitar Center and grabbed one of these, figuring I could return it if it just wasnât for me.Iâm now convinced that the engineers at Tech 21 are aliens from another planet that somehow managed to build a darn near perfect Ampeg SVT in a tiny box with all analog components. This thing just sounds SO GOOD!When I first hooked it up I used the SVT settings that were outlined in the manual. With the pedal turned off I strummed around on the bass, I then engaged the pedal, strummed a few notes, my hair literally stood up on end and I got goosebumps because the tone I was hearing sounded so awesome! With a little tweaking I was able to dial it in and get it just right. My bass tracks now sound 50X better and take a fraction of the time to build.This little box is deceptively versatile. Itâs great for getting that iconic SVT tone, but you can also turn the blend all the way down and use it as an active EQ (which is great for my passive P Bass). It can be used as an overdrive pedal, or as a DI right into the mixing board. It has a parallel out which is great for monitoring in a live situation, and it also has an XLR output which will convert an unbalanced signal to a balanced XLR signal (this means a nice clean signal that can travel long distances without introducing line noise and such). It also accepts phantom power via the XLR port. A bit of tweaking can really dial in that perfect sound, and it doesnât take much knob turning to really change things up.This pedal really does help make any low quality amp sound a lot better. In my apartment Iâve been using a tiny Orange combo amp which isnât even a bass amp and it only has a 6 inch speaker. It was gifted to me and I only ever use it for practice, just so I can hear my bass. I threw the SansAmp in between my bass and this tiny amp, flattened the EQ on the combo and was absolutely blown away by what I was hearing! Obviously weâre working within the confines of physics so a cheap 1X6 combo can only do so much, but the SansAmp really transformed it from something lifeless into something that actually sounds like a tiny bass amp with great tone! Apartment-style living room jams have never sounded so good!Iâm hearing that many bass guitarists are now going straight from the SansAmp and right into the PA system in live gig situations and getting awesome results. I would never have believed that this pedal alone could even come close to standing up against a micâd head/cab, but now Iâm a believer. Also, the sound guy will probably love you because all they will likely have to do is turn the EQ knobs to 12:00 and let this tiny workhorse do its thing.I had a hard time deciding between this one and the 3 channel programmable version which is only $10 more. I ended up sticking with this version because itâs super compact and has a parallel out (unfortunately the non-deluxe programmable version is lacking this feature). Iâm also the type of person that finds a great tone and sticks with it, but if youâre the type of person who wants to change things up with the press of a button then I would look at the programmable version. I love that this thing fits right in my guitar case.Iâm having a hard time coming up with any negatives. The only thing I can really think of is that this might not work for you if youâre not into SVT or tube style tones. You can create a surprising array of tones with this pedal, but it will always have a tube/SVT quality, which for me is an awesome, but tone is a very personal thing so it will not work for all bass guitarists.Iâm annoyingly picky with gear and was expecting to be let down, thankfully this little magical box greatly exceeded my expectations. There are two tools that have drastically improved my home studio - the Shure SM-57 microphone and the SansAmp Bass Driver. I almost feel like Iâm cheating by using this pedal because itâs so simple and so effective!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R283741CL2TD61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002D0EN8#wasThisHelpful","R283741CL2TD61","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâve been slowly building my own personal âhot rodâ go-anywhere CX bike. For this build Iâm going for pure awesomeness, so Iâm carefully picking each component. The requirements for each component are simple: they have to function really well and they have to look awesome.Next up was the seatpost. I mulled over a bunch of various seatposts for a couple days. Should I go for carbon? Should I go for aluminum? What brand should I get? What color? During my search I kept coming across Thomson, which seems to be the gold standard for a really solid no frills yet still awesome seatpost, so I ordered one.This thing is perfect! The craftsmanship, quality and finish are way above average. I really dig how easy it is to adjust the saddle angle. With seatposts in the past I always had a problem getting it just right but with the Thomson itâs painlessly simple. I canât figure out why this isnât the standard way to set the angle, other seatposts overcomplicate it and make adjusting cumbersome.Yeah, the Elite isnât the lightest seatpost, but whatever, this build isnât about that. This is a finely crafted piece that will likely outlast me, even if I wreck my bike a few times. Next Iâm going to swap out my stem and you better believe Iâm going with a Thomson (likely the X4).If you donât mind plunking down a bit more cash for something you can truly be proud of then I highly recommend considering a Thomson. This is one of the easiest 5-stars Iâve ever given, and Iâm the annoyingly picky type.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23BQHTMK2EQ4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016DAHWQ#wasThisHelpful","R23BQHTMK2EQ4S","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I put this crankset on my single speed cyclocross bike. The carbon is definitely a bit lighter than the alloy crankset I had before and it looks really good on my bike (aside from the blemishes mentioned below). Honestly, itâs really hard for me to tell if this crankset actually âfeelsâ better than my previous one, but I figured this would be the case going in. Really I picked this crankset for the âblingâ factor if Iâm being honest.There are two somewhat minor issues though. First is that you will need a torx T25 screwdriver so you can remove the right crank arm in order to properly mount/dismount a chainring onto the spider. If you look at the image Amazon provides you will see that the crank arm completely covers one of the bolts and itâs near impossible to access this and apply proper torque without removing the crank arm from the spider. Unfortunately no T25 tool is provided.The other issue is that the carbon on my crank arms is somewhat blemished. Unfortunately that just seems to be how it is. Originally I was sent the wrong version (received BB30 instead of GXP). I noticed that the crank arms were blemished and when I received the corrected GXP version I noticed the same thing. In fact, if you zoom in and look at the image Amazon provides (during the time of this review) you will see these blemishes. Mine actually looks a little better than the Amazon image, but the minor blemishes are definitely visible. Of course blemishes are going to happen over time as I ride my bike, but it would have been nice if these looked brand new for at least a little while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R165244JXTCJ25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMP89TA#wasThisHelpful","R165244JXTCJ25","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tend to use fenders only in wet conditions so I wanted something that can easily be attached/detached. This fender was my first solution and I eventually also purchased a set of SKS Raceblades, but the Raceblades are more complimentary than a replacement.I've had this fender for a little over three years now and is has gone through thousands of commuting miles. This thing is easily adjustable so it fits pretty much any bike, it's very lightweight and it's super easy to attach/detach. A fender is a must in wet weather riding lest you prefer an oily enema, which I don't.There are a couple compromises that come with this fender though. The biggest for me its that it eats up a lot of room on my seatpost which makes fitting a wedge pack on one of my bikes pretty much impossible and on my other bike it's a super tight squeeze. I almost always commute with a backpack so I typically just throw my wedge pack in there, but I prefer having as little weight on my back as possible and I don't really like commuting with panniers. The other compromise is that since this is so easy to attach/detach it's also very easy to steal, so you'll likely have to bring it with you if you park your bike in the city. Luckily my employer allows me to keep my bicycle in my office so I don't find myself in too many situations where I need to lock my bike outside, but I can definitely see where this would be an annoyance for a lot of people.I also have SKS Raceblades which do a better job of giving me all the clearance I need on my seatpost and it looks more permanent at first glance which might deter some potential thieves, but it's a bit annoying to mount when I'm in a rush and it's significantly more expensive (~$60 for the set). If I'm in a situation where I'm going to need a fender for more than a couple days then I prefer using the Raceblades, however, if I just need something quick and super temporary then I prefer the X-Tra Dry fender for its ease of use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IETRXJ1OKM3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X61N2A#wasThisHelpful","R2IETRXJ1OKM3M","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâm in the process of building my idea of the perfect commuter bike. Deciding on pedals was very tough! I spent more time on the pedals than I did deciding on both which crankset to buy and what wheelset to build, mainly because safety plus convenience is such a huge concern of mine and pedals play a significant role.On my previous commuter I started with basic cheap flat pedals but I had issues where my foot would slip off on occasion, especially in wet conditions. On one instance I nearly slipped off my bike while riding in heavy rainfall in the middle of traffic, so I purchased SPD âcliplessâ pedals to secure myself to the bike (I still hate the term âcliplessââ¦ you clip in darn it!) Anyway, from a safety perspective these things are great! I never once had my foot slip off while clipped in. However, clipless pedals are very inconvenient to deal with if youâre commuting around town because you either have to drag along an extra pair of shoes, or walk around in bicycle shoes, which is quite annoying, especially if you will be walking any significant distance at all. I then purchased pedals that are SPD on one side and flat on the other. This sounds like itâs the best of both worlds, but really itâs half-arsed in both respects and I tended to use the flat side more often than the clipless side, but I started to worry about safety a bit because the flat pedal side was very sub-par for flat pedals.I also started to develop knee/leg pains with SPD pedals because my foot is secured in one position and one position only. I spent quite a bit of money having my bike fitted by multiple bike shops, but no matter what I tried I would eventually develop knee/leg issues which would go away when I would use the flat side.After a bunch of research I finally settled on the Saints for my new commuter. These things are sturdy, they are user serviceable and they provide a ton of grip! WAY more grip than previous flat pedals Iâve used, itâs almost like velcro on my feet! These pedals feel very solid and I like how they are nice and wide, I really feel like I can dig down into the pedals when Iâm tackling tough hills. You can adjust the amount of grip by adding/removing washers. I ended up removing all the washers for maximum grip and Iâll probably keep them this way, but the option is nice. I like how Shimano included a bunch of extra pins and washers for future replacement.For commuting purposes these are the best pedals Iâve ever owned. I feel like I get the safety benefits of clipless pedals but without the aforementioned negatives. These pedals do weigh a bit more than average but thatâs a small tradeoff which Iâm more than happy to live with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RWZ7YIU5BORS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Q4PBO8#wasThisHelpful","R3RWZ7YIU5BORS","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are definitely better than the standard microfiber cloths you get with glasses and and such. Most microfiber cloths I run across feel a bit thin and 'papery' in comparison. One issue I've had with the standard cloths is that they don't really clean things such as larger screens all that well. It might be tough to notice when the screen is on, but when it's black I'll often see a layer of streaks after using a standard cloth, and these streaks can be tough to remove. Eventually I went the route of using a spray cleaner meant for electronic displays, but I was having bad luck here as well. It's more cumbersome going this route and I was still having issues with streaks no matter how hard I tried.After doing a little searching around I found that these MagicFiber cloths are fairly popular with photographers, so I went ahead and ordered a pack of six.

"This is my backup light for a NiteRider 750.I was surprised how well this light holds up against its bigger brother. Obviously the 750 is brighter on max, but the difference is not quite as drastic as I thought it would be.Personally, I find 200 lumens to be quite adequate for most night commuting. What's great is that you'll get about 3 hours of burn time at 200 lumens which is very respectable for a light in this price range. I've owned quite a few lights in the past and the closest to this is my Cygolite Pace 300. The Pace 300 is a decent light, but I like the beam pattern on the NiteRider more. The beam throws out plenty of light, but it has just enough fill to allow for easy navigation on twisty trails. I actually find the Lumina 400/750 at 200 lumens to be more usable than my Pace 300 maxed out at 300 lumens (plus the battery lasts 3X longer). On its lowest setting (125 lumens) you'll get about 6 hours of burn time and it's still do-able for commuting, though I do outrun the light once I hit ~15 mph if it's pitch-dark out, but at less than 15 mph it's not bad at all.The build quality is great, the handlebar mount is rock solid, and everything seems nice and sturdy. Out of all the lights I've owned, the Lumina 750 is my absolute favorite, but the 400 is easily 2nd best. It's a good main handlebar light or a fantastic backup. Experience tells me that redundancy is a great thing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EJR5SFBVBOC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEWXIAC#wasThisHelpful","R1EJR5SFBVBOC5","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A little context to hopefully help prevent those from going the same route I did:My first light was a worthless ~$15 cheapie (don't remember the brand) which operated on AAA batteries, flickered while in use and fell apart within a few weeks of riding. It was also terribly weak and provided virtually no illumination.I quickly realized I needed something better, so I went for a Cygolite Pace 300. While it was much better than my first light, the USB port was designed poorly so the charging cable would constantly fall out while in the middle of charging (a common problem at the time judging by reviews, probably fixed in newer models). Also, the light was too focused making it tough to navigate twisty trails. The 300 lumens was adequate but running it on high drained the battery in an hour, which meant I was constantly charging it and on more than one occasion I was left out in the dark when my light died. On lower settings it just didn't provide enough light.I then ended up going for something much more beefy because I wanted more battery life so I went with a LuminTrek 1600 (now Lumintrail), which is basically a MagicShine clone. Thieves will steal anything on a bike, so I always felt obligated to remove both the light and the (bulky) external battery when I parked my bike in the city. It was cumbersome to deal with, especially if I didn't have a backpack on me. The rubber mounting ring was barely adequate and was just another small part to lose, also since it didn't mount the light very well my light would bobble up and down a bit while riding. Furthermore, this light was the opposite of my Cygolite in that it offered virtually no throw and was all fill, so despite being crazy bright it didn't really provide a whole lot of illumination where I needed it most and much of the light was wasted where I didn't need it. This is probably a good bar light if you have another light mounted on your head (especially for mountain biking) but I just grew tired of dealing with it.Finally I hit the proverbial jackpot with the Lumina 750. ~200 lumens is adequate for me if the beam pattern is right. I recommend overshooting lumen-wise when shopping for lights because you can always turn the light to a lower setting which means if you will get much better battery life than if you got a light which maxed out to the amount of lumens you desire. The 750 will run at 200 lumens for a very respectable 5.5 hours. The beam pattern is great, it's not too narrow like my Cygolite but it also doesn't waste a bunch of light like my LuminTrek. I very rarely need more than 200 lumens and when I do it's because I'm traveling at high speed in pitch dark (usually down a hill), so I can easily brighten it up for a few moments and revert it back to 200 lumens when I reach the bottom. I don't outrun this light at 200 lumens until I reach ~18-20 mph, which is fine for commuting.At full power this thing is BRIGHT! I could easily careen down a paved mountain road/trail if I wanted to. It's great to use at 750, but you'll only get about 1.5 hours of life (which is actually pretty good considering how ****ing bright it is). It's nice having so much battery life because I can do long night rides, or if I'm just doing general commuting (about an hour of riding in the dark for me) then I only have to charge my light about once a week rather than every single day.This light has a great build quality. I feel like I could pitch it at a brick wall and it would still come out fine. I really like how it charges via standard micro USB (which is much more common than the thicker mini USB cable my Cygolite uses). The mounting is rock solid, especially the handlebar mount, but the helmet mount is quite solid as well. I also like how they implemented the little rubber cover that protects the USB port. On my Cygolite it was directly on the back of the light and it would always pop off, which made me worry about moisture working its way in during wet weather riding. On the Lumina it's on the bottom where it's much less likely to get wet and it stays in place much better, I don't imagine it ever popping out.This is definitely my favorite light. In fact, I like it so much that I purchased the Lumina 400 as a backup. Experience tells me that redundancy is a great thing, especially when it comes to being able to see!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8T8HVLDOR1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEWKHCE#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8T8HVLDOR1V","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Extremely accurate! A good friend of mine has a Mitutoyo (a very high quality and expensive digital caliper), and after calibrating the dial on the Anytime version it was pretty much dead-on to the hundredth of a mm. I build bicycle wheels and maintain multiple bikes as well as help people maintain theirs so that's my primary use for this and for this purpose it is probably overkill, but I just couldn't pass it up for this price.The action on this tool is nice and smooth and it doesn't feel like a cheap knockoff. The included case is a little cheap-ish, but it's perfectly functional.

"The main reason I purchased this is because at work we are migrating some of our software over to iPad, so I needed something that I could test with as this is my first time writing code for IOS and emulators just won't do.I've never been in the market for a tablet device as they just don't really seem to fit my particular lifestyle. I'm a software developer so wherever I go my MacBook Pro goes, and as such I never saw the need for one. I always saw tablets as fantastic devices for those who travel a lot and those who do lighter productivity and basic tasks on the go (email, web surfing, video watching, etc), but don't want the burden of carrying a full-fledge laptop (a burden I'm all too familiar with!). A couple years ago I got a Nexus 7 tablet as a gift and it was novel at first, but it was just too clumsy for regular use, so I ended up re-gifting it to someone who would use it more than I.After spending some time with this I have to say that I really like it! I wouldn't call this an essential device, but it does have a spot in my home. The iPad Air is MUCH more enjoyable to use than my Nexus 7. One of my key concerns was tying, something that is almost always clumsy to do on devices like this, but rest assured that typing on this thing is absolutely great for what it is. On a standard keyboard I type between 80-90 WPM and on this device I type right at 40 WPM (in landscape mode), which is very acceptable. I'm HORRIBLE with typing on smartphones and on the Nexus 7 (below 20 WPM I'm sure with poor accuracy - I don't know how my wife does it so fast!).The touch screen and gestures are super accurate and they just feel right. I almost never experience lag or stuttering of any sort, though on very rare occasions I'll experience slight stuttering, such as when I'm going from a graphically intensive game back to the home screen, but it will quickly go back to being perfectly smooth.This thing is just fun to use! It's great to have laying around the house, or messing around with in the kitchen while looking up recipes, or taking to a coffee shop, or any time where you want a super portable device that will help you achieve basic computing/media consumption tasks. Smartphones work pretty well in these scenarios too, but having a larger screen really does make a significant difference when it comes to ease of use and enjoyability. I'm terribly clumsy on even the best smartphone (I just don't have the fingers for it I guess).For what it is, this is an five-star device. It's a great ""luxury"" toy that is very fun to use, but it doesn't really try to be anything else. Some may call this just a big iPhone, and really that's what it is, but while sitting around the house I'll definitely grab this device before I grab a smartphone because the added screen real estate makes a HUGE difference! It's also saving me from having to move my much bulkier MPB all over the place, a first world problem I suppose!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTYBEH26NYLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTWPEBK#wasThisHelpful","R1PTYBEH26NYLX","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm actually pretty surprised with how well this thing works, especially considering it's a bluetooth laser mouse for around $20!I use my laptop as a desktop replacement, a portable computer and even as my work computer at the office. I wanted a portable wireless solution for both my keyboard and mouse, but I didn't want to sacrifice one of my precious USB ports (my computer only has two and I don't want to use a hub), which means my only option was to go the bluetooth route.The only reason I was compelled to pick this one is because bluetooth options for mice are surprisingly limited. I use a MacBook Pro but I didn't really want to spend the money for an Apple branded ""magic mouse"" (which I find to be a bit uncomfortable to handle) and other high price options didn't appear to be well received by consumers, so I gambled on this cheapie.After pouring through the reviews it seems like this mouse is either a hit or a miss. Many of the one-star reviews complain about connection problems, lag, etc which means there might be some quality control issues. Thankfully I got one of the good ones because I haven't had a single problem yet.Most cheap mice feel cheap and have poorly designed wheels which make scrolling a chore. This mouse actually has a nice feel to it and the wheel feels very smooth and accurate. I haven't done any extensive testing but it has worked perfectly fine on the surfaces I do use it on, namely both my home and work desk without a mousepad. The shape contours nicely with my hand. If I didn't know the price of this then I would guess it to be a $50 mouse, easily. I haven't had a single issue with my mouse pointer zinging off screen, or anything like that (a common problem with cheap mice in my experience).The only (extremely nit-picky) thing I've noticed is if I don't handle the mouse for a few minutes and then I go back to using it there is sometimes a very slight half-second delay, but after this very short initial delay everything goes back to normal. I just chalk that up to the nature of bluetooth, thankfully the delay goes away immediately and after such I notice no lag or delays.For me this is a great every day mouse perfect for the office and the road. Although I don't notice any lag (except that tiny delay mentioned above) I would say it's probably not the best mouse for something where precision is absolutely paramount, like gaming - not because I notice a difference (I do light gaming with it), but because more hardcore gamers are probably more sensitive to absolute precision than I am.I read one critical review online from a reputable magazine that said this mouse doesn't work for Mac but that is not true. I use it in OS X and Windows just fine. I haven't yet tested it on my Linux box, so I can't confirm if it works or not there.Overall a great value!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SAM96D9WYH9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KY58FE#wasThisHelpful","R1SAM96D9WYH9V","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this keyboard and thought I had found something that would provide a great bang-for-the-buck, but unfortunately that's not the case. This keyboard simply has too many issues.There are a few good features. First, though it's really just plastic it does pull off the brushed aluminum look pretty well. The key action is surprisingly good though the official Apple keyboard (which I now use) is significantly better. Another cool feature is that this keyboard is super lightweight.Unfortunately there are just too many issues with this keyboard. The biggest annoyance is that it will suddenly lag while typing and it will also repeat keystrokes. I'll go to type ""hello"" only for it to type something like ""helloooooooooo"". For some reason this keyboard has a real hard time with the login screen in OS X. It's almost impossible for me to type my password because it will repeat keystrokes constantly. I'll try to hit delete a few times to attempt to correct the added keystrokes only for it to delete everything. When I'm past the login screen it will behave better, but the problem doesn't disappear entirely.Another major annoyance is that it tends to go to sleep too quickly and once it does it takes 10-20 seconds for it to pair with my computer again. if I'm doing any sort of work where I need to bounce back and forth with my computer and some sort of manual non-computer work (such as reading a technical book, writing things down by hand, etc) then it becomes cumbersome having to wait for the keyboard to pair every time I go back to my computer.Finally, I don't like how the esc key doesn't function like an esc key, it's actually the home key for iOS devices so in order to use it as esc you have to hold the function key first. As someone who uses esc constantly this is a bit of an annoyance (fellow vim users will understand!). I ended up hacking around this by using a program called Seil to remap my caps lock key to esc, but I don't like resorting to hacks like that. I wish there were some option for me to use esc normally.I have since purchased the official wireless Apple keyboard that this thing tries to imitate and it's MUCH, MUCH better. No lag, no repeated keystrokes, no constant pairing and very satisfying keyboard action. The  official keyboard might run you $50 more but it's more than worth it in my opinion, especially if you will be using it as your main keyboard.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R70UVP0Y7QMEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ONMDYE#wasThisHelpful","R70UVP0Y7QMEA","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a career developer but most of my work has been done in higher level languages like C#, Python, Delphi and a couple others. I did a bit of C programming in school but that was a long time ago and much of that knowledge has been lost. I've always had an attraction to C because I love its simplicity and power, but I never really took the time to understand it more deeply. I'm no stranger to concepts like pointers, function pointers, the stack, the heap, etc but much of my knowledge was really just on the surface - I knew enough to answer job interview questions, but I didn't know enough to really apply these concepts in C more intelligently.This book went a long way toward helping me really understand more advanced pointer concepts on a deeper level. I feel much more confident knowing when and where to use these concepts as well as how to identify potential memory leaks and more. I now understand how things operate on a more fundamental level. One thing I like is that this book didn't bog me down in too much academia, most of what I learned is on the more practical side of development, which is exactly what I was looking for. Another great feature is that this book is very short and concise. I really grow tired of pouring through thousand-page books all the time.If you have some development experience and really want to have a great foundation in C then I recommend  the following three books. All of these books are less than 300 pages each.- The C Programming Language (Kernighan, Ritchie)This is a classic that all C developers should work through. This book is short, but packed full of great content and challenging exercises. This book isn't fully up to date but that's okay, you will still gain a very strong core C knowledge and updating yourself to modern C concepts will be easy after working through this book. A must have.- Data Structures in C (Kalicharan)A fantastic book for learning common data structures on a more practical level. This is a great book for the every day programmer that needs brushing up on these concepts. Unlike most data structures/algorithms books, this isn't very math heavy and it's only 300 pages long so it won't take you too long to work through.- Understanding and Using C Pointers (Reese)This book. The C Programming Language will get you started with understanding pointers but this book will fill in the remaining gaps. Pointers are a sticking point for many developers, but with this book you'll learn that they really aren't very mysterious.If you work through these books (and do all or most of the exercises) then I guarantee you will become a proficient C developer, and you will certainly be a better developer overall, even if C isn't your daily language. You will learn to think more like an advanced programmer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7G331XT6UAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449344186#wasThisHelpful","R3H7G331XT6UAW","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I should have checked out the negative reviews before buying this thing.The top lid cover works great and snaps on nice and strong, however, the bottom cover seems to be maybe 0.5mm too shallow as it does not snap on cleanly and the cover hangs on for dear life. It eventually comes loose over time (I'm using a mid-2014 Retina MacBook Pro).This thing is a fingerprint magnet! Even with freshly cleaned hands this cover will suck up your natural skin oils and it's a pain to clean. It's not even worth cleaning because you'll just have more prints the next time you pick up your computer. Furthermore, the feet on this cover are junk.

"Some wheel/spoke/hub combos can be a bit of a pain when it comes to popping spokes, especially the spokes on the rear wheel non-drive side. This happens because non-drive side real wheel spokes are at a lower tension than their drive side counterparts on a properly dished wheel so in some instances spokes will work themselves loose over time then rattle around and eventually snap (especially near the spoke elbow).This stuff helps because it will prevent spokes from loosening, but the bond is weak enough to still allow spoke adjustments. I've dealt with a few pesky wheelsets before and this stuff definitely helps, it's just way overpriced for what it is. I only use this on the rear wheel non-drive side spoke threads so it should last quite a long time at least.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SURYB91JHWBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KZWC5M#wasThisHelpful","R3SURYB91JHWBV","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I never thought I'd be reviewing something like bicycle tube patches, but here I am.These things are completely worth the money! My favorite thing about them is that they are 16mm in diameter, which is surprisingly difficult to find in bicycle shops. Most patches are 20-25mm, and when you buy patch kits you always end up with those stupid square shaped patches that are almost never useful. 16mm is great because 95+% of all punctures can easily be covered by these yet they are nice and small so they work well with small diameter road bicycle tubes. I grew completely annoyed with having to use the larger patches which never fit right and always forced me to curl the patch around the tube, lessening my confidence in them. If your tube can't be patched by one of these (and in almost every case there will be no problems, even with MTB tubes) then just chuck the tube.Another great feature is that they bond extremely well. These are the lowest profile patches I've ever used and when applied properly they really feel like they become a part of the tube. Their low profile gives me confidence that they won't wear off due to friction with the inner lining of the tire.Having a box of 100 sure is nice!Here's my strategy for tube patching:If you've been patching tubes for a while then undoubtedly you've run into that situation where you go to use the vulcanizing cement that came with your patch kit but it's all dried up. Buying a large jar of the stuff doesn't seem to work well either because it becomes all gloppy (is that a word?) and chunky fairly quickly, so here's what you do:Have 10+ tubes handy. As you get punctures in them just mark the punctures with some sort of white marker and set them aside somewhere. Once you've gone through your 10+ tubes THEN it's time to do the patching. Just buy a cheap patch kit that has vulcanizing (not rubber) cement, I like the Park Tool VP-1 patch kits for this - the cement is good quality and you can get a kit for less than $4, plus they're widely available.Do all your patching in one sitting. Just grab a few cold ones and get to work. This means you'll be able to patch 10 tubes for about $0.60/ea. The price goes down the more tubes you do, just make sure you save up your tubes otherwise you'll be buying too many patch kits and it won't be much cheaper than just buying new tubes. You can easily patch 20 tubes with one small cement thingy.You can patch tubes to your heart's desire. I'll start chucking my tubes after they've been patched about 5-10 times each. Tubes when stored properly (like in a drawer or something) will last quite awhile, a couple years probably.Patching tips:- Never use rubber cement, use vulcanizing cement because it creates a real bond.- Scuff the area with the sandpaper that came with the patch kit you bought and then swab it with a little bit of rubbing alcohol to make sure the area is nice and clean (make sure it's dry before the next step, rubbing alcohol evaporates quickly, so you won't have to wait long).- Apply a thin sheen of cement over the hole, spread it out enough so that you have more than enough room to apply the patch without worrying about trying to patch over dry spots- MOST IMPORTANTLY: wait a few minutes after applying the cement before applying the patch! Give the stuff time to cure, if you apply the patch right away then the bond will be significantly weaker. Don't give into the temptation to apply early, wait at least 3 minutes.- Apply the patch and press down firmly for a minute or two. Push from the center of the patch out toward the edges to make sure you don't have any air bubbles.- Set the tubes aside somewhere and allow them to cure overnight. Voila! Good as new and way cheaper than buying tubes all the time (about 1/10th the cost!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ULTENWOX6TLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GSKPVO#wasThisHelpful","R2ULTENWOX6TLT","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very surprised to see current reviews on this machine! This thing was born over a half a decade ago!Well, I bought mine because I wanted a separate dev box outside of my 2011 Macbook Pro. I love my MBP, but I already have it setup with Bootcamp (Windows 7), I didn't want to load another OS on it (space is starting to get tight), plus I wanted something that would function as a sort of mini-server for my own personal projects. Finally, I wanted something I could lug around without worrying about breaking it, so I bought this thing.I really couldn't be happier! I decided to replace the existing HDD with a 50 gig SSD that I found at Micro Center (Denver)  for $39 on clearance. I also replaced the battery with an Anker battery which I bought here on Amazon for $40. I loaded her up with Ubuntu and this thing zips right along! ~$180 might seem a little pricey for a 6 year old laptop, but considering this total includes SSD and a brand new battery, I'm quite pleased. SSD is more energy efficient and Ubuntu is fairly lightweight (compared to Windows), so I get a little over 4 hours of battery life which is certainly acceptable for this machine.The display is surprisingly nice and has very little glare, so it's easier on my eyes when compared to the MBP. The trackpad is nice, but not as nice as the MBP trackpad (but what is?). I like all the clicking options - I can touch the trackpad or use the buttons above or below the trackpad. The red tracking button on the keyboard is great and was quite easy to get used to.This thing is a joy to hack around on! SSD is a must, so I recommend throwing a small SSD in it if you can. The 50 gig drive I have now is small, but it's perfect for my needs as I really only use this as a dev box (I use my MBP for things like games, media, etc). Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, the hinges do suck a bit.It's heavy and ugly, but that's how I like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KWRBJ3D6SG39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UDISEW#wasThisHelpful","R2KWRBJ3D6SG39","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not new to programming; in fact I've been doing it professionally for the past decade. Although I've played around in quite a few different languages, most of my work over the last 6 years has been in .NET (C# mainly). I have always had an interest in C because I love its simplicity. Also, it's a language which brings one closer to the machine, stripping away many of the abstractions that higher level languages provide. Higher level languages (such as Java, C#, Python, etc.) are massive and powerful with HUGE frameworks, but I'm attracted to simple things.This book is a feisty little devil! I had heard of this book before diving in (it is a classic), but its size and table of contents lead me to believe I would breeze right through it. Wrong! Picking up the syntax wasn't too difficult and I have a fairly good handle on more advanced concepts like pointers already, but this book is absolutely packed with exercises and many of them are quite challenging!Here's one:""Write a program to check a C program for syntax errors like unbalanced parenthesis, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments.""This is a chapter 1 exercise! Chapter 1 is just a tutorial introduction chapter and this is one 1 of 24 exercises in this chapter! No wonder it takes people years to work through this tiny book. I'm only about halfway through as I write this review.This book is the perfect blend of reference material, practical knowledge and challenging exercises. There is absolutely no fluff and not a single word is wasted. I grow tired of pouring through 1,000+ page tomes. The appendices are also very well structured and extremely helpful.Although I do virtually no C coding professionally, I can say for certain that this book has leveled up my skill-set. Working through these exercises has helped me with logical thinking and having a better understanding of coding closer to the machine has improved me as a developer overall. I'm one who believes that this book is great for all programmers, even if you never write a line of C after working through this book. I'm really loving the C language!Whether you are a beginner or experienced it's worth having this book. Though this will be quite tough for total beginners, I say it's still work picking up and supplementing with a more beginner-friendly book. Unfortunately I cannot recommend such a book at this time because this is the only C book I've worked through.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GO0Q2LPQ8UHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0131103628#wasThisHelpful","R2GO0Q2LPQ8UHS","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a software developer who writes code for both Windows and OS X. I'm also a hobbyist who loves to mix music, edit videos, and do things of that nature. I love both Windows and OS X (Windows for work and some fun, OS X for fun and some work). I own a 2011 Macbook Pro 13 inch base model with upgraded RAM (8 gigs, 1333 MHz DDR3). I use this thing like a full blown PC (dual-monitors, external devices, the whole nine). There has always been one glaring issue though - the standard 5400 RPM HDD is slow. I eventually ordered a refurbished Seagate Momentus XT Hybrid and though it was definitely zippier than the old HDD, it quickly conked out on me (a lesson to never buy refurbished HDDs!). I decided to treat myself and buy this SSD in the 256 GB variety.This thing is FAST. Having instant access to your favorite applications really enhances the overall user experience for any computer. I grew tired of waiting for big apps like Visual Studio to load, or waiting for broad searches to complete, or shutdowns and installs taking forever.I ran a few tests, just to give you an idea of the kind of performance I'm talking about. Unfortunately I never recorded these numbers pre-SSD, but I can tell you that before these actions took MUCH longer.Boot timeOS X - 9.8 secondsWindows 7 - 35.12 secondsOf course OS X has the advantage because it's the native OS and is tuned for this machine, but 35.12 seconds to boot into Windows via Boot Camp is FAST!Shut downOS X - 1.8 secondsWindows 7 - 2.5 secondsTired of watching spinning beach balls or hour glasses? SSD certainly solves that problem!I did a *.* search on my C drive in Windows and it took a meager 56 seconds. This is after installing a bunch of huge programs and services like Visual Studio 2012 Professional, SQL Server 2012, and more. That's crazy fast! Normally I would have to grab a snack and a newspaper.*.txt search (root C: drive, Windows) took 15.5 seconds.On the OS X side a ""png"" search on the entire root drive (using EasyFind so I could search all files) took a paltry 5.4 seconds. Launching iMovie takes about 1.5 seconds and Garageband loads in about 2.5 seconds.Going SSD completes the overall experience of interfacing with a computer. Once apps are loaded then it's up to your RAM, CPU and GPU, but standard HDDs have always been a bottleneck when it comes to reading/writing data to disk.I opted for the 840 Pro, but I think the standard 840, or better yet the 840 Evo will work just as well and save you a few bucks. All three have similar read speeds. The Pro and Evo handle IOPs faster (input/output operations per second). The standard 840 and Evo both use 3-bit MLC NAND memory, which means a shorter lifespan due to more writes (SSDs have a limited number of writes), but under normal use you will probably get at least a decade out of them. The Pro should theoretically last much longer, but a decade is sufficient for most people because eventually you'll likely upgrade. The standard 840 writes at about half-speed of the Pro and Evo, but for most consumers it should still be quite adequate. You'll be doing a lot more reading than writing, besides 250 MB/s writing is still quite zippy.Other perks include no noise and a longer battery life because SSDs draw significantly less power.SSD is the way to go. The difference between a standard sluggish 5400 RPM drive and SSD feels like the difference between dial-up and high speed internet. You'll refuse to go back!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SMOMG5NV3LG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NB8WRU#wasThisHelpful","R2SMOMG5NV3LG0","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Architecting enterprise level solutions is HARD. I find that I think much more about architecture than I do actual coding.The issue is that it's really hard to find great resources on proper architecture. Finding books on SOA, OOA/D, design patterns, and higher level architecture itself isn't hard, what's hard is putting all of these pieces together. One of the most difficult aspects is that architecture is very situational - modeling a framework is much different than modeling a music store app for instance. There's no one-size-fits-all solution, so it really boils down to experience. But it's hard to gain experience under expert guidance because, let's be honest, most architectures are junk and usually when I'm hired on for a new position the architecture is already set in stone, so at best I learn more about anti-patterns.Unfortunately this book falls into the same category as so many before it. There are lots of great nuggets of information, idioms, pearls of wisdom and thoughtful discussions, but again everything is very birds eye. This is a decent jumping-off point if you're very new to layered design, but don't expect much when it comes down to the real dirty work. It really just turned into a book that confirms much of what I already know, but it offers nothing when it comes to getting in the trenches.One other issue is that the book is very chatty, especially in certain sections (I can only assume it's because one of the authors is a bit more verbose than the other). There were occasions where I thought I was re-reading something for the third time by accident, but it just turned out that the author was re-writing it for the third time. For example, the whole section on DTOs is FAR more verbose and repetitive than it should be.I just wish there were a series of books that would take the reader on a complete journey from the beginning of a fairly complex enterprise solution to the end and explain the hows and whys. Explain the process of diagraming from business requirements, show examples, focus on raw code and real design obstacles, model a common business solution but not over-simplify it. Unfortunately I have yet to find this book. As I said, architecture is very dynamic and situational, but at least with a resource like this we could all start to see the forest through the trees and work through a real world example (a true real world example).This isn't a terrible book, it's just another ""program to an interface"", ""classes should be open for extension but closed for modification"", ""separate your concerns"", ""eat your peas and carrots"", etc book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQS12VIYCHAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FA0NX8#wasThisHelpful","R3FQS12VIYCHAF","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know I'm coming in late here, but I recently picked up a Paperwhite (PW). Originally I tried to save money by buying a Fintie case (great budget case, also closes magnetically and has auto on/off), but after handling a friend's PW with the Amazon case I just had to grab one myself - I was so impatient that I went right to Best Buy to pick one up that day.This thing feels great in my hands. It feels much more supple than the synthetic material my Fintie is made out of. What I really like is that the PW with the official case feels like a very cohesive unit, rather than the case feeling 'tacked on'. The magnetic cover keeps the unit closed just firmly enough to where I don't have to worry about it accidentally opening in the event of a drop, yet it's still very easy to open. It's nice that I don't have to mess with buttons, clasps or stretchy cords.One great feature is that the PW will automatically turn on/off when the case is open/closed. It's a simple concept, but it makes operating the Kindle a joy. It's amazing how much better this device feels when you remove a simple on/off button. I also love the form-factor. This case is molded to fit the PW perfectly. This is a huge step above my Kindle Keyboard (KK) with lighted leather case. I love my KK + case, but the clasps that keep it in place have worn over time and now the KK doesn't fit nearly as snug, so my it moves around inside the case a bit. The case for the KK is also significantly bulkier and more cumbersome to deal with. The PW's case is still pocketable (though it's a bit bulky for that) and it fits great in my backpack. I imagine it slips in a purse just as well.I love my Kindle Keyboard and I was reluctant to move over to the new Paperwhite concept, but I'm very happy that I did. Many of these new features my sound simple on paper, but they make all the difference when it comes to the eBook experience. I cannot recommend this case enough.$40 might seem a bit steep for a case, but you get what you pay for. If you can afford the extra cash then I say it's definitely worth it, if your budget is tight then the Fintie case is a fine alternative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7SISZTIQ0TJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007R5YFS4#wasThisHelpful","R7SISZTIQ0TJQ","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally owned the first iteration of the Kindle Keyboard (aka Kindle 3) and I enjoy using the device very much, but I'm a bicycle commuter who usually has my Kindle with me and often times I find myself wanting to read a few pages out in the pitch black night (I do a lot of night commuting). This meant using a book light or my lighted leather case, both choices not being optimal - a book light is another device to lose and maintain, the lighted leather case adds significant weight and bulk, especially if I just want to jam this thing in a jersey pocket.I was at Best Buy and on impulse I bought the Paperwhite version because it seems to be ideal for someone who wants a lightweight eReader with lighting built in. Overall I'm satisfied with the device, but it took some pains and improvements can be made. I'll break it down into a good old fashioned pro/con list:The Good: - The size is just right. My Kindle Keyboard is significantly longer and fits awkward in my pockets. I find it much more enjoyable carrying the Paperwhite around. - Always having a front-light available is very nice. I was tired of dragging around my bulky K3 + case. - The interface is significantly better. Now I can choose to view my books via cover view or list view. No more fumbling around with a clunky directional button. Also, I really dig the X-Ray feature (this allows you to view characters and places and get information about them - it doesn't work with all books) - I like how this device is more distilled. I never used the mp3 player nor the text-to-speech feature on my K3 and nobody I know who owns a Kindle ever had either, so I'm glad they just got rid of them. I'm sure this will affect some people, but those features always felt tacked on to me. I wish they would just do away with the experimental browser as well, it works in a pinch, but so does my smartphone. - I like the new reading progress feature which tells me how much time it estimates before I finish a chapter. I find it mostly accurate and it can be useful in the morning before I go to work. - This unit has better contrast and better resolution, but to be honest I don't notice the difference all that much when I have the light on the lowest setting (the contrast looks significantly better the brighter the light shines).The Bad: - The biggest issue is the lack of consistency. The first one I got had a dead pixel. The second one's text looked significantly more blurry. The third one looked significantly more pinkish/yellowish than the first two, finally I settled on the fourth one (plus I got sick of returning them), and even still it's not quite right. This one looks less pinkish/yellowish, but the far left LED shines significantly brighter than the other three, so there's an odd bright spot on the lower-left corner. It seems like no matter how many times you return them, there's another nuance and you sort of have to settle on one with the nuance that doesn't bother you so much. A friend of mine got lucky - he managed to get one with without the nuances. I just wish they were all like his, but instead he seems to be a minority. - Navigation is still sluggish. I understand that eInk is sluggish by nature, but I don't see any improvement speed-wise over my K3. Also, it can be a little unresponsive at times. - I wish they had kept the page turning buttons on the sides. Touching the screen isn't a huge deal, but I like having my hand completely out of the way and having the ability to just tap a button. Even if they only had one button on the right side which would turn to the next page (but still forcing to tap the screen to go back since that's a far less common action) then I think that would have been a good compromise. I accidentally turn pages more often now. - Only including the cord without the wall adapter is a little lame.Overall I'm happy with the device and I like the direction Amazon is taking it. With a few more tweaks this thing would be perfect, but they need more consistency when it comes to the build. The best version of this device (like the one my friend has) is closer to 4 stars, but most all the other Paperwhites I've seen come closer to 3.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X41UG1NM5JEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OZNZG0#wasThisHelpful","R2X41UG1NM5JEL","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love this simple little gadget. This allows you to keep your chain/rear derailleur engaged while the rear tire is removed. This is great for travel or great for those days when you need to do more detailed maintenance on your bike. I love this thing for when I need to deep-clean my bike. I can keep the RD engaged and the chain tight, making for easy cleaning on the frame, RD and chain, plus remove my rear wheel to clean and maintain that as well.I love the simplicity. This isn't an original concept but this one is extremely small and simple, which I love.

"I'm a bicycle commuter who commutes around 8000 miles per year, so I've certainly had my fair share of roadside problems, but this thing has always been there to save my bum.I have used virtually everything in this pack except for the spoke wrench (I prefer Park Tool's spoke wrench), and everything has worked good enough for typical roadside repair. I love that this pack has ample room. What Amazon doesn't show is that you can expand the size of the lower compartment. There are actually two zippers down there, if you open the outside zipper then you can expand it a bit, and zip it closed with an inside zipper. Very convenient. Fully expanded I can easily fit two two tubes (for 700X25 tires), as well as other small items.I'm surprised how useful this wedge pack is. Originally I just bought this because it was cheap and I needed something for roadside repair. I figured I would buy something more robust in the future, but I've found that this is all I need for my commuting.The only small issue is that the tools don't always stay in their respective locations in the top compartment (each tool has a cutout), but this isn't that big of a deal for me.Here is everything I keep in mine, and I easily have room to spare (I'm not even expanding the pack to fully utilize it's space). - All the tools which are included, except the spoke wrench since I prefer Park Tool's version, which I keep in the pack. - Leatherman Juice Multi-tool (VERY useful!) - Rear derailleur hanger - Spare screw for the cleat on my shoe (I lost one once, didn't want to get bit by that twice). - Mini white Sharpie (good for marking punctures in tires before patching) - 1X SRAM Powerlink - Spare tube - A few links of chain - Spare charged cell phone battery - 3X AAA batteries (spares for rear safety light) - Bus passes for dire emergencies - Spare cash for even more dire emergencies (if I need to call a cab, for example).This pack has not let me down.

"I'm a bicycle commuter and I've been using the same 40 liter REI Lookout pack for a long time (I bought it 7 or 8 years ago). I love the pack, but I'm just tired of it. It's way too big for commuting, the back panel doesn't breath at all causing my back to sweat a ton, and it has way too many pockets. Having lots of pockets is nice for separation, but I often found myself in a hurry and cramming things in random pockets, only to forget where I stuffed something, forcing me to dig through all the many nooks and crannies.After dealing with the Lookout pack for so long I decided to treat myself to something really nice (I've been saving up my dividends at REI!). I was looking for the absolute best of the best for my needs, at any cost. After auditioning dozens of packs, I settled on this and it's about as perfect as I can ask for.I could enumerate through every feature and really lengthen this review, but instead I'll save your sanity and talk about my favorite features.Here's what I love:The size is perfect for my needs. If you are looking for something that can pack a day's worth of gear, including all your EDC (every day carry) items, then this is perfect. I can pack a change of clothes, shoes, small toiletries (nail clippers, sunscreen, toothbrush, etc) as well as all my basic items like first aid kit, multi-tool, windbreaker, a book, small towel, snacks, etc with ease.The materials are top-notch. The zippers are smooth, the fabrics are strong, this whole thing is designed to last a very long time, which is why Osprey offers a lifetime guarantee.There are just enough pockets without being too little or too much. Too many pockets and I'm always looking for stuff, too few pockets and I'm always looking for stuff. This pack strikes the perfect balance. I can separate my gear (toiletries in one pocket, first aid in another, etc), and easily keep track of it all.The engineering is top shelf. The mesh panel keeps my back from sweating too much, compression straps are in the right places, the built-in rain fly is nice, and much more. Osprey really paid attention to detail.I really like how this pack comes with a high quality water bladder. The bladder stays relatively flat when full and it stays in place. The bite valve being magnetic and able to connect to the sternum strap is icing on the cake.I love the simplicity. My Lookout 40 pack has straps hanging everywhere, lashing points all over the place, loops, and pockets galore. This can be great in the right situation, but for commuting it's just too much. The Manta 28 simplifies all of this.This pack is very versatile. I use it primarily for bicycle commuting, but it could very easily work very well for a day hike, a mountain bike trip, or a romp around the city.I could go on and on.As for cons, I'm really struggling to think of any. If I'm being really nit-picky I might say that it would be nice if the sternum buckle had a built-in whistle for emergencies (fairly common on packs now-a-days) - ummm... maybe another mesh pocket or two? I don't know, it's really hard to fault this pack.The only caveat is that proper fit is absolutely essential, more-so than with most other packs because the rigid frame supports must conform to your body type. I imagine either the S/M or M/L with proper adjustment will fit most people, but I can see how this pack might not fit some (for example, if you have moderate to severe scoliosis then this pack might be very uncomfortable).Osprey is a very well respected company who stands behind their product. I imagine this pack will last me many years. One truth I've learned in life is that you (usually) get what you pay for. Quality bags cost money, this is one of those cases where the extra ~$30-40 is very much worth the price of admission.Check one out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P172XF892K97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AOICDL2#wasThisHelpful","R1P172XF892K97","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm on my 3rd Leatherman Tool.  Sadly, I can't seem to hold on to these things because people keep stealing them! Originally I had a Wave and I loved it, but it was stolen so I bought another. After a while I started using a Charge TTi because it's more-or-less an upgraded Wave (better feel, titanium handles, better blade steel, a few new features) and I gave my Wave to a buddy, but after a few years of use the Charge was stolen out of my car (this made me really sad!).Now I decided to go for a more minimalist approach, plus I want to save some money, so I went with a standard Skeletool. I do miss some of the tools that were on my old Wave/Charge, but in an effort to shave a few ounces and carry something a bit more comfortable in the pocket, I figured this would fit the bill, and it does, but there are a few nagging issues.First, the good:I absolutely love the bottle opener, which is a tool that I use a LOT. I really like how you don't need to really deploy it, you pull out your Leatherman and there it is. The carabiner clip usually does a good job of grabbing on to the loose cap when it pops off. The bottle opener is not only the best multi-tool bottle opener I've used, it bests many dedicated bottle openers!The slim design is really nice. I like keeping my multi-tool in my pocket and clipped in. I find myself double-checking to make sure it's still there, whereas with my Wave and Charge I could always feel it weighing my pocket down and eating up space.I really like how this tool is designed around the knife and not the pliers. With the blade deployed it feels very similar to a standard pocket knife. The handle ergonomics are designed this way, all the way down to finger grooves for comfort. The Wave and Charge are more comfortable for pliers, but the Skeletool is more comfortable for the knife and I like this a lot.I really dig how the bits lock into the bit driver. The Wave and Charge use friction force, which means they could potentially fall out (though I never had this problem).Having a spare bit wedged into the handle is also a great feature.This multi-tool only has a few functions (knife, pliers, wire cutters, bottle opener, carabiner, screwdriver), but everything deploys quickly. There's no unfolding and digging things out, which I really like.So far everything seems perfect, but a few issues bug me enough to knock this down a couple pegs.First, this is a multi-tool built around the knife and the (non-CX) knife just isn't that great. 420HC is easy to sharpen and very rust resistant, but it dulls very quickly compared to more modern steels. The biggest issue here is that this is a combo blade (half plain, half serrated), which turns sharpening into a bit of a chore. Combo blades can be useful, but not on a blade that is less than 3 inches long. They are meant to strike a balance, but here it's just sort of half-baked on both accounts, the fact that it's harder to sharpen because of this certainly doesn't sweeten the deal. Occasionally I find the serrations useful, for example when I need to chew through rope, but a nice sharp plain edge blade should handle most tasks just fine, especially with a toothier grind. Some people may prefer a combo blade, but I don't. 420HC isn't a terrible steel as long as it's very user-serviceable.Next, I like the spare bit holder in the handle, but it's not super secure, so it's very possible for the bit to fall out (it has happened to me). I would prefer  the slot to be on the other side so that when the tool is closed the slot is obstructed, lessening the chances of it falling out.I don't like how the flathead bit digs into my hand while I'm using the pliers. It's not an issue with the Phillips bit, but having to pull the bit out or deal with the sharp bit digging into my palm is not fantastic.Finally, there have been many accounts of the pliers suddenly snapping when any sort of twisting torque is applied. This hasn't happened to me personally (as I said, I don't use pliers a whole lot and when I do its light-duty), but you can't ignore this issue. The pliers aren't nearly as robust as those on the Charge and Wave.So, really what we have is a sweet and sexy bottle opener with a ton of potential.There is good news though-The Skeletool CX has a much better blade. It's a full plain edge 154CM blade. 154CM will hold an edge much better and the plain edge just makes more sense for a knife like this. I found a sweet deal on the non-CX version ($30), but now I'm wishing I would have just spent the extra cash for the CX. The CX still has all the other issues listed above, but those are relatively nit-picky when compared to the blade quality issue on the non-CX.The Skeletool is a neat gadget, but don't skimp and get the non-CX version. This thing is built around the blade, so having a good blade is a must. With a few fairly minor modifications this could be one of the most awesome multi-tools I've ever owned, as of now I still miss my Charge.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BUYU454MP9VK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XU9NXW#wasThisHelpful","R3BUYU454MP9VK","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When shopping for insulated water bottles the choice usually boils down to Polar or Camelbak. I have a couple of each, so I'll compare the two.CamelbakPros- The design of the nozzle is quite a bit better. Water shoots out in a more laminar stream. Nozzle auto-closes via flap, making it friendlier on the road. Also nozzle has a better locking mechanism.- Easy to squeeze.- Slightly more capacity (about an ounce).- Keeps water chilled for longer.Cons- Not dishwasher safe, with the exception of the lid (must be placed on the top rack).- Design of nozzle causes whistling while using. Not an issue on the road, but can be annoying if you are using your bottle in a quiet location. Nozzle also pops and whistles on its own while bottle is stationary.- Lid is leaky unless screwed on very tightly, and even then it can still leak a little. This is an issue with both of my Camelbaks.PolarPros- Dishwasher safe.- Has lanyard loop, which may be useful for some.- Lid screws on nice and solid, very easy to screw on.- Cheaper.Cons- Standard bottle nozzle is hard to go back to after using the Camelbak.- Stiff.So which to choose? Personally, for cycling I prefer the Camelbak, mainly because the nozzle is significantly better and the bottle is easier to squeeze.  I always carry water bottles with me and if I'm just relaxing then I prefer the Polar because it's less annoying to drink out of (as I mentioned, the Camelback whistles fairly loudly when sucking air back in and it even whistles and pops while not in use). Also, it's nice being able to just throw the Polar bottle in the dishwasher.I usually carry one of each, the Camelbak for the ride and the Polar for the destination.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGEALYMZORI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00437XN46#wasThisHelpful","R3FGEALYMZORI9","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are quickly becoming my go-to headphones. I'm a bit of an audio enthusiast, so much so that' I've developed tinnitus over the years (I play music, mix it, listen to it constantly). I've owned various flavors of Sennheiser and Grado in the $80-$250 range. Since developing tinnitus I can no longer use Grados because they make my tinnitus really flare up and Sennheisers just don't work for me.Money is tight, so I've been on the hunt for decent headphones in the $80-$100 range. Also, I've been looking for a pair that are easy to drive because I don't want to carry an amp around, plus I like the convenience of using my smartphone as a music player. After much auditioning I've come to these, and I love them!I need to play my music at about 1/4 volume max to keep the pain away and these are just so silky smooth at that level. As I turn them up they flatten out and some of the finer details start emerging more, which distracts my 'inner-mixologist' because flaws in the music/mix/source start to pop out more, which makes these sound more like monitors. This feature is great for mixing though, so being one who mixes this is a bit of a win/win, but some folks who prefer louder listening levels might find these too flat and fatiguing.They are  more comfortable than my Grados, and this is before I mod them with Beyer pads, which as I understand makes these far more comfortable still. Stock they aren't perfect though. They are nice and cushiony but the pleather gives me hot spots.Construction seems solid overall. The long curled cord is great for the studio, but awkward on the go.You should know that there is a hot debate as to whether these or the Sony MDR-V6s are better. Because audiophiles debate this so often that must mean they will sound essentially the same to most of us, and that's because they ARE essentially the same. The grounds are wired a bit differently  and the 7506s have a gold-plated plug while the V6s are nickel-plated, but this has no effect sonically, so essentially they are the same thing.Great headphones! Go audition them at a place like Guitar Center and if you like them then get the V6s. I wish I had known about the V6s before making my purchase, but I never ran across them while auditioning and fell in love with these instantly, so I bought them on the spot. Still a great value at $100 though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VV8W1V70YCEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AJIF4E#wasThisHelpful","R2VV8W1V70YCEH","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gaming on a smartphone can feel less like fun and more like a chore when you are restricted to swiping the screen. Characters are hard to control, you lose visibility on an already small screen and on some phones it can be easy to accidentally touch the wrong area of the screen causing it back out of the game. Recently it has become more popular to hook up Bluetooth (or USB) controllers to smartphones, but outside of emulators, support for controllers has been anemic. Power A is trying to change all of this and overall they are doing a good job - especially with the new Moga Pro controller.I own both Moga controllers, and honestly the original one pretty much stinks. It operates by using standard AAA batteries, it's awkward to hold which causing cramping in my hand, the analog sticks are terrible, also the buttons are stiff and quite loud. The new Moga Pro improves on the original design in pretty much every way. The Moga Pro is very similar to an XBOX 360 controller, including nice analog sticks which also function as buttons and a chargeable battery. The Pro is also bundled with a simple stand, which can be used to prop up your device (especially handy for tablets). The Moga controller is designed to work with Android devices, so unfortunately there is no iOS support.Although this controller is vastly superior to the original, it's not without a few flaws. First, even though this thing carries a hefty $50 price tag, it doesn't quite feel like a $50 controller, rather it feels very similar to something like an inexpensive Mad Catz XBOX 360 controller. The shoulder buttons feel a bit loose, the analog sticks are nice and springy, but it takes a bit of travel before they register, the analog buttons don't feel right - it just doesn't have that nice solid feel of a true Sixaxis or 360 controller, but overall it's not too bad. Many people find the rubberized grips to be comfortable, but I'm not one of them, I prefer a smoother and less rigid feel. I really wish the phone clip was adjustable. When I'm sitting in a chair it's fine, but when I'm laying down my phone sits too far forward, making it a little uncomfortable to hold for optimal viewing.You can use this controller with both Moga supported games (through their Pivot app) and emulators (though there is no official support for this). Search for ""Moga Universal Driver"" on the Play Store if you want to use the Moga with emulators. Pivot is pretty solid, but game selection is pretty sparse at the moment. Two free games were included, Pac-Man and N.O.V.A. 3. Pac-Man runs flawlessly, but N.O.V.A. 3 freezes, skips and hangs for me, which is odd considering I use a fairly powerful phone (Nexus 4). I did purchase GTA Vice City, which runs beautifully.This controller is a big improvement over the original, but the price is a bit high for what it is and there are still some improvements to be made. Using a controller like this completely changes how games feel on smartphones and tablets, essentially turning them into real portable gaming devices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPEEDA7E10A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTDBSXU#wasThisHelpful","RLPEEDA7E10A","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used various lubes in the past including Pedro's Chainj, Finish Line and others, but I keep coming back to ProLink.I like ProLink because it acts as a decent cleaner and a great lubricant. It's a lower viscosity oil, so you'll have to apply it a bit more often than the thicker stuff. I usually apply this stuff about every 150-ish miles.I believe that some people really overcomplicate the process of oiling a chain by using fancy chain cleaning tools, degreasers, extended soaks in oil and/or mineral spirit baths, etc. I'll share my personal technique below. I'm not claiming this is the best way to do it, but it's very easy and I get just as many miles out of my chains as I did back when I overcomplicated this process, if not more. I'm a full-blown cycle commuter who puts over 8,000+ miles on my bike annually, so I've gone through plenty of chains and have tried various techniques. Below is all I ever do anymore.First, there's no need to use degreaser unless your chain is rusty. I'm in the camp that believes degreasers do more harm than good by allowing subtle debris to work its way deeper into the chain. Also, I believe that degreaser can flush deeply penetrated lube out, which can be hard to re-apply. ProLink does a good enough job cleaning and your chain will still look fairly shiny.1. - Wipe chain vigorously with a dry rag (just hold the chain with a rag and pedal backwards).2. - Apply a drop of lube on each roller.3. - Wipe chain vigorously again.4. - Re-apply a drop of lube on each roller, try to get it between the roller and the plates for better penetration.5. - Let it sit for at least 30 minutes, while doing so pedal backwards on occasion to allow the lube to move around inside the chain.6. - Wipe your chain vigorously again. You don't want the outside of your chain to be wet with oil, this will only gum up your drive-train by turning your chain into a dirt magnet (also if you don't wipe it enough then you'll get those dirty marks on your leg).That's it. Keep it simple, the chain is a disposable part and I have noticed no added life by using degreasers and more involved cleaning/lubing techniques.I hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8Z91Z01G8DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UWFLMM#wasThisHelpful","R2V8Z91Z01G8DG","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a cyclist commuter and I have found merino wool to be the best material for commuting year-round. It's a fantastic wicking material, it helps prevent odor, it's breathable and it does a great job regulating body temperature, making it comfortable in pretty much any weather.I have three merino shirts in my arsenal. This one, and two 230 weight Minus33 long sleeve shirts (one being a turtleneck) and I have found this combination to be the best when it comes to covering pretty much all temperature ranges (being in Colorado, we do experience quite a temperature variance).The great thing about merino wool is that you can always put another layer on if you need a bit more warmth. It being a lightweight material makes it perfect for active folks.This shirt alone (with a shell) is perfect for 40+(F) weather. When the temperature drops to 30, I find just my Minus33 shirt works well. 15-20 degrees and I'll layer this Icebreaker shirt with one of my Minus33 shirts. When it hits around 5 degrees or so I find that both my Minus33 shirts layered together work perfect. This is as cold as I've ridden in, but I imagine if I needed to ride in the negatives, I could use all three shirts together and be just fine.Also, this shirt alone works really well on warm days. Merino is good at protecting you from harmful UV rays and it being so breathable means it will keep your temperature nice and regulated, even if it's hot out.I love the snug fit, but I do wish this shirt had just a little bit more length. I'm a bit long in the torso, so this may not be an issue for most folks, but I don't usually have issues with other brands. The sleeves are a great length. I did experience slight itching when this was new, but as I've worn it in the itching has gone away.I'm 6'1 with a 35 inch waist and large fits me very well (other than being a tad bit short, but as I mentioned, my torso is also a tad bit long).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4DTW8HX6XD3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F50IB0#wasThisHelpful","R4DTW8HX6XD3C","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a commuter, so I put my gear through a lot of miles (I ride about 6000-7000 miles per year). It seems like I go through about two safety lights annually. Usually they completely bug out (refuse to turn on/off, wont switch modes, etc) - I think the weather is the main culprit, as I ride rain, snow or shine.Overall I like this light. The mounting system sucks, which I'll get to in a second, but this thing has survived a few crashes and on two occasions it went into my spokes, completely ripping it off my bike, and yet this thing still ticks away.This light is BRIGHT! Visibility (or lack thereof) should not be a problem if you use this light. Batteries last a few weeks for me (on flashing mode), which is pretty average when compared to other lights I've used in the past.The only real issue I have is with the mounting system. I prefer mounting safety lights to my seat stay. The smaller circumference of my seat stay makes it very difficult to mount this thing and make it stick. It seems like no matter how tight I try to mount it, it still wobbles a bit too much. Finally I grabbed some pliers and cinched it down with all my might and it seems 'good enough', but it's still not ideal. Also, the mounting bracket forces the light into a fixed position, so it cannot be tilted. The light being mounted on my seat stay means that it angles up a bit, which makes me worry that I might be blinding people behind me.This has been the longest lasting light I've owned yet. I'm surprised it still works so well considering what it has been through!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J1AHAWS80ZWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RQJTDY#wasThisHelpful","R3J1AHAWS80ZWC","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking to learn just about all the LINQ syntax you'll ever likely need, then this is the book for you. Troy writes in a very clean and approachable style, making it easy to learn the material. I really like how the author doesn't beat around the bush, he gets straight to the point, which is why this book weighs in at a slim 330-ish pages. I really grow tired of reading 900+ page tomes all the time, so this was certainly a welcome break. As far as the raw material is concerned, this is a 5 star book, but there's one glaring flaw if you go the eBook route:The Kindle version is a complete mess. I know people find it annoying when reviewers drop the rating because of the format, but when you pay good money for a product, you expect professional results. The biggest issue is that all of the code samples look as if they were scanned images that were then OCR'd in. Many of the code samples look incredibly washed out, blurry and are almost impossible to read. Also, there are a few errors that occurred due to this scanning process, such as the wrong braces being displayed, some symbols are changed (what would be a less-than sign might show in the code sample as an equals sign for instance). It's really too bad. Do NOT buy this on Kindle, it is junk.If the publishers fix this problem I'll happily bring my review up to 5 stars, but until then it remains at 2.

"This is one of those books where I feel like I learned something new on just about every page, and I'm a fairly experienced developer.Don't be fooled by the table of contents, it's easy to assume that this book is for beginners. This is certainly not the case, you may feel educated in certain topics like type fundamentals, but Mr. Richter will likely prove that you only have surface-knowledge; at least this was the case for me. This book provides amazing depth, giving developers a bottom-up education, rather than the top-down approach (like most books). Combining bottom-up and top-down learning is quite powerful!If you are an intermediate or even an advanced developer, then this book will likely level up your skill set.Mr. Richter writes in a very clean and easy to read style. Buy this book and get ready to start cranking those mental cogs! I plan on re-reading many chapters to help solidify the concepts presented.Also worth noting is how excellent the Kindle format is.

"I recently upgraded the hard drive in my computer, so I decided to use the old one for smaller backups. I have another enclosure that I spent 3X as much money on, but I don't really like it. I prefer simplicity, my old one has an on/off switch and requires a power source (it's not powered through USB like this device). Also, my old one doesn't secure the HDD very well, if I shake it a little bit, the HDD moves around inside the unit.This unit is simplicity at its finest. No switches, you just plug the unit in and go. Also, it's nice that it's powered through USB and if you need a bit more juice you can just plug in the other USB cord (it's a Y connector, so you only need to deal with one cord). Also, this unit has padding which secures the HDD very well.I can't believe this thing only cost me $7.99 with free shipping! You can barely grab a bite to eat at a fast food joint for that price!

"I LOVE THIS THING!Seriously, I would shout this from the tallest mountain if I could. I commute nearly 100% by bicycle (year-round), plus I'm as bald as a cue ball, plus I live in Colorado.One of the biggest issues for me has always been covering my dome comfortably. I needed something that can soak up liters of sweat (so it doesn't get in my eyes), something that can keep me warm on even the most frigid Colorado winter days, something that can keep my ears warm, something that can handle some abuse, and as a bonus - something that looks stylish. Until now, finding the perfect combination of all these requirements has proven unsuccessful.I recently discovered the miracle of merino wool. It's an active fiber that beats the pants off of even the most expensive synthetic cycling gear I own, and it doesn't look ridiculous. My base layer is comprised of all merino wool from various brands, and I love all of it, but if I had to pick a single favorite piece it might be this. Being completely bald means my head is quite sensitive and this beanie is like a warm comfortable hug.I picked the gray heather dot version originally, but I love it so much that I went ahead and ordered the olive heather version so I can always have a backup. I sweat a lot so it's nice having two of these handy, one for the ride up and one for the ride back.I'm a picky person but I can't help but be very enthusiastic about this product.

"I'm a bicycle commuter and I commute year-round in the wonderful state of Colorado (which can get very cold in the winter!). I've been searching for a good material for commuting and I think I've hit the jackpot!I don't like the typical synthetic stuff you see many cyclists wear. It's not that great in cold weather and it needs to be washed constantly because it STINKS when you sweat in it. Also, most synthetic stuff geared for performance looks like synthetic stuff geared for performance - I would never go to the bar wearing a lycra jersey, for instance. Merino wool solves all of these problems!It's cool when it's warm, warm when it's cold and it's very comfortable once you break it in (I did experience very slight itching when I first used this product, but it went away after a couple wears and now it feels like a hug!). It amazes me how infrequently I have to wash this thing! I have gone on a half dozen sweaty rides before noticing any stink on this shirt, and it even passes the smell tests that my wife's super sensitive nose gives it. It air-dries amazingly fast, it's water repellent and it wicks sweat away much better than even the best synthetic stuff I own. Unlike other materials, you will still remain warm and cozy even it becomes wet. It also looks decent - it may not be the most fashionable thing in the world, but you can wear it in public and not feel like you look ridiculous.I would pair this shirt with a nice shell jacket, especially if you are a bicycle commuter. Merino wool is very breathable, which is awesome when it's warm out, but a bit chilly on the cooler days. With a shell and just this shirt I am comfortable well into the lower 30s(F).The only downside is that the sleeves run a tad short for me. I'm 6'1, so maybe I should have gone with the tall version. This is a personal fit issue (and only slight) and I don't see many people complaining about it in general, so it's probably just my body type, however, I don't normally run into this issue with other long sleeve shirts.Anyway, merino wool is amazing stuff!

"I've searched high and low for the best deal when it comes to lighting and ultimately it came down to this or the MagicShine MJ-872. I was really split on this for a long time - they are roughly equivalent, except the MagicShine has what looks like a nicer battery (has LED battery indicator, swipe it to turn on a light on the battery itself, which can be useful), and the TB-1600 comes with more schwag such as a little gear bag (which I'll probably never use), an extension cable and a diffuser lens. Also, the LuminkTrek comes with a 5 year warranty, which became my ultimate deciding factor.Upon opening the package the first thing I noticed is that this thing just oozes quality. The packaging is nice, the cords feel durable, the light head feels very solid, etc. I'm very picky when it comes to quality and I was pleasantly surprised to see how well built this thing is, especially for this price.This light is BRIGHT! My previous light was a Cygolite Pace 300, which was usable (though crappy on twisty trails) and the TB-1600 absolutely BLOWS the Pace 300 out of the water. Of course, it does claim to have an additional 1300 lumens so I did expect this. I don't have enough experience to determine if the TB-1600 is a true 1600 lumens, but I suspect that it's closer to 1000-1100, which is still quite good, besides, most companies probably stretch the truth a bit, so it's probably not any more of an exaggeration than any of the other claims out there.Most of the included goodies are nice. I do like how this comes with an extension cord. Constantly removing the battery pack from the bicycle for charging can be cumbersome, so having an extension cord included is nice, that way I can just keep the battery mounted on my bike while I charge it. The extension cord is also handy if you need a lot of length between the light and the battery (for example, if you want to keep the battery in your backpack, or if you want to mount the light on your helmet). The included 'orange peel' diffuser lens is a nice touch. The included charger does feel a little cheap-ish, but I haven't had any issues with it yet so I have no real complaints. I haven't used the helmet mount yet, but it does look like it will do the job just fine. I don't have any use for the included gear bag, but I suppose it's nice that they threw it in the package.This light is definitely geared more towards fill and less towards throw. This is either good or bad depending on what you need it for. I do wish it offered a bit more throw at the expense of some of the fill, but it's still a good light for general commuting and an even better light for mountain bike riding. I bought this 1600 because I do enjoy riding in the mountains, but if you are just a general commuter then I'd probably look at getting the TB-1000. You'll save yourself some cash and that light offers better throw.Here are the bugs:My biggest issue is the o-ring mount. I've never liked these. They don't allow you to swivel the light, they are prone to breaking, they aren't terribly secure and it's just another small part to lose. I'd MUCH prefer a dedicated mount on my handlebar.I'm not sure how much I trust the battery light indicator. Even when this unit is fully charged, the light will show blue when I have the brightness on medium (green means fully charged, which it will show on high and low). I contacted LuminkTrek about this issue and they said that this is normal and that that the battery indicator is more accurate when it goes from blue to red, but at that point it means I'm almost out of battery power! They did claim that MagicShine has the same issue, but I can't verify that and I would just rather the thing work correctly.The battery indicator will remain on if I have the light plugged into the battery, but the light off. LuminkTrek says this is normal, but they suggest disconnecting the cord when it's not in use. I wish the light didn't draw any power while off. I know MagicShine had this issue at one point but I do know it has been addressed, so there's one point for MagicShine.The straps that secure the battery pack to the frame feel a bit thin and weak. I haven't had any issue yet, but I do wish they were a little more robust.One other concern I have, which is not directly related to the product itself, is that LuminkTrek is a brand new company and there's just not a whole lot out there (during the time of this review). It seems that most people go with MagicShine because they are a reputable brand. With start-ups you just never know how long they might stick around, but hopefully we see LuminkTrek gain some speed and become more widely recognized. Their customer service is fast and friendly and I do see that they are quite active on various boards and such, but it's hard to tell if they are really gaining traction.Overall this is a fantastic light for the price. There are a few issues, but these can more-or-less be forgiven because you get such a great bang for the buck.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BCG0WZGHPFGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZFRGVU#wasThisHelpful","R3BCG0WZGHPFGH","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I became tired of wanting to pull my (non-existent) hair out of my head whenever it was time to adjust my cantilever brakes, so finally I took my bike to a bicycle shop so I could see what method they used for adjusting brakes (namely tightening). I saw the mechanic pull out Park Tool's version of this, and he had my brakes tightened and adjusted in less than a minute. I was floored!Cantilever brakes can be finicky. I would try to adjust them by using just regular old pliers and patience, but my patience was very rarely rewarded. It's a pain to pull the cable at just the right tension, hold the pliers with one hand, and screw the anchor bolt with the other, only to give it a test run and find out the brakes are way too squishy, usually so bad that barrel adjustments (typically used for fine tuning) wouldn't really help all that much. Typically this means a retry, so I would try to cinch it down a little tighter, only to go too tight and find that my pad is rubbing against my rim. Maybe I'm just mechanically inept, but sometimes I would spend upwards of a half an hour just to try and get the brakes just right, only to give up and settle for squishy brakes.I discovered that this tool is called a 'fourth hand tool' (or simply 'cable puller'). I didn't want to spend $45 at the shop for one of these, so after doing a little searching on Amazon I found this one for $13. WHAT A GODSEND!Sure, the name is stupid (IceToolz...?) but I bet it's every bit as functional as Park Tool's version. It may not be quite as rugged, but I bet this thing will still last for years. This isn't the type of tool you need to pull out every week, and it doesn't undergo a lot of stress when you do use it.It may seem a bit confusing to use at first, but once you figure it out you'll be amazed at how easy cable adjustments can be. When I used it the first time it almost seemed *too* easy. The beauty in this thing is that it allows you to set cable tension to where you like it, lock it in place at that tension, remove your hand from the tool (so you can make sure you still have clearance for the wheel, for instance) and then make micro adjustments to get the tension exactly where you need it.This tool is also great for setting the cable tension on your front derailleur. Setting a RD isn't too hard without one of these, but FDs tend to be a bit more of a pain.If adjusting your FD then just set your FD in the lowest gear (smallest chainring). Use this tool to pull the tension, squeeze until the FD begins to shift, then just back off a bit and anchor your cable. Voila! Setting the FD tension couldn't be easier!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RSPBTRA60AG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028N57KK#wasThisHelpful","R2RSPBTRA60AG2","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"REVIEW UPDATED ON 06/05/2012 (updates following initial review)REVIEW UPDATED ON 07/01/2012REVIEW UPDATED ON 08/07/2012 (first major issue)REVIEW UPDATED ON 08/28/2012 (first flat)Well, I figured I would go ahead and start an on-going review of these tires. During the time of this initial review I had only put a few dozen miles on these - but as some people say ""If you can go ten miles without a flat, then you can go thousands"", we'll see about that in the coming days.I'm going to keep the review portion quick because I still have to really get some use out of these for a fair review, so here's a quick review, which I'll follow up with mounting instructions. Future updates will be at the very bottom of this review.Weight: *Roll Resistance: ***Acceleration: ***Speed: ***Durability: ***** (so far)These are heavy, fairly low roll resistance (which is good), decent acceleration and speed but they are amazingly durable (at least they should be, only time will tell - but you can't ignore their reputation!). The Marathons are 5 star tires. The negative points can be forgiven because these are all about durability and longevity, which as a daily commuter are are most important.With my previous tires I started getting flats after 500 miles, and the flats became daily. Even though I don't have a whole lot of experience with the Marathons yet, I can just tell that they are FAR more durable. Broken glass is extremely common on my commute and I can almost hear these tires laugh as I roll through it.REVIEW EDITS06/05/2012:I put well over 150 miles on these tires over the last week, doing my best to hit all the different types of terrain I possibly could. There are a few things worth noting:First, as I mentioned these are heavy, which makes climbing hills significantly more challenging, I'd say by a good 15-20% over my previous tires. My legs have just started adapting to this, so it's not a huge problem, but hills do hurt a bit more.Also, I have tried to hit every possible type of terrain I possibly could. I've ridden over grass, gravel, pavement, dirt, etc. These aren't a fantastic all-terrain tire, but they will work on just about all surfaces if needed. They don't really have enough 'grab' to ride through loose dirt very well, but they handle packed gravel surfaces nicely. They have good cornering on pavement and they are doable on grass, though not ideal. They cut through little pools of water on pavement like a hot knife through butter.Finally, these things ARE durable as heck! I have purposely ridden over large glass 'fields' which would have easily punctured my previous tires, and these tires just roll right through it without any problems. On one commute I literally hit every piece of glass I possibly could (large and small) and I haven't had any issues.07/01/2012I just wanted to do a post-500 mile update. I'm well over 500 miles now without a single flat or issue. My legs have become accustomed to the additional weight. Wear on my front tire is very minimal, it still looks brand new. Wear on the rear tire is noticeable but very minimal considering I've put significant mileage on these. Previously I used Kenda Kwick Cross tires and by 500 miles my rear tire was near bald. I imagine these will last for many more miles!08/07/2012Well, now that I'm at the 1400-ish mark I've had my first major issue.I was commuting home when my back tire hit some piece of metal. I'm not sure what I hit, but I heard a loud *PING* as my tire kicked whatever it was into the frame, it bounced away and must have fallen into a storm drain as I couldn't find whatever it was. It sounded big though. Now there's a gash halfway between the center of the tire and the sidewall (I was turning at the time) and it runs lengthwise down the tire. It's about 1 1/4 inches long and I can clearly see the blue layer underneath (about 2 mm wide).I must have hit something big and sharp. Amazingly the tire didn't flat, the blue layer protected my inner tube. I didn't even realize I had damage in the tire until I did some routine maintenence the following day. Aside from this gash the tire itself looks like it's about 40-50% worn. The front still looks real good, perhaps 20-25% worn. I weigh 210 and often carry a 25lb backpack (plus I carry a wedge, safety light, headlight, 2 bottles) and at this weight it looks like I'd get about 3,000 miles out of the rear tire had I not hit whatever it was that caused this gash.Money is tight, so I'm going to still ride on the gashed tire for now (the underlying belt is in great condition and the blue layer has no visible damage). We'll see what happens!08/28/2012Just a quick update:Well, I got my first flat. I was 30 miles into a 60 mile out-and-back (of course) when my back tire became squishy. As it turns out, a thorn made its way into the gash I mentioned in the previous update. I guess when your tire is spinning at roughly 5,000 revolutions per hour something bad is bound to find its way where you don't want it. In this instance, the thorn managed to just barely dodge the blue belt and make it through to the tube (if you look at a cutaway image for this tire, the gash is right where the blue belt is at its thinnest).I can't fault the tire for this because I'm sure such gashes are quite rare and had I not had this gash then the tire would have simply laughed at the thorn and punted it away.On a positive note: dismounting/remounting wasn't anywhere near as painful as it was when the tire was brand new. It took me about 15 minutes to fix the flat, most of the time was searching for the hole, patching and testing. Remounting was only a tad harder than the average 700X32 tire.I'm going to install a boot in the tire where the puncture came through and hope for the best. I'll do my final update when I replace this tire, which will either be when I experience one more flat because of the gash, or wear the tire down entirely. I went right around 1900 miles before experiencing my first flat on these, not bad at all, especially given the circumstances. I put my full trust in these tires. The front tire is showing about 30% wear on the tread, the back tire is now around 60%Well, I guess that update wasn't so quick, my bad.TIRE MOUNTING INSTRUCTIONSIf you've read other reviews then you probably know that these can be a SERIOUS pain in the arse. I've read stories of people taking 6+ hours to mount these, or having to take them into a local bike shop only to have the mechanic give up, but it CAN be done by yourself with the right technique, and once you master it then you will not fear any roadside flats (like that's gonna happen anyways! *knock on wood*)So, I'll try to describe this the best I can but I highly suggest checking out a video on your favorite video site (sorry, have to be vague here - my reviews keep getting rejeceted). Do a search for ""How to fit a Marathon Plus tyre"", and check out the video made by SpaCycles. The nice gentleman in this video shows a great technique, however you may have to modify it a bit as I did because this man has a heroic grip and he makes it look a little too easy!Rule 1: Take your time!Rule 2: CONSTANTLY check the inner tube to make sure it's not going to pinch.There are two challenges when it comes to mounting these. The first is getting the second bead started and the second is getting the last little bit of the second bead over the rim.- First, inflate your tube slightly, just enough to give it some shape.- Now put the tube into the tire (I found it easier to put the tube in the tire prior to mounting, rather than putting the tube in after getting the initial bead on, your mileage may vary). Make sure you put the tire on in the right direction! The last thing you want to have to do is dismount and remount because of a simple oversight (I nearly did this!).- Work the initial bead on to the rim. This can be slightly challenging with this tire, but it's certainly manageable. Once the initial bead is on just do a quick check around the rim to make sure there is no pinching going on.- Here is the first real challenge - get the second bead started. Normally getting the second bead to start on a tire isn't too difficult but these Marathons are so stiff that it's a bit of a pain. If the tire were a clock I found that if I put my hands in the 2:00 and 10:00 positions and massage the tire into the rim I'm able to get the second bead to finally seat. Once you have the bead seated then use a zip tie, toe strap, or even a shoe string and wrap it around the rim/tire a cinch it down to hold the tire to the rim. Congrats, you're halfway there!- Now, starting from the cinched down area, work the second bead into the rim, keep working it in until the bead is seated on the opposite side of the cinched area from the previous step. Now cinch the tire to the rim like in the above step. You should now have half the tire seated and two straps cinching the tire to the rim opposite of each other.- Continue working the second bead in until you simply can't budge it anymore. I'll assume the remanining unseated bead is in the 12:00 position. Okay, to get the second bead to seat just a little more, start at the 6:00 position and squeeze/push the bead INTO the well of the rim (as displayed in the video). Squeeze it like a near-empty bottle of toothpaste, hand over hand, until you reach the unseated area. If you did this correctly then you should be able to seat just a tiny bit more of the bead into the rim. Keep doing this on alternating sides until you just cannot budge the bead anymore. If you have super grip strength you can probably finish seating the bead using this technique (as displayed in the video), but for us mere mortals move on to the next step:- Now you're going to need a lot of leverage to finish the job. This is a bit hard to explain, but essentially I sat on the ground and pretty much wedged the tire into my chest as if I were playing it like a harp. The unseated bead should be at the top of the rim. With the tire in ""harp position"" I was able to use my whole body for leverage. From this position you can use both hands, one to pull and one to push. So, go the the very edge of the unseated area, tuck the tire into your body, wrap your legs around it (I was even using my face for a little more leverage!) and now you should be able to seat the bead just a tiny bit more. Don't forget to use the 6:00 squeaze technique from the previous step, it helps. If you keep repeating this step then eventually you will hear a VERY satisfying pop as the tire finally seats correctly into the rim. Using a tire lever to push the in the bead can ease the job a little.- Remember: CONSTANTLY check to make sure the inner tube has clearance, the last thing you want to do is finally seat the tire, only to have a pinch-flat.- Once everything is kosher then run along the rim, squeazing the tire in, just to make sure there are no pinches. If you see a pinch then gently use a tire lever to stuff the tube under the tire (and pray you didn't pinch-flat it!).I was able to get the first tire on in about 40 minutes and the second tire in about 25. I'm confident that I can mount these in 25 minutes or less now, but dismounting them - well, that might be different. Hopefully I don't have to do that for a long, long time!If any of this is unclear then please leave a comment, I will be happy to try and clear things up.I will update this review periodically (I promise!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMME32X8GMXVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015UOUJQ#wasThisHelpful","RMME32X8GMXVM","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There seems to be two camps when it comes to knives like Wusthof, or other popular western brands (and even some higher end commercial Japanese brands such as Shun, Global and Mac) - on one side you have the average household user who will probably absolutely love them. Chances are that any of these brands will be far, far better than what they currently use, so upgrading to Wusthof, Henckels, Mac, etc will be like a night and day difference. However, if you dig through the bowels of the internet you will find that many people despise these popular brands and will recommend top of the line, though typically lesser known (to us plebs) brands such as Kikuichi, Konosuke, or something like Fujiwara as a starter. Many of these knife geeks will only use super hardened Japanese knives. Many of these high end Japanese knives have an even better bang-for-the-buck value than the popular brands, but they still come at a price.How sharp do you really need your knife? I can certainly appreciate the extremely sharp top end Japanese knives, but there are some considerations if you decide to go this route. Many of these knives have a very high Rockwell hardness rating of 60+ (some well over 60), and this is fantastic because that means it can hold a very sharp edge at 14 (or less) degrees, however, this also means that these knives are very brittle. A single drop can easily destroy one of these knives completely, often breaking it into two. If you are going to cut through any sort of bone material then you will definitely need a cleaver of some sort because this can also destroy one of these high end knives. Another thing to consider is sharpening. If you want to go with the super high end Japanese knives then it's best to learn how to sharpen yourself (using water stones or something similar) because even most professional sharpeners will not sharpen these correctly. Learning how to sharpen properly, while cool, is a very challenging feat. Of course there are pros that can sharpen these knives properly, but chances are they don't live near you so you'll have to package and ship it out somewhere, wait a couple weeks, etc.Here's why I love my Wusthof Classic knives, especially this 8 inch chef's knife:This thing is a BEAST! I can cleave, drop, bang, rattle, etc and it just begs for more. I'm a bit of an ape in the kitchen at times and I'd hate to be constantly worried about dropping my precious knife. I also really like the straight-forward symmetrical edge. This knife is very easy to sharpen, so even the 'professional' sharpeners out there will likely sharpen it correctly (or very close to). Also, I like the Rockwell hardness of 58 on this knife because it seems to be a great balance between edge retention and strength. Furthermore, I prefer the weighty feel of this knife over the super light feel of the higher end Japanese knives. Even though you can make a super high end Japanese knife sharper than this Wusthof, this knife can still be sharp as heck, and will slice through just about anything with ease. You want paper thin tomato slices? No problem. Like I said, how sharp do you REALLY need your knife?I love almost everything about this knife (length, balance, grip, etc) but there is one minor issue - out of the box this knife is not at its full potential. Don't get me wrong, it's SHARP, but to get maximum potential I would take it to a reputable pro sharpener. Mine is sharpened professionally to around 17 degrees bilateral, which made a significant difference.Do as much research as you need and try to experience as many knives as possible before making your purchase. There are MANY people who absolutely love their 'scary sharp' top-top end exotic Japanese knives and while I can certainly appreciate them, like I said earlier, I'm a bit of an ape so I need something that can take a beating. This is ultimately why I chose this Wusthof Classic (I also own a few Henckels 4-Star knives, which I also enjoy, but I now prefer Wusthof).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I06MN46FNUMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005MEH1#wasThisHelpful","R3I06MN46FNUMT","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are reading this review then chances are that you are either already a PKD fan, or you may be considering purchasing this as a gift for someone who is. If you are new to PKD then I highly recommend starting with the PHILIP K DICK READER, which is an excellent collection of short stories, from there I'd probably read one of his novels such as THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE or DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? (avoid books like VALIS for now, though it is a fantastic book, it certainly helps to be well-familiar with Dick's style before diving into this one). If you find that you just can't get enough PKD, then it might be a good idea to go ahead and purchase this whole collection.I'm not going to review each of the books in this collection because you probably already know if you are going to enjoy this or not, instead I'm going to review the collection as a whole, as well as the quality of the materials.This is the first collection of novels I own which are published by the Library of America and I couldn't be more overjoyed with the quality of the materials. These books are designed to last for generations, so the binding, cover and acid free paper all all very high quality. I've seen reviews around the net that complain, saying the protective covers are `ugly', but I disagree. They are minimalist, and I like that. These volumes use bible style paper, which give each book a nice, tight form-factor. The pages are very thin and crisp. The largest volume, which is roughly 1150 pages total, is about the same thickness as a typical 650 page mass-market paperback. These volumes ooze quality.The Library of America absolutely nailed it when it came to selecting some of his greatest works. Of course people will have different opinions on what the 'best 13' might include, however it's hard to nitpick these choices.One other plus is the price/value of this collection. During the time I wrote this review the whole collection cost $70.00. This means that the cost of each novel is right around $5.40! That's a fantastic value, especially considering the quality of the materials used. Even if you bought each of these books used it would still be hard to beat this price.There does seem to be one glaring oversight as Robert Moore pointed out in his excellent review (November 17th, 2009). Philip K. Dick is undoubtedly a fantastic novelist, but some argue that he's an even better short-story writer. If this collection included a handful of his best short-stories it would have been absolutely perfect. The LOA could have easily included a few of these as bonus material in each volume, or better yet, an entire volume dedicated to a collection of short-stories.It's nice to see PKD get this sort of recognition. Even most die-hard PKD fans will admit that he has flaws in his writing, however these flaws are part of his charm and those who are patient will see his sheer brilliance. PKD is not for everybody. I can't help but smirk when I hear people complain about his inclusion in the Library of America. Yes, he may be the black sheep on the LOA, but he's here to stay. Not too many authors can open your mind in the way PKD can.Aside from the nitpick I mentioned earlier about this collection not including short-stories, this product is an easy five stars. My wife gave this to me for Christmas, and I will cherish this for the rest of my life. PKD is one of those authors that I can re-read many times over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N0J5LK11X4O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598530496#wasThisHelpful","R3N0J5LK11X4O1","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The reviews for Stephenson's latest creation seem to be divided. Either people love the fast-paced action, blazing guns, explosions, etc etc, or they find the book a bit intellectually dull (Stephenson is rarely a 'simple' read). The latter is especially apparent given that his previous novel (Anathem) is a complete mind-(bleep), and FAR more intellectually stimulating.By Stephenson's standards, this is a bit of a 'beachy' read, but it's still full of his engaging prose, witty dialog, fun characters, etc. Sure, the good-guys vs bad-guys story is nothing new, and you will probably guess the outcome far before its fruition, but it's still a blast. This is not life-altering stuff, but I did find myself missing the comfy world Stephenson put me in immediately after finishing the book.If you love Stephenson, but perhaps you are also a closet-Crichton-fan (I know you're out there!) then you will probably enjoy this book. However, if your main attraction to Stephenson is his big, super complex, (typically) innovative mind-bending worlds - well, this one may be a miss for you.Reamde is a very solid 3.5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ILDXXDVLEQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061977969#wasThisHelpful","R35ILDXXDVLEQP","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first got into Iain M. Banks because I heard he wrote big sprawling space opera novels, a genre I've been interested in but my thirst was never fully quenched. I kept reading Banks hoping for the 'big one' but never found it until I read EXCESSION.No doubt all of his books are great. Even an 'average' Banks book is far above most other sci-fi books, but I always wanted something huge, something that spans across many different planets, something with a large cast of characters, many different twisting plot points, etc. PLAYER OF GAMES was my first Banks novel and it was great, but it was very focused on a single character. CONSIDER PHLEBAS was good but it felt like a few massive digressions hovering over a fairly thin plot. MATTER felt like it was going to be the big one, but at around the halfway point it sort of flattened out and never really gained traction. USE OF WEAPONS is another great story, but it didn't really have that sprawling epic feel that I was looking for. Finally I read EXCESSION -- This is what I have been waiting for!EXCESSION has a HUGE sprawling plot with loads of characters, lots of great ideas, intrigue, it has a little bit of everything (romance, war, mystery, conspiracy, etc).EXCESSION is fairly complex, so read it carefully. There has to be at least 40 active characters (if you include the minds) and at least a half a dozen plot threads -- there's a lot to keep track of, which can be bit a bit mentally taxing. Sometimes Banks will abandon a thread for what seems to be a hundred pages before going back to it, meanwhile he will spin three or four new ones.This is five-star Banks material. EXCESSION really clicked with me, but I would read a few other Banks novels before dipping into this one (I'd recommend PLAYER OF GAMES then USE OF WEAPONS then CONSIDER PHLEBAS then EXCESSION, personally).EXCESSION is an amazing read which earned a spot on my 'to re-read' shelf. Definitely check it out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YTM8SN7M8F99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553575376#wasThisHelpful","R1YTM8SN7M8F99","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Usually when I hear people say ""The book is not like the movie"" I will typically find more similarities between the two rather than differences. This is certainly not the case with 'I am Legend' - the two really couldn't be much more different.Many people seem to be coming to this book after watching the movie. I actually enjoyed the movie (somewhat). I found it to be a good evening out with the Miss's back when it was on the silver screen -- average Hollywood blockbuster fare. Knowing that books are typically better than their movie counterparts I was excited to dig into the book version. Overall I do like the book better, but it's not without its flaws.It is interesting to see Will Smith on the cover with a backdrop of New York City behind him - in the book Robert Neville looks nothing like Will and it takes place in Los Angeles.About the book -I'm not into vampires AT ALL. I have almost zero interest in stories involving them, so I was a little dismayed when I found that they populate this novel. Thankfully at least they aren't the super charismatic, overly powerful, teenie-bopper vampires that populate many of the stories today. In 'I am Legend' they are more animalistic, though the anti-garlic, anti-cross, anti-sunlight clichÃ©s are present. I was able to get over this.Robert Neville is seemingly the only known human to have escaped an outbreak which is turning both the dead and the living into vampires. Robert is just a typical human being who is suffering loneliness in an abhorred world. Robert spends many hours a day ensuring that he lives to see the next day. He is constantly setting up strings of garlic, building stakes, fixing boarded up windows, etc. Eventually he becomes fed up and he tries to solve the mysteries of vampirism. Why can't they go out in the sun? Why is garlic such a good deterrent?Really, this story is more about a man's loneliness, the vampires and such are more in the background. I found that this book touched on the loneliness aspect far better than the movie.Here are some of the things I enjoyed about the book -I found the writing to be quite excellent. Also, finally I now understand what ""I am Legend"" really means - something the movie never really addresses. I like how in the book Robert is just a typical man with his own problems, such as alcoholism. Even though it did feel a little abrupt, I did like how the story ended, it's one of those books you reflect on for awhile after setting it down.But, there are some flaws -In some instances the scenes didn't really flow together very well. For instance, there is a whole scene involving Robert's interaction with a dog. Matheson doesn't really weave this scene in very well; the story just sort of comes to a halt as we read about this interaction for a number of pages. This element would of had more impact had it weaved with the underlying story a bit better, to me it felt really tacked-on. I found the science in this book way far-fetched and there are a few too many pages dedicated to this. Also, Matheson's idea of living and dead vampires felt as though it was an idea that really never fleshed out fully. It does come into play at the end, but it could have been done a bit better.Overall, 'I am Legend' is greater than the sum of its parts. Despite its flaws I enjoyed it quite a bit.Also worth noting, only half of this book is dedicated to the story 'I am Legend', the other half of the book contains various other non-related short stories that range from about 3 to 20 pages. Some of these are decent, but I had no idea this was a book of short stories, so I was a little disappointed to find that out, especially since it is not mentioned anywhere on the cover. I have read comments for other reviews that say ""Well, you're getting more than you paid for!"" but I don't quite see it that way - to me it would be like expecting a full-length movie, only for the movie to wrap up 40 minutes in, and the remaining 40 minutes to be below average to average short 'Tales from the Crypt' clips.In the end, I give 'I am Legend' a solid 4, and I collectively give the remaining stories about a 3. Overall this book is around a 3.5, but rounded to 4.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OAGRJXUGFIHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765318741#wasThisHelpful","R3OAGRJXUGFIHV","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please bear with me, as I hop on my soap-box for a minute. I promise I'll review the book -WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?*ahem*, I'll try that again...First, let me get the AA piece out of the way. My name is Steve, and I am a Democrat. (""Hi, Steve!"")Does that really even matter? No. It shouldn't. I'm not a Communist, Marxist, (yadda-yadda), but I have Democratic morals. So what, right? Here's my point - yes it IS possible to be a Democrat and still love this book. Why? Well because this is just FICTION. Yes, the future in this novel is bleak and scary, yes the political leanings in this book are certainly towards the right, yes some of the characters are racist - WHO CARES! This is still a very well-written book with tons of intrigue, mystery, the whole nine.Dan took what was in his mind a possible scenario, and wrote a fictional novel out of it set in a dystopian America. Authors have been doing this for years. This does NOT mean that Dan is a crazy, racist, wing-nut blah-blah-blah. If that were the case then the author of the dystopian work 'A Clockwork Orange', Anthony Burgess, is truly one sick puppy - but people still love his work! (myself being one of these people)Here's the problem: more and more people are polarized because of political differences. It's almost like religion to some people, so when someone comes up with an opposing viewpoint people get extremely 'butt-hurt' (sorry, not a tactful term, but accurate). So, if you are the type to get 'butt-hurt' over differing political ideals then this book is not for you - go back to reading dystopian works about anarchist children, serial rapists, etc. However, if you are able to set political differences aside and just enjoy a nice work of dystopian fiction, regardless if you're a Democrat or Republican, or in between, then by all means check this book out!I have been slammed defending this book by other reviewers in the comments of other reviews, essentially being called a DINO (Democrat In Name Only) just because I enjoyed this book. Odd that reviewers like these will then say 'Well, it's not the politics that bother me, it's that the writing is poor!'. Bull. If you weren't so 'butt-hurt' by the political aspects then why would the favorable opinion of mine, a Democrat, even matter to you! Gah! So frustrating! IT'S FICTION PEOPLE! People say 'Well, just read the first line in the book - that is proof that this book was written poorly!' Hey, how about reading the rest of the lines, eh? This book was NOT written poorly. I'm sure I could dig through any of Dan's books and find lines that aren't written perfectly. Who cares. By the way, the first sentence is ""'You're probably wondering why I asked you to come here today, Mr. Bottom' said Hiroshi Nakamura."" (Ooh - the horror, right?)(Okay, breathe easy)Alright, I'm off the soap box now. So here's the review, as promised:Former Denver detective Nick Bottom lives in a very broken America. We have gone bankrupt. America has become ripe for the pickins for the Caliphate, Japanese, Mexicans, etc. Suicide bombings are common, stadiums are used to house prisoners, we are down to 44 states, our military has long been stretched WAY too thin. Essentially, we are helpless. Instead of trying to do something productive about it, most citizens have become addicted to a cheap drug called Flashback.Flashback is an interesting drug. This drug allows you to live vicariously through your former-self. You inhale the drug, focus on a memory and the drug will take you there, allowing you to relive that moment. You are still aware of your current-self while on the drug.Former detective Nick Bottom has lost his wife. Like many others, he is addicted to Flashback, which caused him to lose his job. Money is so hard to come by, which is doubly-painful when you have an addiction. A very powerful Japanese dignitary named Nakamura offers Nick enough money to feed his Flashback addiction for life if Nick can solve the murder of Nakamura's son. This seems like an impossible task, the case has been cold for six years and Nick wasn't able to solve it before - nobody can seem to solve it. Nick is also trying to solve the murder of his wife.Making matters worse, Nick's teenage son Val wants nothing to do with him. He lives with his Grandfather (Nick's father in-law) in California and he belongs to a flashgang. Flashgangs commit heinous crimes, and because they are twisted people they flash back to said crimes (rape, murder, etc).That's about as much as I'm going to give away as far as plot.This book, like the drug, is ADDICTING! For a Simmons novel this one moves incredibly brisk. Little-by-little the mystery moves closer to resolution as we see the story unfold from a couple different angles. One thread follows Nick, another his son Val. Simmons leaves little cliffhangers throughout making it downright impossible to put down at times.Okay, there is a little bit of beef, so I couldn't give it the full five stars...Many of the characters aren't fleshed out as well as those found in Simmons' other work. I wouldn't go as far as to say they are 'cardboard' or whatever, but this is no Carrion Comfort, which has AMAZING characters. Also, though the end is good, it doesn't quite meet the potential it had given how intriguing the rest of the story is. There are also a couple areas that seem a little too 'convenient', but it is rare, and I don't want to go into those for risk of spoiling important plot elements. The problem is that Simmons puts himself on his own scale - it's hard to give this one a five when he has such jaw-dropping books under his belt like Hyperion and Carrion Comfort. That being said, this book is still good. Very good.So, if you can get over the political aspects of this book then certainly check it out. I actually found the political aspects interesting, even if my own political beliefs don't align with those in this book. Besides, over 90% of this book surrounds the murder mystery, this isn't ""pages and pages of extreme right-wing rhetoric"" like many reviewers are trying to lead you to believe. I question if many of the reviewers here have actually read this book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TRPU6MBB67MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316006963#wasThisHelpful","R3TRPU6MBB67MH","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many reviews out for this product, and all of them are true. Yes, you can travel back and forth in time, through different dimensions, etc. Yes, downloads through this cable happen so fast that your desired music is already playing before you even think about it, it can solve global warming -- yadda, yadda, yadda.However, I recently learned that I can actually use this cable on organic material! It even works on humans!My friends thought it might be funny to play a practical joke on me. A girlfriend-of-a-friend left a message on my answering machine on April 1st saying what a good time she had with me, how I need to 'work late' more, etc - knowing that my wife is the one who checks the messages. My wife didn't realize it was just a joke.That night, after a raging fight, my wife went to bed alone, locking me out of the room. When I knew she was asleep I waved the cable in front of the door to unlock it. Just for an experiment I placed my index finger and thumb on the arrows and placed the cable against my wife's forehead. To my disbelief a port materialized on her forehead, allowing me to plug in my Denon cable! I was able to read and manipulate her thoughts and memories! When she woke up she had absolutely no recollection of the fight, the joke, or even the time I took her mother out to dinner and made her mother pay for it!Now I use this cable all the time. I have plugged it into my boss's head for financial gain, I have used it on my friends for various reasons (lie detection, practical jokes, etc). Hah, I even used it on my brother in-law John and convinced him that he was from the future and something was going to come THROUGH the cable and overrun planet Earth! This was back in June of 08. I told him to write a review about it here on Amazon.One great feature is that you can seed future suggestions. This feature allows me to alter thoughts, beliefs, etc and then remove the cable, allow the the port to recede (which is awesome to watch!), and in the near-future the suggestion will fire. This is especially useful if you want your target to, say, forget there was ever a cable plugged into their forehead! Right now I'm new to the timed-suggestion feature, so I haven't done much with it, but I am planning on seeding more complex timed-suggestions in the future -- and ultimately I plan on taking over the world. In fact, by December 2012 you will forget this review even exited!Anyways, why the 3 stars? Well, Denon doesn't mention any of these extra features, so I just can't give this a 5. As a dedicated link cable it's marginal at best. The features I mentioned earlier as just bonuses. Denon mentions none of these awesome features (time-shifting, mind-manipulation, predictive music downloading, etc) -- so... it's like using an old PC as a doorstop. Sure, it functions GREAT as a doorstop, probably even better than a doorstop, but you don't see ""Works great as a doorstop!"" on the box.So, to summarize - great mind-manipulator, marginal (at best) dedicated link cable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHRTEPDUEODC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I1X6PM#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHRTEPDUEODC","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a new fan!A Clockwork Orange had been sitting on my to-read shelf for quite some time before I decided to pick it up. I kept avoiding it, and I'll tell ya why - it was because when I bought the book I had read a couple pages and immediately I hated it because I couldn't understand what the F Burgess was trying to say! But I couldn't give up on a classic so easily, so I bought it anyways, and on the to-read shelf it went -- and stayed.I should have read this a lot sooner! Yes, the nadsat slang drove me nuts at first. I thought Burgess was trying to drive me into a world of madness! Perhaps to bring me to a similar level as our narrator, Alex. But, by the end of the book I was driving my wife nuts, I'm sure she still would love to tolchock me on the gulliver.You've probably read a plot synopsis already(or maybe have seen the movie), so I'll leave that alone here and just lay out some opinions -I still haven't seen the movie, but I do know one thing for sure - I too would have chosen the same version as Kubrick. The 21st chapter isn't terrible, but in my opinion the difference between the 20th and 21st chapter is so radical that I felt the book lost some of it's impact. I understand what Burgess was going for in the 21st chapter, but when I read the book, I read the 20th chapter as a finality, just so I could think on it for bit, then I read the 21st chapter a day later and I'm in the camp that believes ending it on 20 gives one a bit more to ponder on. Plus, it's chilling as hell, and I liked that.The only other minor issue is that much of this story does feel a little contrived, especially towards the end. I understand why, it's because this book is quite short and for maximum impact certain events really need to take place, but some events just felt a little too 'convenient'. But, this is minor, really.Overall, even given the few issues the full version of this book has, it is still one of the greatest books I've ever read. There are very few books that are on my 'to re-read' shelf, but this is certainly one of them. A Clockwork Orange is short, fierce, and incredibly deep. I never felt like I would be able to connect with a character like Alex, but I did. However, on future re-readings - I'm gonna stop at 20, I was chilled to the bone when I read the last sentence!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20HXRDVHB8SU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393928098#wasThisHelpful","R20HXRDVHB8SU7","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carrion Comfort is another jaw-dropping horror novel penned by one of my favorite authors, Dan Simmons. This one is quite long, and though there were a few minor instances of tedium, on the whole this was an amazing read.This is a book about revenge. Saul Laski, a former Jewish prisoner in a death-camp during the Holocaust was 'used' (his mind taken over) by a man who he calls 'the Oberst'. Saul will stop at nothing to hunt this man down. But, this is the tip of the ice-berg -In the world there exists a small population of 'mind-vampires' who have the ability to slip into people's minds and control their actions. This is just a game to them. Mere mortals are just toys - they are even used as chess pieces in a couple instances. Once a year the mind-vampires visit an island, which is privately owned by a highly respected billionaire, so they can play a game where they use people to kill each other, the one with the most points wins.I'm not going to dig any further into the plot, but I will say it is quite deep and fairly complex - though easy to follow. Carrion Comfort has a fairly large cast of characters, most of which are fleshed out nicely. Multiple threads spawn, which are all in third-person except for one which is told in the first-person view of a mind-vampire named Melanie Fuller (who will go down as one of my all-time favorite villains!). I really dug how Simmons weaved the plots together, allowing the reader to experience certain events from various perspectives.Overall this is a great read, which I give a 4.5/5 (rounded to 5 for Amazon). Check it out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ388U80QOVO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312567073#wasThisHelpful","RZ388U80QOVO4","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: I updated this review on 7/27/2011. Update will follow my original review below.I love Stephenson's writing, I really do - but I consitently find significant gripes that really affect my overall impression of his work. As far as writing is concerned I place him somewhere between Iain M. Banks and Dan Simmons - Like Banks, he knows how to formulate a sentence very creatively, but unlike Simmons, who is also an amazing writer, he tends to pile on too much, sometimes making it a bit of a chore to wade through the pages.There are many reviews out there that outline the plot, so I'll keep it really brief.Anathem takes place on an Earth-like planet called Arbre. Behind walls there are concents where the highly intellectual 'avout' live, separated from the more consumerist society on the outside. Because of their intellect, they are banned from using anything highly technological. The avout belong to different 'maths'. Depending on which Math one belongs to, every so many years they are allowed into the outside world for a short period of time, and the outside (saecular) world is allowed in. Depending on the math, the switch can take place every year, decade, century or millennium.Anathem is told in the first person perspective of Erasmas, a young avout who belongs to a ""Tenner"" (a math who is sworn to not emerge from the walls for a decade). It is discovered by the avout that something alien is orbiting Arbre.I have heard many reviews say that this book is incredibly difficult for the first hundred pages or so. I actually found the first hundred pages to be a tolerable read if you take it slow, and use the timeline and glossary judiciously (though your brain will hurt!). Anathem contains a ficticious vocabulary of probably a hundred or so words, which seems daunting at first, but once everything comes into focus it's actually quite easy to follow.Anathem moves at a snails pace, which, for me, wasn't actually a bad thing. I enjoyed reading about the architecture, the relationships, etc. The story really starts moving probably 200 pages in, and for the next 300-400 pages I thought it was excellent and highly engrossing, though you really do have to pay close attention. The problem is that Stephenson packs on so much weight that it really begins to slog towards the last 200 pages. Everything sort of comes to a halt. I actually had to put this book down because it became so painfully slow. After reading about a dozen books I decided to finish (it was a bit of a chore to re-orient myself). In the end it does pick up a bit, but the payoff felt a bit small considering how much I had to wrap my head around to get to this point.This is another Stephenson book that has awesome scenery, some amazing ideas, intriguing discussion, but it just started to become too much.**** REVIEW UPDATE 07/27/2011 ****I have to update this review. I was in my car waiting for a storm to pass so I could hike, when I had wished I brought a book with me (how could I forget my book!?). I remembered that I had Anathem in the backseat, so I decided to read from the beginning again, only intending to pass time and not get sucked back in.I got sucked back in.Anathem on a second reading is proving to be absolutely amazing. On my first pass through, I enjoyed the book for the most part, but the constant need to flip back-and-forth between the story and the glossary does cause one to miss an awful lot, and perhaps a few headaches trying to keep everything in your brain. However, once I started to read it for a second time and I already understood the language of Anathem, as well as a better idea of how the characters are developed -- I am finding the story to be absolutely engrossing, if not downright impossible to put down (I missed my hike, though the storm had long passed).I have a feeling that this is one of those books that provide you with new experiences with each pass, as you really begin to understand this crazy world a little more each time.I'm not changing my review yet (3 stars as of the time I write this), but I very well may in the future. I am re-reading Anathem on the side so it might take awhile to get through it again, but multiple efforts might prove to be quite fruitful, and I very well could up the score a star (or two!).This could be a real work of genius, or I maybe I've been fooled twice (well, maybe not 'fooled', I didn't hate it the first time through). Anyways, I have a feeling it could be the former.We'll see.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H92IC3Y4PRYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061694940#wasThisHelpful","R3H92IC3Y4PRYN","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second book on learning body language, the other one being 'What Every BODY is Saying' by Joe Navarro. By combining and using techniques from these two books, I've already made huge strides in becoming a better presenter. Joe's book is really good for reading people (finding tells, or finding clues of deception, etc), but does give insight to useful gestures that can communicate confidence. 'Winning Body Language' is more focused on being a better communicator in general, especially in the work place.I'm one of those people who always feels awkward when I need to speak in front of a group of people (large or small), but  at work I'm always finding myself needing to give presentations, demos, or conduct small meetings. I've had a number of bad experiences in the past that help fuel my paranoia - 'deer in the headlights' moments, jokes intended to loosen people up that flop, the feeling of high stress, ugh, what a nightmare. I would actually lose sleep the night before, knowing I had to do some sort of presentation. I started feeling helpless, so on a whim I purchased this book just to hopefully get a usefull nugget of information or two - and I got all that and more.I just recently had to do a presentation on the software that I'm currently developing. At this point I had read Joe's book and I had read only the first few chapters of 'Winning Body Language'. Even this was enough to help me give a successful presentation. I used a few subtle hand gestures, and I also tried to keep my hands in the 'TruthPlane' as much as possible (something you'll learn in 'Winning Body Language'). Immediately I felt much more confident and I was getting great reactions by the observers. Usually when I speak, the air is really drab and sometimes quite thick, but this time it was very lively and productive. For once I actually felt great giving a presentation! Even after the presentation the Director of IT (my boss's boss) came up to me and said ""That was a great presentation! You were really on fire this time!"".This stuff works! Out of the two books I've read thus far, I recommend 'Winning Body Language' if you are trying to become more successful with talking to groups of people. If you want to learn how to read people really well, then check out Navarro's book 'What Every BODY is Saying'. I could have just gotten away with 'Winning Body Language' for my intents, but being able to read people certainly pairs well with learning how to communicate effectively.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31JCLL1KXNQ8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071700579#wasThisHelpful","R31JCLL1KXNQ8Q","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are browsing around, looking for the best Silverlight 4 book then I suggest you stop now, because you've just found it. I've read through a bunch of technical books in the past and Silverlight 4 In Action is not only the best Silverlight resource I've read to date, it's one of the best technical books I've read to date.Mr. Brown covers Silverlight 4 in great depth. You learn about 2D/3D rendering, WCF RIA services, MVVM, working with devices like webcams, printing, the list really goes on and on.Pete has really hit the sweet-spot between readability and technical detail. This book is never boring. Pete's writing is funny, fresh and has a good rhythm. I really like how Pete can explain things so clearly. Pete doesn't dumb this book down for those of us who still need to learn about classes, variables and such - this book is for the experienced developer that wants to learn Silverlight 4. The very first project, a hello world application, hits Twitter via WebClient object and uses somewhat advanced features like binding a ListBox to a complex object, and even uses a lambda expression; certainly the coolest 'hello world' app I've run across thus far!But there's more -Not only is this a great book in all respects, you also get access to free downloads for .pdf, .mobi and .epub formats! I was excited when I heard this book came with the .pdf version, but I had no idea it came with such a feature-full .mobi version! Awesome! I own a Kindle so I am using the .mobi format and it's absolutely perfect. The .mobi format includes an active table of contents, chapter markers, text-to-speech - pretty much all the bells and whistles. Also, the formatting is perfect. I carry my Kindle everywhere, so I like to keep the hard copy at my work and dig through the .mobi version on my Kindle when I'm away. I really wish more books would do this.I rarely give such high praise to books, but this book deserves all of it. This sets the bar. Pete Brown is an excellent author, and the bonus .mobi download is just plain awesome.

"I'm a bit of a Scotch lover, so in an effort to learn more about the spirit I decided to download this book. I don't know why I didn't preview it first, but I certainly should have.There are so many issues with this book that it's a challenge to find any sort of redeeming value.First, this book is SHORT - I've browsed web pages on Scotch that contain more information than this. For a $4.00 download, I'd expect it to have at least a little substance, but not here. I blazed through this 'book' in about 10 minutes. On the smaller font setting, this book clocks in at 21.5 Kindle pages (reg Kindle, not DX). I bet this would be about 15 pages or so in a standard paperback format.Second, this book is absolutely riddled with grammatical errors, and run-on sentences. There are issues like 'ask strength' instead of 'cask strength', or things like 'three to 5' instead of '3 to 5' or 'three to five'. There are no topic sentences, all of the paragraphs feel really smashed together. He also does things like mix up 'whisky' and 'whiskey' in the same paragraph. Both spellings are acceptable, but there is no consistency here. He will also do things like capitalize 'Scotch' in some instances and not in others. Everything is just a mess. The whole structure of this book is an absolute disaster. He often meanders into completely unrelated topics. There is absolutely no cohesion. He uses semicolons improperly, gah! There is just so much wrong here.Finally, the author has no voice here. He uses tired clichÃ©s, and I get no sense of rhythm. This book is written like a terrible first draft English paper from a high school student.I know I'm being harsh here, but I urge check out a preview of this book. I'm sure you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.In case you don't want to waste your time on a preview, I'll give you just a few examples of what you can expect with this book (all of these examples are exactly as they appear in the book) -""Many people get confused and the difference between single malt and blended scotch.""""If you have the time and are seeking the sheer enjoyment of this spirit you should find your own bar that is Doc certified to sell the select brands of fine scotch single malts; as an establishment such as this is worth its weight in gold.""""Good malt is not an appropriate mate for a mixing party and does not really take kindly to a soda. It tastes much better with simple bottled water. The best paring with great malt would be of the mineral water variety bottled water is tolerated by malt without hesitation.""Or laughable paragraphs like - (padded, mixing 'to' with 'too', terrible structure, just plain laughable)""Why is it that scotch always seem to be left alone in the bar scene? It is understandable that most people find scotch to harsh to drink while dancing the night away but could it not be introduced in some mild cocktails? Generally it is assumed that the sweeter drinks tend to give you the staying power on the dance floor as it is usually loaded with sugar.""This whole book is dreck, don't spend any cash on it. A quick Google search will yield you far better results than reading through this. I learned absolutely nothing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DX8GKKQX5IOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LB5626#wasThisHelpful","R2DX8GKKQX5IOW","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: This review was updated on 08/10/2011. The update will follow my original review.First I'm going to compare/contrast the various Weber grills, then for the new Weber user I'll explain why the Weber Kettle grill is such a fantastic choice. I have used and abused my Weber One-Touch Silver for over six years now, and though the Performer has quite a few advantages over the other models, is it really worth the extra cash? I say yes, and here's why -I've used just about every variation of the Weber kettle grills over the years, and I currently own a One-Touch Silver. The following features are the advantages over the Silver.- Hinged Cooking GrateOne of the first upgrades I bought for my Silver was a hinged grate, it's nice that this one (as well as the Gold) comes with it; I have found this instrumental for indirect cooking.- Ash PanAlso like the Gold, the Performer comes with a much higher quality ash pan. The Silvers ash catcher has been problematic in the past (it's fidgety, cheap and doesn't function well in high winds).The features above apply to the Gold, which is roughly half the cost as the Performer. Here are the advantages over the Gold, justifying the extra cost -- Table SurfaceThis is a huge advantage. Having plates, condiments, spices, etc nearby as well as being able to do some prep right next to my grill has been awesome. I've used separate tables in the past with my Silver, but having a dedicated table is far more convenient.- Storage BinThe storage bin is designed to hold a couple bags of charcoal, but I actually find it more useful for storing everything other than coal. I have a place for charcoal in the garage and I actually find this more useful for storing things like wood chunks, grill mitts, the grill cover (when not in use) trash bags, paper towels, and things of thatnature.- Gas IgnitionI wasn't sure how much I would actually use this when I bought the grill, because chimney starters are easy to use, but there are a couple distinct advantages with gas ignition -First, it's easier to light the coals more evenly. With a chimney starter, by the time the coals near the top are ready - the ones near the bottom have burned for some time, which means the coals will not be lit as evenly when it's time to cook. With gas ignition it's easier to obtain a more even heat across the coals. Also, the coals are ready a bit faster with gas ignition.Second, it's far easier to re-light previously used coals. With a chimney starter this is a pain because you have to collect the previously used coals, which can be messy. With gas ignition all you have to do is rake the coals towards the center and press a button.- Wheels and Locking CastersIn my neighborhood we like to do cook-offs during the summer and everybody brings their grills out in the front, so we can easily talk trash with each other :). Moving my Silver around is far more cumbersome than moving the Performer around. I always had problems with the legs sliding out of the slots, and it's just more of a pain because you have to drag it around on two wheels. The Performer is MUCH easier to move around.- Swing Away Lid HolderIt's much easier to move the lid to the side rather than using a hook under the lid. The lid can also act as a bit of a wind-guard in this position. The downside is that the lid does get in the way a little bit, but overall I prefer this method.- ThermometerHaving a lid-mounted thermometer is great! I was a little disappointed because when I purchased the Performer I thought I was going to get the version with the removable thermometer (takes temps at the lid, remove it and it doubles as a meat thermometer). Unfortunately my version's thermometer is in a fixed position, but it's still great to have.- Better Overall ConstructionOne thing I don't like about the Silver and Gold Kettles is the cheap construction feel, especially the legs. The legs are extremely light-weight hollow aluminum, and though I haven't had any issues yet, they feel like they could buckle if, say, my dog ran into my grill. Also, while moving my Silver I've had problems with the legs sliding out of the slots. The Performer feels FAR sturdier. Nothing feels cheap here. Some reviewers think the table top is a bit cheap, but I disagree, it's a very thick and sturdy plastic that feels like it could last forever without weathering.Other perks include the built-in tool holder, which is better than the add-on you can purchase for the lower-end models (doesn't fall off, doesn't look cheap-ish, etc), the storage under the table and the better-designed vent tab on the top vent (has plastic heat shield making it cooler to the touch).Overall I'm extremely pleased with this grill. The only tiny issue I can really think of, which another reviewer mentioned, is the leg slots on the bottom of the grill. It looks like they just used a standard Silver or Gold kettle and welded on a few parts to fit the Performer specs. It's really not a big deal at all, but it does 'cheapen' the grill a little bit. Also, the price is a bit steep. Overall the price does seem worth it (though for the same price you can buy two Golds), but I think at this price they should have included the grill cover as a bonus, ah well.Why Weber?There are many grill choices out there today, both gas and charcoal, but I will always use a Weber Kettle. Why? Well, charcoal certainly does have a distinct flavor that many prefer, and really, cooking with charcoal isn't much more cumbersome than cooking with gas. I have used many different grills in the past and I've found that, for charcoal, the Weber Kettle is the most versatile, most predictable charcoal grill available. Weber uses high quality components that last for years, and the performance is unmatched. The dual-vent system allows you to do anything from smoke at low 200s to sear at high 500s with ease. Also, the one-touch feature makes cleaning up a simple process.I highly recommend using a chimney starter with the sub-Performer kettle grills. Chimney starters make lighting charcoal a snap, you just load the starter full of charcoal and either light newspaper, oil-brushed paper towel, or any other starter (such as a paraffin starter) underneath. This allows you to very easily light non-pre-soaked coals, which saves money, time and gives you a better flavor by avoiding lighter fluid or pre-soaked off-flavors.Webers are extremely consistent - typically higher end Weber Kettles just offer more convenience, so even a lower end Silver Kettle can cook just as good as a higher end Performer, you really just pay for convenience rather than performance. I have used my lower-end Silver for years and it can easily keep up with the much more expensive Performer. So, which Weber Kettle is right for you? Here are the various Kettle's I've used in the past and my thoughts on them -- Weber Silver 18.5 InchThis is a great starter grill. For the low price of $70 you can own one of the best charcoal grills around! The biggest downside in my opinion is the cheap ash-pan and the non-hinged cooking grate. I really don't like the Silver's ash pan, I have accidentally dumped mine one too many times. Also, with the 18.5 inch you will have to spend money to  upgrade to a higher quality hinged grate, which is a godsend for indirect grillers. If you want to get into a Weber Kettle at a great price and you have a smaller family then I'd recommend checking this one out. Indirect cooking on the 18.5 grills is not as good as the 22.5 inch variety.- Weber Silver 22.5 InchThis is my previous every-day grill and also the one I'd recommend last. Like the 18.5 inch Kettle you get the cruddy ash-catcher, but you also get the non-hinged grate and this Kettle costs $90.00 new. I would recommend upgrading to Gold for an extra $60.- Weber 22.5 Inch GoldThis is the sweet-spot for Weber Kettles. Here you get an excellent ash-pan and a much higher quality hinged cooking grate. This is the grill I would recommend to most people.- Weber 22.5 Inch PerformerThis is the fully-loaded Weber Kettle. You get all of the conveniences of the Gold, but you also get a table surface, electric ignition, charcoal bin, lid-thermometer and other goodies that make grilling with charcoal more of a convenience. This is the big-daddy Kettle, but it comes at a high cost - about twice as much as a 22.5 inch Gold!Really, you can cook just as well on all Weber Kettles (except indirect-cooking is more convenient on the 22.5 inch variety). You are really spending extra money on convenience, so pick a Kettle grill that fits your budget. In my opinion the 22.5 inch One-Touch Gold is the best bang for the buck, but the Performer makes charcoal grilling much more convenient. Pick one that fits your budget, but make sure you pick a Weber! There's nothing else that really compares.The Performer offers great features that really make charcoal grilling a convenience. The price is a bit steep, but if you have the extra scratch and the added features appeal to you then you really can't go wrong with this grill. I only have a couple minor qualm. For these reasons I give the Perfomer a 4.5/5, rounded up to 5 for Amazon.*** REVIEW UPDATE ***I'm not sure if people are still reading this review or not, but I just wanted to update it with the following tips -I've had the chance to use this grill for around five months now and I have completely fallen in love with the gas ignition. Mainly because it makes it so darn easy to conserve charcoal. I can literally make 2 to 3 20lb bags last nearly all summer (typically grilling for two people), and I grill just about daily.I constantly see people waste charcoal. Either they will put WAY too much in for what they are grilling, or they will throw all of the ashed over charcoal out, or they will leave the vents open (or the top off) when they are done, burning up the remaining coals. DON'T DO THIS! I have grilled up to FOUR times on a single heap of charcoal (without replacing any coals) and this grill makes it a breeze! Here are some tips for you guys who might need them -- You don't need a ton of charcoal if you are just grilling a few burgers, chicken breasts, dogs, etc. I can grill a burger with probably less than ten coals, I typically use just enough to surround the food on the grate. There are times when you just need a lot of coal, for instance if you are searing steaks, but for day to day use - you just don't need all that much.- REUSE your charcoal! This can be a pain with a chimney starter, but it's very easy with gas ignition. Just shake off the dust, pile them up and press a button. I typically light my used-up coals and if I need more I'll throw just enough fresh briquettes on top for what I need. I never ever throw away coal.- This works well for smaller families, here's what I do...Store a small pile of fresh charcoal (20-30 briquettes perhaps) inside the grill off to one side. Pile it up the wall of the grill. Light just enough used coal as you need and if you need more simply transfer a few fresh briquettes over to the lit side (using tongs). Just make sure you have the coals far enough to the side so they don't catch with the lit coals. Doing this makes it very easy to transfer coals when you need them, plus since there is less reflective heat coming from the bottom of the grill (the coals act as a bit of a heat-buffer), you will have a better 'cool zone'. I love this technique because I don't have to dig into my charcoal bag when I just need a few more coals, I just move them over!- Shut down your grill ASAP. Close all vents and put your lid back on the second you are done cooking. I typically begin shutdown a few minutes before my food is even finished because it takes a little time for the grill to cool down. With a single heap of charcoal, if I am being real conservative (and just grilling simple fare) I can get up to four uses before I need to start replacing coals. This is a HUGE money saver. And like I said, just throw a few fresh coals on from your side-pile as you need them, you don't need fresh coals for every grill session.- If you will be using gas ignition, then shut down the gas as soon as the bottom layer of your coals is lit and let the lit coals finish the job of lighting the others. This really only takes a few minutes. I get MANY uses (25 or more, I'll count next time and update) out of a single mini propane tank (like the ones you use for camping).Well, this review is certainly taking up a lot of space now! I hope you found these tips helpful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18WPZGEOX37DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002M1PQZE#wasThisHelpful","R18WPZGEOX37DA","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Matter is my fourth venture in the Culture series and though overall I found I liked it more than not, it still has significant issues, which I'm starting to notice in many of the Culture books. I'll touch on that in a second, but first a little plot summary-Ferbin, heir to the throne for the Sarl on the 8th level of the Shellworld Sursamen witnesses the untimely death of his Father, the King Hausk-- Untimely because the murderer is the King's best friend tyl Loesp. Ferbin is rightfully the next in line, but in fear he flees to find his Sister Djan Seriy, whom is now an agent for Culture's Special Circumstances (the guys that handle the 'dirty work'). Besides, Ferbin isn't exactly King material, and he knows this. He is suspected to be dead, so the next in line would be his brother Oramen, however, his brother is slightly underage so tyl Loesp takes the reins. Meanwhile the Oct, whom are the mentors of the Sarl have something up their sleeve. Quickly the plot splits into multiple POVs and we see the story unfold from multiple angles.Like with any Banks book, there's a lot to like here. I really dig the Shellworld idea. Shellworlds are manufactured worlds which are spherical like most other worlds, except there are multiple layers, like an onion. Each level contains different species, different landscapes, etc. At the core of the world is where the WorldGod is believed to live. Of course, Banks prose is intoxicating as always and I really liked the blend of high fantasy, sci-fi and even a bit of 'steampunk'. There are Lots of goodies.Unfortunately, like many of his other books, the plodding, err-- plotting could use some work. Banks spends a MASSIVE amount of time setting everything up and it begins to feel a little contrived, as if he's just moving pieces around for the final showdown. Also, here we have another climax that falls flat in my opinion. Tension starts growing between various parties and right when it's at its height an event happens that, well, it resolves the tension I suppose but not in a very neat way. Then, Banks quickly moves on to the end, which is very imaginative, but it still feel tacked on. I wish the tension I spoke of earlier was resolved in a more satisfying manner, especially after so much build-up. Ah well.I did like much of the book and I felt the important characters were fleshed out pretty well. When I was about 300 pages into this I thought Matter was going to be 5 star material for sure, but it sort of fizzles and then whimpers near the end (at the very end it picks back up a little bit). I'm giving Matter a pessimistic 3.5 (rounding to 4 seems a bit too generous for this one). It's worth a read, but the climax might irk you a little bit.Also, I should mention that despite there being at least 80 different characters and a bunch of different species I found this one to be quite readable. When I initially picked this book up and saw the huge character list and the massive glossary in the back I felt a little intimidated to start digging in, but after a hundred pages or so it really becomes quite easy to follow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R382DGP15H5953/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316005371#wasThisHelpful","R382DGP15H5953","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brave New World Revisited is a non-fictional essay by the same author as the fictional negative-Utopian novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley.This book was written almost 30 years after Huxley's landmark title Brave New World. Here Huxley compares the ideas in Brave New World with what was then modern day (1959). Huxley discusses brainwashing, propaganda, over-population, hypnopaedia (sleep-learning) and other subjects that were the driving force behind his original work. What's scary is how much truth is really behind this work and it's even more relevant now than it was in 1959!This is a very short book that reads almost like an extended after-word for the original Brave New World. Though for me it wasn't as moving as the original work, I still found it very eye-opening. If you haven't read the original work then you can still read this just fine, but still, read the original if you haven't done so!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27V96ZUFTXJ4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060898526#wasThisHelpful","R27V96ZUFTXJ4H","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Consider Phlebas is a tough one to review. On one hand I love Banks' voice, his big ideas and up until the end this book moves at a good clip. On the other hand I found the plotting to be random and a bit contrived. I'll weigh the pros and cons in a second -There is a war of galactic scale going on between the mega-utopian Culture and the super-religious Idiran. A sentient mechanical device called a Mind has taken refuge on a planet called Schar's World after an Idiran/Culture conflict. Horza, a mercenary who can change his physical appearance (a Changer) is employed by the Idiran to retrieve the Mind before the Culture snag it back for themselves. This isn't so easy, soon Horza finds himself unlucky as he goes from one screwed up situation to the next.There's a lot to like here. The scope of the war is massive, I found Horza to be mostly likeable (though not quite as developed as he could have been). Iain does a great job painting the scenes. I love some of the ideas he implemented, even if some of them aren't his own.On the flip-side I have substantial gripes. First, this novel is little more than a few massive digressions surrounded by the thin underlying plot. The crazy adventures Horza finds himself on have almost nothing to do with the underlying story. The version of this book I have is 468 pages long and I bet only 130 pages are dedicated to the underlying plot. Unfortunately it turns out that the few pages that are dedicated to the plot just aren't all that good.I found the ending to be quite lacking. I'm not going to spoil it here, but Banks attempts to pull off an emotional ending and really it just falls flat. Banks will use contrived plot devices to attempt a whiz-bang ending (a convenient pregnancy to try and pull at emotions later on, for instance) but really it just doesn't work here, there's just not enough going as far as character development, or emotional investment to pull an ending like this off and make it memorable. Unfortunately when we finally get to the real meat at the end of this novel is when the book slogs a bit. In the end the book spins off into multiple threads showing the POV of the conflict from all angles, which is great, *but* he spends too much time trying to create tension. Unfortunately the 130 (or so) pages could have been whittled down to 50 or less without much loss.So, Consider Phlebas isn't exactly a dud. The trademark Banks prose is there, the big ideas are there, we get a good dose of Culture history and such, but in the end (literally) it falls a bit flat. Check it out if you already love Banks, if you have never read a Culture book then start with Player of Games and come back to this one later on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HUH5RKDJH864/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031600538X#wasThisHelpful","R2HUH5RKDJH864","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It would be very difficult to find a professional recording studio that doesn't have at least a few of these lying around, and for good reason - they work great for many applications, they are reliable, they can take a beating, and they are a fantastic value given their performance.I use these mics for home recording and I couldn't be happier. I have miked everything from drums, guitars, vocals to woodblocks and even drills/power tools. These mics are fantastic for a closed mic sound as they reject a lot of background noise (so they also work great for playing live). This means they are absolutely fantastic for drums - it's very easy to record multiple tracks with minimal ""bleeding"" coming through on other tracks. I mic all of my drums with these, except I use a Beta 52 for my bass drum, and currently I use lower-end overheads (these are the weak link in my setup). The SM57s aren't fantastic for cymbals.I love how these mics give me a good clean base recording. Using my favorite DAW (Reaper) I can easily liven the sound up with my own reverbs and such. The SM57s will give you a great image; you just apply your own colors.I absolutely love hooking these up to my PA and playing live - since they reject much of the background noise, I can crank my PA up loud and it sounds very clear. Also, these are fairly good at rejecting feedback. When I mic my Marshall amp the guitar comes through incredibly loud and clear. You can certainly find a better mic for vocals (these are a little flat-ish and your singer really needs to belt it to get the most out of these), but for general purpose these work great.Here are the various instruments I have miked, and my opinion on how well these workDrums, Toms (great!)Drums, Snare (very good)Drums, Cymbals (below par)Drums, Kick (not bad)Guitar, Electric (great!)Guitar, Acoustic (good)Bass Guitar (okay)Cajon (good)Bongos (very good)Various Hand Drums (good)Wood Block (very good)Industrial Sounds, for example: power tools (very good)Vocals (good)These mics are a great choice for many applications. They don't shine in every scenario of course, but generally speaking you can't go wrong. Also, these are built like a tank, and if something does go wrong (busted grill for instance), the replacement parts are easy to find.These mics are the staple in my home studio. If you're on a budget and you want something reliable then you certainly can't go wrong with these!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXGK8FNJWPUMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AQRST#wasThisHelpful","RXGK8FNJWPUMT","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hyperion is like a mix between a short-story collection and a MASSIVE prologue. Don't go into this one seeking any real conclusion, really Hyperion is a setup for the next book in the series, Fall of Hyperion. However, don't let this keep you from reading this excellent book. Some of the stories in this book are the greatest I've read to date.Earth has gone to ruin because of an event called the ""Big Mistake"", which happened when scientists were studying farcaster portals. A farcaster portal allows you to travel instantaneously to another portal whether it's in a different city, or an entirely different planet. Farcasters (and most other technology) are controlled by the TechnoCore, which is more or less an incredibly advanced AI. Humans are at war with the Ousters (who are also humans, but have adapted to zero-gravity). The Ousters don't really agree with the TechnoCore. The ousters are obsessed with a planet called Hyperion, which is where a mysterious creature called The Shrike lives, as well as the mysterious Time Tombs, which are moving backwards in time. A war of massive scope is about to take place and in the midst of all this we have a group of seven people who all have something in common; each of them harbors a personal secret and they are all connected to the Shrike in some way. Each person has a wish that they will ask of the Shrike and only one will have their wish granted. To muddy things up even further, one of the pilgrams is secretly an ouster. Each person has a story that they will tell while on this journey and that's what this book is, their stories.Hyperion contains some of the greatest stories I've read thus far. The priests tale is absolutely incredible. There are many times when I read a book and think 'this is just a novelette turned into a fluff-filled novel' but this is one of the rare instances where I feel that the story was too short! I could have read a full blown novel about the priests' tale, just incredible. It's unfortunate that most of the other stories don't quite live up to the priest's tale (though the Scholars tale is also amazing). Still though, even the weakest tale is quite a bit better than most other short stories I've read.The Tethys River and the poets' mansion are some of the coolest ideas I've read about!Dan Simmons is an incredible author. His ideas are great and for the most part his execution is spot-on. There were a few instances where I felt bogged down, but overall I found his writing to be well above par.I give this book an optimistic 4.5 (rounded up to 5 for Amazon).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21CL5MM8R0S03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553283685#wasThisHelpful","R21CL5MM8R0S03","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robots and Empire is the final novel in Asimov's robot universe. Though I haven't read the Empire or Foundation novels (at the time of this review), it is quite clear that Robots and Empire fills in some gaps from his previous works and links the Robot novels to the Empire and Foundation novels. Asimov also strays from the 'whodunit' platform and instead creates a more complex story where we already know who the 'good' and the 'bad' guys are.Please note that this review might contain spoilers from previous novels -Robots and Empire takes place some 200 years after the death of Elijah Baley. Amadiro, who is the head of the Robotics Institute is still quite peeved at Elijah and, well, Earth in general. With the help of Amadiro's new right-hand man Mandamus they devise a plan to destroy Earth. R. Daneel Olivaw and Giskard together must try and stop this. Although Elijah Baley doesn't play a role in solving this problem he does come alive through the recollections of other characters.Robots and Empire was a nice surprise. For me the previous novel Robots of Dawn was the weakest in the series, however in my opinion Robots and Empire might just be the strongest. What I like most about this book is that Asimov breaks away from the murder mystery plotting and instead creates a sprawling story where we get to follow multiple threads. Asimov does a masterful job weaving these threads together. This book spans over 450 pages, which is quite long for an Asimov book, however the story moves at a break-neck pace so it goes by very quickly. Robots and Empire is considerably more complex than the other robot novels are as far as plotting, though it is still an easy read.One of my few complaints surrounds a robot character Giskard. Giskard has the ability to read and manipulate human emotions. The problem is that he is used all too often to get characters out of sticky situations. He's almost a walking, talking deus ex machina. The other complaint I have is that Asimov can get a little repetitive, which may account for some of the extra pages.Though I do have a few complaints on the whole this novel is quite good and is probably my favorite in the series. I highly recommend it! But you must read the other Robot novels to get the most enjoyment out of this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPS70NC40MAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0586062009#wasThisHelpful","R2LPS70NC40MAS","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Midas World is a collection of short-stories by Frederick Pohl. None of these short stories have glaring flaws really, but at the same time I was never really pulled in, with one exception.In Midas World Amalfi Amadeus discovers a way to bring extremely cheap (basically free) energy to our society by using nuclear fusion. There is a big catch - because energy is so cheap the world is forced into mass-consumption. Each person is rationed to consume many goods, everything from plays to sleeping pills. This creates a unique scenario where poor people own extremely large properties, nice cars, etc and rich people can afford their way into a more simple life.Here are the list of stories -""The Fire Bringer"" - I don't really consider this to be a story really. It's only a couple pages and all it talks about is Amalfi's discovery of cheap energy (no rating)""The Midas Plague"" - Mass-consumerism takes hold of human society. The poor are forced to consume rabidly, the rich live more simple lives. (3.5/5)""The Servant of the People"" - Aging congressman Fiorello O'Hare is trying to keep his seat. His challenger, Mayor Thom is a robot. (3)""The Man Who Ate The World"" - Mass-consumerism isn't a problem like it used to be, but one character named Anderson Trumie is a bit indulgent. (3)""The Farmer On The Dole"" - A robotic farmer named Zeb is forced out of farming and into a new profession as a mugger. (3.5)""The Lord of the Skies"" - Nuclear fusion has turned Earth into a wasteland. People now live in stations orbiting Earth, which draw power from Earth. Michael Perkins has an accident while hunting a probe and crashes on Earth. Michael meets up with his brother, whom he doesn't get along with all that well. Robots are everywhere, humans are few and far in between. This is my favorite story in this collection. (4)""The New Neighbors"" - Humans move to an apartment building where all other tenants are robots. Robots are unable to harm the humans, though they don't like them all that much.

"The Road is a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Cormac McCarthy (author of No Country for Old Men, The Orchard Keeper, amongst others) which depicts post-apocalyptic survival.A father and his adolescent son are trekking south after an unknown (to the reader) catastrophic event. The world is barren, cold, unforgiving. The duo hope that by traveling south along a desolate highway to the shores they will find warmth and 'good people'. A majority of this book is spent following the footsteps of the father and son, reading about the horrors they witness along the way, and there are plenty.McCarthy's melancholic prose serves well for the most part, however many passages start to feel repetitive. You are often reading about how cold it is, the ashes, the hunger and he fills in the gaps with short, repetitive dialog between the father and son, plundering or running/hiding from the 'bad people'. At times it felt like McCarthy had to force this into a full-length novel.In the end, I can't help but feel that McCarthy worked to pen the most depressing scenario plotted by the most disturbing circumstances only to depress the readers and make them feel 'moved' by the work. I'm no stranger to depressing books, however often times when I'm finished reading these books I have a lot to think about. This is by no means a terrible book, it did pull at my heart-strings, but when it comes down to it there wasn't much for me to think about after finishing this book other than ""Man, that was effed up!"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TG1KVH0W6P5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307476316#wasThisHelpful","R1TG1KVH0W6P5I","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robots of Dawn is now the most personal of Asimov's Robot/Empire/Foundation universe for me. Parts of this book kick colon, however, parts fail miserably. I'll get to that in a sec -Once again we have a murder mystery for Elijah Baily and R. Daneel Olivaw to unravel, this time on Auroria, home-planet of R. Daneel. Dr. Fastolfe is prime suspect of 'roboticide' by causing a mental freeze-out on Jander Panell, the only other humaniform robot in existence (the other of course being R. Daneel). As we know from Caves of Steel, Dr. Fastolfe is the most brilliant roboticist known, and the creator of the humaniform robot. It is of prime urgency that Elijah prove to the Chairman of Auroria that Han Fastolfe is innocent. This is not only in the interest of Han and Elijah, but for the interest of Earth and humanity.Certain qualities of this book are excellent. For instance Asmimov crafts dialog between characters masterfully. Some people may complain about this book having too much of it, but for me Asimov pulls it off with such force and drive that I feel like reading it forever, often into the wee hours of night.There are aspects of this book that I just didn't like. I love Asimov for the same reason I love a good Pixar movie, it's innocence. Other works of Asimov are very G to PG type material and with Robots of Dawn things change. It just doesn't feel right. Don't get me wrong, I love dark novels, I'm not prude or goodie-goodie at all so it's not an issue of personal hangups, it's more an issue of just feeling like Asimov is trying too hard to be edgy and an author of his caliber just doesn't need to go there.Some of the ideas explored here are infidelity without guilt, um... self-serving sexual satisfaction, sex with robots and sexual tensions between a father and his own daughter. I don't have a problem reading about these ideas, I just have a problem with Asimov writing about them if you know what I mean.The other problem I have is that some of this book feels a bit forced. I can tell where Asimov is force-fitting pieces so that he can tie this whole universe together. The investigation that Elijah goes on itself is well done but certain plot devices used with a character named Giskard are a bit too convenient and a bit corny in my opinion. I wont delve into that because it would be impossible to do so without giving away major spoilers.I hope as I move forward in the Robot/Empire/Foundation series Asimov goes back to just great writing with innocence. I'm reading these books chronologically (with the exception of Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation, those will be last) so hopefully when I move to the Foundation books and his other earlier works they stay consistent with the Asimov's style that I've now come to know and love.Oh well, I'll get over it. I know Asimov's potential and this may just be one of his rare duds for me. I give this one an optimistic 2.5 (rounded to 3 for Amazon). I still very much look forward to reading more Asimov.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FWBRLQA1MFYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553299492#wasThisHelpful","R3FWBRLQA1MFYN","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ringworld: it's bizarre, outlandish, humorous - and in the end it's a fun romp through the mind of Niven.Louis Wu, a 200 year-old human is trying to get the most out of his birthday. As his birthday ends in one part of the world he travels to another (via teleporter) to continue his celebration. Along the way he teleports to somewhere unknown, where an odd 2-headed, 3-legged cowardice of a creature named Nessus persuades him to join his mission. Louis caves in easily because he is sick of the monotony of life. Two more characters are recruited; an attractive, ditzy but incredibly lucky lady named Teela Brown and an easily aggravated, highly impatient feline-ish character named Speaker-To-Animals. Together, under the leadership (or hindship) of Nessus they set out to discover what the Ringworld is. What they discover is almost beyond imagination.When I read about this book I often see it classified as hard sci-fi. I have a hard time calling this book 'hard' sci-fi because much of it seems to be way out of the scope of reality. This book has ships that travel faster than light speed (WAAAAAAY faster), teleporters, alien races moving entire planetary systems, and much more. When I think of hard sci-fi I think of books like Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson - something that actually seems somewhat plausible.Also, I found much of this book to be quite humorous, however when I read other reviews it doesn't seem like most people find it quite as funny as I did. I found myself laughing out loud on a number of occasions but perhaps I'm like the guy who dresses up in green, and starts hissing and laughing at the silver screen during a Snake's on a Plane showing.At any rate, this book is as bizarre as it is fun. I highly recommend checking it out!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TMLFSCBJ317I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345333926#wasThisHelpful","R2TMLFSCBJ317I","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Naked Sun is a sequel to The Caves of Steel featuring Elijah Bailey and his robot partner R. Daneel Olivaw.A murder has taken place on the planet Solaria and it's up to Elijah and Daneel to solve it. However, Solaria is not like Earth. In the future the major cities on Earth are covered by huge metal domes and Earth is greatly over-populated. Humans don't look too kindly at robots. Most humans, including Elijah, are agoraphobic (fear open spaces). On Solaria the human population is very small, everyone lives on massive estates and there are thousands of robots for each human. Humans are bred to fear direct human contact so in order to 'view' each other they use complex holographic technology. Robots cater to every human need. This is pretty much Hell for somebody like Elijah but alas he is called into action.I actually liked the plotting in The Naked Sun a bit more than The Caves of Steel. Because the people on Soliaria are the polar opposite of the people on Earth some interesting situations arise. For example, Earth humans are looked at as dirty animals and the thought of even being in the same room as an Earthman is sickening to a Solarian. Elijah, who craves direct human interaction, is forced to live by himself in a massive estate and he quickly becomes fed up with all of the robots trying to cater to every need of his. Elijah also does some 'growing up' in this novel.One of my minor complaints with Caves of Steel is that some plot elements are a bit too convenient, only to keep the mystery alive. There is still a little bit of that in the Naked Sun, but to a lesser degree.I strongly recommend this book, but read Caves of Steel first if you haven't already.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7FT4N0IV1KYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553293397#wasThisHelpful","R7FT4N0IV1KYP","A3C2A3D2KG1F1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C2A3D2KG1F1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's a beautiful life in on the French Riviera in the 1920s, at least it is for Sara and Gerald Murphy.  They run with a wealthy, talented, and privileged set, including the Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, and their artsy circle.  They have a beautiful home and host lavish parties.  They also have secrets, and when those secrets start to come to light, Sara and Gerald's world is in danger of falling down around them.  Life is not quite so beautiful after all.  In fact, it's actually a story of pain and suffering.I feel like I've read a LOT of books lately that feature the Fitzgeralds as characters.  I guess the Gatsby movie has made this all the rage.  This was not one of the better portrayals of them.  Also, Gerald and Sara's love story just did not engage me as much as it apparently should have.  Klaussman devotes significant attention to the couple falling in love, but I was not drawn in.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R239NO23447Y7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316211362#wasThisHelpful","R239NO23447Y7G","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the center of this book is Kit Noonan, a man trying to uncover his family's darkest secrets.  Aside from his mother, Kit has little knowledge of his family.  To find out more he decides to visit his stepfather, who lives in the middle of the Vermont wilderness.  Amid all sorts of harsh weather, flagrant storms, cold, and isolation, Kit starts to find out more about his family, and the strange secrets that connect him to others.  He also starts meeting family members he didn't know he had.As with her other books, Glass writes beautifully, but she is a slow read.  The prose is dense (not necessarily in a bad way).  Every scene and character is richly rendered.  Kit, an adjunct professor trying to cobble is a living together is a familiar figure to those of us who live and work in academia.

"In an effort to improve her ratings, TV host Hannah agrees to engage in a publicity stunt centered on forgiveness.  The station latches on a recent ""forgiveness stone"" craze, in which people send out stones to people whose forgiveness they need.  There's meant to be a chain effect, as that person then sends out stones.  When Hannah does this, she ends up raking up some ugly issues from her past, and the book delves in to how exactly Hannah got in the position of having to ask forgiveness.I'm not going to lie, one of the things I genuinely liked about this book was how the forgiveness stone craze represents the kind of commercialized pseudo-emotion that seems to be so popular these days (buy some rocks and bring forgiveness to your life!!)  It's also a compelling story about a family with problems, and a broken mother-daughter relationship.  I'd consider it satisfying women's fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RXR2TM54JXY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0147516765#wasThisHelpful","R1RXR2TM54JXY4","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Davis Way is back to uncovering crime and engaging in hi-jinks at the Bellismo Casino. Employed as a special undercover agent at the Bellismo, Davis is expected to uncover and take down criminal operations at the casino. Those who have read the earlier volumes in this series will recall that Davis was hired by the Bellismo because she looks exactly like her boss's wife. She has married the resort's security chief, and they reside in an on-site penthouse apartment. As this volume opens Davis has been forced to take over the special events coordinator's job, after the incumbent walked out of the hotel, never to return. She has also discovered the equipment to print fake currency lodged deep in the walls of her apartment. Then there's the fridge: it doesn't work, and needs to be fixed, except it's a crazy, ugly behemoth no one has ever seen before. Then a group of security professionals show up for a conference, with entertainment consisting of high stakes slot tournaments, and platinum goes missing from the casino vault.The story is a bit nuts, but it's also absolutely hilarious. It's high-energy, high-action, and high-humor. Davis offers significant snarky commentary about her apartment, decorated as if a Party City barfed up a New Orleans themed issue of a decorating magazine. Nothing in this book is expected. If you think you know where there plot is going, you probably don't. I'm excited to see where this series is going to go next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RPGIY7GRXNTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941962777#wasThisHelpful","R1RPGIY7GRXNTV","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book begins as a satire of the health care system and hospital administrators. It turns into a mystery, a shift which is not entirely welcome. Senior physician Abe Nevski returns to his job as a physician in a large Australian teaching hospital. While he has been gone the hospital administration has become more draconian in pushing a program that is meant to (according to the administrators) allocate resources in a utilitarian manner, younger patients and to clearing beds quickly. To Abe, this sounds a lot like withdrawing care and signing death warrants of older patients. The administrators claim that's not the case. Abe thinks otherwise. There have also been a series of unexpected deaths among seemingly stable older patients. Abe tries to figure out what is going on while mentoring his registrar, Rebecca, a young doctor who is becoming disillusioned with the lack of humanity in modern medicine and the hospital-industrial complex. This sets the stage for a showdown between Abe, a doctor who cares about patients and has an excellent bedside manner, with the hospital administration, which is a cold and smarmy as one would expect a hospital administration to be.As a social commentary on the modern healthcare system and cost-cutting measures, this is an excellent book. Komesaroff is a practicing physician. He clearly knows the medicine, the culture of the hospital, and the social issues facing healthcare. Dr. Nevski is a well-developed and believable character, and the hospital world is immersive. Where the book falls flat is as a novel. I found the book's ending to be completely ridiculous. This was such an uneven book. The beginning was excellent, but as the plot becomes more bizarre and more mysterious, it devolves. I utterly disliked where the relationship between Abe and Rebecca wound up (lawsuit!), and, as mentioned, the resolution to the mystery is unsatisfying. I think I would enjoy reading some of Komesaroff's non-fiction, as he clearly wants to address the inhumane elements of modern healthcare.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UQ0HXB56XV1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IXVKY36#wasThisHelpful","R3UQ0HXB56XV1Z","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The rich are different, apparently.  That's what socialite Evelyn discovers as she works on her job building a social networking site for New York's wealthy.  Evelyn has come out of the aspiring class- upper-middle class, with private school education, her parents have had money, but not as much as the truly wealthy.  Evelyn also has a social-climbing mother, whose efforts have led her to resist the appeal of elite self-satisfaction, until her job pushes her further into the lives of the wealthy.  So Evelyn finds herself striving to become one of them.  In so doing she adopts their manners and opinions and bad habits.  This is a comedy of manners for the modern age.The problem with that, is that unlikable characters are harder to stomach when they aren't historical.  It's one thing to recognize a type from a time long past (or even recently past), but when you know you walk among them, it's harder to stomach miserable book characters.  And I really did find most of the characters difficult to relate to, and very hard to like.

"This cat scratching post was very easy to put together.  Simply unscrew the large screw from the post, place post on base, and screw in with a Phillips-head screwdriver.  Setup takes approximately a minute.  So far, so good.  The post has a soft carpet base, with durable scratching rope wrapped around the pole, and a crinkly ball suitable for batting and chewing.  The post is fairly short, so for adult cats who like to stand up to their full height (or close too it) to scratch, this will not be tall enough.  This is a great post for small cats, however, especially kittens!  This post is a great starter size.  Kittens can climb it, but if they make it to the top before their down skills are firmly established, it's not too far to the ground.

"This gold metallic polish dries on the nail to look like a beautiful molten gold.  It has great shimmer.  Essie polishes tend to be quite thin, and this one is thinner than other brands (like OPI, which I see as comparable), but it is a bit thicker than some other Essie polishes I've used, which is a plus.  I often have to do three coats with Essie to get full coverage with no streaks, and this one gave me full coverage in two, which was nice.  I always use base coat.  Like others, I have found that this polish chips rather easily, which is unfortunate.  I had chips on the top of my index fingers the next day, and this was with base coat, two coats of polish, and topcoat.  The other issue for me is that the gold color doesn't really suit my skintone.  I have very pink undertones, and the gold looked a bit out of place on my nails.  That's really just a personal issue.  Someone with different coloring will have a different experience.  It wasn't that the color wasn't pretty (it was), it just would look better on warmer skin tones.

"This is a beautiful red creme polish.  It's really the perfect red tone for me.  I'm very fair with distinctly pink undertones, and this color complements my skin beautifully.  This is a red with a blue base, so much better suited for those with cool skin tones.  I suspect those with warm skin tones would prefer a different red.  In bright light the color looks like a true fire-engine red, and in lower light it appears to be a deeper wine color.  It's really beautiful.  In terms of formula, I have generally found Essie polishes to be quite thin and streaky, and require at least three coats for good, streak-free coverage.  This polish was actually thicker than other Essie polishes I've used (and I was really pleased by that).  I did two coats and got perfect coverage.  Some of my nails looked okay after one coat, but it wasn't universal.  For reference, I always wear a base coat, so I can't comment on how it looks when painted directly on a bare nail.

Fertig has all sorts of descriptions of tasty flavor combinations used to make cakes.  The main character, Claire, is a chef with a kind of synaesthesia that allows her to taste feelings.  She uses those abilities to create cakes that speak to her customers problems.  Claire has recently relocated due to her failing marriage and is creating her own bakery back in her childhood hometown.  A parallel storyline traces two sisters who lived in Claire's town during the Great Depression, and struggled to sustain themselves.  The two stories ultimately weave together at the end.This book is definitely darker historical fiction than what it appears to be on the cover.  I really like that, as I enjoy those sorts of books.  I see this book as a sort of mashup of The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake and The Thirteenth Tale.  I enjoyed it, but if you're looking for a happy baking story, this is probably not your best choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM8PAC50YID4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425277321#wasThisHelpful","RM8PAC50YID4W","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good conditioner, though I'm not sure it does amazing repairs to damaged hair.  This comes in a tiny tube, though you don't need very much to get a full condition.  I have quite a lot of hair, and my hair was fully conditioned with just a bit of this product.  There's mint extract in this conditioner, which surprised me, but I enjoyed it.  It gives a slight mint tingle when first put on the hair, though it doesn't really smell like mint.  To be honest, I wish it smelled mintier and tingled more, but that's hardly a deal-breaker.I find Pantene's conditioners to be pretty darn moisturizing, so while this works well, I'm not sure it's necessary if you're already using a Pantene conditioner.  Certainly it won't hurt, but it is smaller and pricier than regular conditioner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJ6FHNBKD0KS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM9XTQ0#wasThisHelpful","RYJ6FHNBKD0KS","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Melissa Cistaro's mother abandoned her family when Melissa and her brothers were small children.  She only saw her mother a few times growing up.  The absence of Cistaro's mother unsurprisingly deeply affected her childhood, and her experiences as a parent.  In chapters that alternate between past and present Cistaro discusses what missing her mother meant in her childhood and as a mother herself.  The chapters in the present center around Cistaro's trip to see dying mother, whose body has been ravaged by liver cancer and cirrhosis.Cistaro certainly has an interesting story to tell, but I had a hard time getting into this book.  It's not the subject matter so much as the writing style.  I found it to be needlessly overdone.  The subject matter is in itself interesting.  I was fascinated by how in the absence of her mother Cistaro was drawn to objects- trinkets and tokens - to signify and remind her of her mother.  At the end of it it's pretty clear to see that no one really recovers from being abandoned by a mother.  Cistaro has certainly grown into a productive adult, but it's clear the hurt and absence are always part of her life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UMWF7RUBE8HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492615382#wasThisHelpful","R3UMWF7RUBE8HT","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a hefty bottle of sauce that makes an easy, tasty dinner.  I have used to make various stir-frys, and it is so easy and tastes good.  I stir-fried some vegetables and chicken, added the sauce for the last minute or so, put it over rice, and dinner was served.  The sauce is quite spicy (though I'm a bit of wimp, I usually order thai food at 2 on the 4 or 5 scale).  It comes with a handy chart that shows the various add-ins you can use to change the flavor of the sauce.  I can't wait to try pineapple juice.  In any case, this is super handy to have around.

"If you want a nice, basic silver pendant that you can wear with everything, this is a good choice.  This silver butterfly pendant is shiny, and it appears to be well-made.  The silver butterfly wings are more substantial than I was expecting, which was a plus.  The chain hangs at a nice length, and is a box shape with a decent clasp.  The silver shines and sparkles nicely.  The diamonds, such as they are, are quite unimpressive.  Presumably most people realize that at this price point you're just getting little chips.  They're so small that they don't really sparkle.  The silver provides the real sparkle in this necklace.  Honestly, I think this necklace would have been prettier with a series of larger, semi-precious stones, but if you absolutely must have diamonds, this is a very affordable alternative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RKDWW13UQQOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHF37KY#wasThisHelpful","R1RKDWW13UQQOB","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a really dull book, and is not much of a mystery.  The main character, government inspector Anne Marie Laveaud, is not interesting.  Far too much of the book concerns her (uninteresting) domestic life, her parenting, her naval-gazing about her love life (especially the affair she's involved in).  As for the mystery, instead of actual advancement and clues there's just dialogue, dialogue, dialogue.  Laveaud talks to everyone, and it seems like there's more interviewing than actual development of the mystery.  The only thing to really recommend about this book is that the setting is somewhat interesting.  Other than that, I'd recommend giving it a miss.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO2ZEK35YMLZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616953853#wasThisHelpful","RO2ZEK35YMLZ0","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jane Green's books are feel-good stories.  They're the sort of books you read when you want a nice story without too much effort on the part of the reader.  I think of them as the quintessential beach books.  This one is no exception.  The book is basically told in flashbacks, with main character Cat revealing, piecemeal, the details of her alcoholism that nearly destroyed her life.  Cat is trying to make amends in the present for the problems she caused as an alcoholic, and the tension in the book comes from wondering whether she will succeed or not, and what will happen between Cat and her ex-husband.  Like many Green books the result of this one is a bit predictable, but it's still good fun and relaxing to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J5QQN4RJHZ06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125004734X#wasThisHelpful","R3J5QQN4RJHZ06","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to review this book, as it is a short story collection and the publisher provided only a 'sampler' (four of the thirteen stories).  The four stories I read in this sampler were good.  They were suspenseful, and varied enough in mood and setting to keep things interesting.  Even though all the stories are set in New York they highlight the different flavors of the city's neighborhoods and populations.  I'm having a hard time really providing a complete and accurate review for this book because anthologies can be so varied.  Sometimes there's one story that's amazing and the rest are mediocre.  So, the four I read were good, but having no ability to judge the others I can't give the whole book any higher than three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D7RW9LGB5M7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159474761X#wasThisHelpful","R3D7RW9LGB5M7B","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a fun look at some iconic New York foods and the best places to get them.  Robert Sietsema is the food critic for the Village Voice.  He's spent his life analyzing New York's food scene.  In each chapter he picks a significant New York dish and seeks out the best places to find it.  This isn't just a travel guide though.  Sietsema writes about his experiences of each dish, as well as the history of the dish itself.  Some of the dishes are exactly what you expect- things like pizza and pastrami.  There's also things I've never heard of or tried, like cheb, a Senegalese fish and rice dish.  It was interesting to read about the various people and cultures that have contributed to making New York's cuisine.  While I have no plans to travel to New York in the near future, this book was still interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W7HRJXSDKD3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544454316#wasThisHelpful","R2W7HRJXSDKD3Y","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are some well done elements in this book.  The atmosphere is decidedly spooky, and the stories deal with the sort of horror that I think children would find compelling.  Jack, the main character, goes to a house that is reported to be haunted, where supposedly creepy people tell scary tales.  When he arrives he finds this to be true.  Jack becomes the thirteenth at this story-telling gathering, and each person tells their story one by one, disappearing when finished.  The stories cover the range of your basic horror fare, and all of them are quite good at establishing a creepy atmosphere.  What was missing, though, was the sense of suspense, the thing that would make me want to keep reading to figure out exactly what was going to happen.  I think if I had read this as a child I would have grown bored and not finished it.  The atmosphere is well done, but there just isn't enough pay off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCJS7N0PVUHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545816653#wasThisHelpful","R2SCJS7N0PVUHD","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was drawn to this memoir because of the author's condition.  When she was in her twenties doctors discovered that she had a hole in her brain.  How does one live with a hole in the brain (a hole the size of a lemon, to boot)?  In Cohen's case it is with a great deal of experimentation and good humor.  Cohen grew up knowing there was some sort of problem.  There were certain tasks that were impossible for her.  She couldn't keep basic tasks straight, she couldn't cross the street.  In childhood these things were believed to be learning disabilities.  As an adult Cohen's brain issue makes work almost impossible.  One of the things that is very obvious in this book is that Cohen is lucky to have a supportive family.  Had she not had a familial support system, this story would look quite different.  Cohen's diagnosis is extremely unusual.  No one really knew what to tell her, what the best practices for living with a hole in brain would be.  The second half of the book focuses on Cohen's efforts to find a way to create a livable life as a disabled adult.  Cohen is witty, and she is a good writer.  That said, I would have appreciated more context in this book.  Obviously, having a large hole in one's brain is an all-encompassing experience, but I wanted to know more about how Cohen's experience fit in with larger issues in how people deal with neurological problems, physical disability, and learning disabilities.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15DLHYIXCGBWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627791892#wasThisHelpful","R15DLHYIXCGBWI","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cleansing cloths are certainly convenient.  For times when you're out and about and want to get your makeup off, cleansing cloths are a great solution.  I find them particularly useful for going to the gym after work, when I've still got makeup on but don't want to sweat through it.  This pack can be tossed easily in a gym bag or purse, and travels well.  I generally liked the orange and mint scent.  That said, I wouldn't recommend these for times when you don't need an on-the-go solution.  I don't think these work as well as a traditional cleanser that one would use at home, in one's bathroom.  I wouldn't want to be using these all the time and chucking all the extra waste they create into landfills.  I also wasn't all that fond of the exfoliating texture.  I don't have sensitive skin, but I found the nubs on the cloths to be unnecessarily irritating.  I'd prefer these with a smoother texture.  In general, if you understand the limits of these cloths, and like exfoliation, I suspect you'll be happy with these.  Don't expect a do-all wonder cloth.  Expect a convenience product that delivers well for what it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK9RETUZ2ZWFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6HAOYA#wasThisHelpful","RK9RETUZ2ZWFE","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A rash of suicides and a mystery narrator create the basis for this suspense/mystery.  A series of suicides in the village of Radcote have the local population on edge, but the book suggests that there may be more to these suicides than meets the eye.  Police detective Lorraine Fisher is vacationing in the town, and she begins to try and unravel the strange occurrences.  There are many, many potential suspects, and everyone in Radcote seems to be hiding explosive secrets.  All of them are engaged in things that seem to be a bit off, but we are left wondering why and what in most of these cases for the duration of the book.  Even Lorraine's sister Jo, who is hosting her sister the detective, is caught up in the culture of mystery.  Her marriage is faltering and her nephew mysteriously goes missing.  There's a lot going on in this book, as there is a LOT going on in Radcote.  There's definitely suspense, and I definitely wanted to find out who the mysterious and unidentified persons are (especially the narrator who opens the book).  That said, this wasn't necessarily as satisfying as some other British police procedurals I've read.  It seems like Hayes went for many story lines, rather than fully developing a few, and this is often to the book's detriment.  Sometimes there's just too much going on to keep it all straight, and the addition of yet another mystery keeps the reader confused rather than satisfied.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18QSS4H5I7X44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804136920#wasThisHelpful","R18QSS4H5I7X44","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many women Patricia Morrisroe loves shoes, and in this book she sets out to talk about the important moments of her life via the shoes she wore.  From childhood and school, through awkward teenage years to adulthood, marriage, and family, Morrisroe focuses each chapter of her memoir around a pair of meaningful shoes that defined her experiences.  This is an episodic memoir, one that touches on Morrisroe's various life experiences.  The author grew up in a town very near my own hometown, so I enjoyed the regional flavor and references in this book. The childhood experiences of Stride Ride shoes really resonated with me.  This is one of those memoirs that isn't about an unusual life so much as it is about a recognizable life.  Much of what Morrisroe lived through will be quite familiar to those who grew up in suburban, middle-class America. In general I found this book to be a quick and fun read.  It's not the deepest or most profound book I'll read this year, but it was reasonably entertaining, and had enough recognizable moments to keep my interest.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TOVWYZMQJNEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592409245#wasThisHelpful","R2TOVWYZMQJNEN","A3R9H6OKZHHRJD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R9H6OKZHHRJD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not going to lie, this air conditioner is kind of a beast.  It's big and its heavy.  It's bigger and heavier than a window unit.  I can easily lift a window air conditioner up into the window by myself, but there's no way I can lift this monster on my own.  Once you get this up and running there's wheels on the bottom, so you can wheel it from location to location within the house, but be advised that getting it into the house is going to be a chore.  Likewise, hauling up and down the stairs is going to be a burden.  I also found the set-up to be much more involved than with a window unit.  That said, in terms of functionality this air conditioner seems to work well.  It's currently April, so I can't test it against 90 degree weather, but it seems work well.  I noticed that others have been having leaking problems.  As I received this in April I'm not running it for days at a time, but it's something I'm going to be watching out for, and I will update my review if need be.

"The label is slightly misleading when it says ""non-programmable"" -- it can be programmed for Home-Sleep-Away and those settings must be cleared after installation if you don't want to mess with them. The cool/heat - on/auto settings are slider buttons that one can use a fingernail or thumb to move. My only wish is that these were backlit, too. I know next to nothing about electricity, so I had mine installed by a service tech. I do not recommend trying it yourself unless you know your way around a circuit board and wires.

"I've been wet shaving all my life and I've perfected it. But I'm also tired of it. Thanks to all the careful reviewers here on Amazon, this Braun 7-790 offered a chance to break out of my lifelong routine and boy am I glad I did! My first shave with this was a pleasant surprise all around. I had tried a Braun 25 years ago and remember it tearing out the hairs one-by-one and promptly went back to the blade. But this razor is quiet by comparison to other electric shavers, does a great job on a couple of trouble growth patterns on my face, and except for getting a better mirror to see if I had missed any spots, each pass was almost effortless. I don't save any time over wet shaving in my case, but the convenience and total cost of ownership will eventually be noticeably better. I would recommend this razor to anyone and I'll definitely never be without a Braun again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AQ1OIII0ASMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YJAZZ4#wasThisHelpful","R1AQ1OIII0ASMT","A1JXNXW4MDXJKO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JXNXW4MDXJKO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hook it up to your TV, plug it into the outlet, turn on your TV, change your audio settings for external output via the recognized Vizio soundbar, and voila! it works. Remote works just fine, too, but it's not needed since it integrates with both my TV and cable remote.

When your arms are stretched out, you can add another 20-24 inches to that height. Still, this will be handy for many jobs and projects around the house, notably a kitchen remodel and painting the high corners and wall edges. Very well-built, the safety bar is stable and the lock releases are on the side unlike what is pictured here. The wheels are surprisingly useful, too.

"Blindmark's cutout tool is so ingenious you won't want to live without it. It's simple: insert (or snap in) the magnet in your electrical box, set your wallboard in place, literally toss the cover magnet at the wall and it positions itself right over the other magnet, and voila!, outline around the outer magnet, and then cut out around the box. Done! No need for measuring, estimating, or any of those steps. And it's accurate every single time. It even does double and quad outlet boxes, too. Delivery is prompt.

"For some reason I thought this tool would be loud, would take a long time to charge, would be used, and would be damaged upon receipt. At least that's according to some reviews. I got the tools I ordered, in the right case, new, and they work better than expected! I read about the 826 impact driver in Family Handyman magazine and they loved it, but said it was loud. It's not. Heck, even driving 4"" deck screws into treated wood, it's quieter than my regular 8-amp corded drill. For about $30 more, this kit throws in the screwdriver which gives you a second battery. That makes this a great bargain by any measure for a lithium-ion powered tool.

"From the reviews of its individual volumes, there's little I can add here. The biggest complaints are Kenny's cutoff date of 1975 (30 years to the first volume's publication), that ""he didn't give enough pages to Philosopher X!,"" and that he downplayed the contributions of 20th century Continental philosophers. It's easy to think that our favorite (and recent or current) philosopher is not just a fad but so important that his greatness just isn't appreciated! Yet this is the same complaint with EVERY history of philosophy. Yes, with every single one. Better it would been to have added a fifth volume for 20th century philosophy. At least Kenny recognizes that many philosophies do not survive far beyond their own day and looking back, seem faddish. Thus his short-shrift of postmodernism (Have we really learned much beyond the original writings up to 1981?).Kenny does something rare, which is to credit the influence that Marx, Darwin, and Freud had on philosophy, even though they rarely can be counted as philosophers. Intended as an introductory undergraduate text, it's really good as such. Don't ask it to be comprehensive and don't ask Kenny to give your favorite philosopher more pages than another in the same period. As is, it's pretty fantastic and a welcome history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWS1A3HFDI0YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199589887#wasThisHelpful","RWS1A3HFDI0YY","A1JXNXW4MDXJKO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JXNXW4MDXJKO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When I go into a home, for example, that has an unfinished basement, for some reason there are always thousands of nails in the joists -- who does that! But these 358 nippers can either snip a nail head flush with a wall, ceiling, baseboard, floor, or joist, or it can effortlessly extract it by rolling it out. You'll never want to use a hammer to extract a nail again since this 358 plier rolls the nail out without marking the face of the board or wall. Also, its handles are curved so that all four fingers can apply equal pressure, giving you more torque. Another use is to cleanly shape material, corners, and edges. I can enlarge a wallboard cutout for an electrical outlet in a precise way rather than using a ziptool or using a clumsy hand saw. No matter what, make sure you have this tool in your belt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OED4LUCYJ1D5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SBD8#wasThisHelpful","R3OED4LUCYJ1D5","A1JXNXW4MDXJKO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JXNXW4MDXJKO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While looking to update my flatware I poured through reviews to try and get info on these sets. I found there wasn't a whole lot of information and a lack of pictures showing detail. Here is all you need to know and more about this set:Service for 12 (not 14) but it includes 12 extra tea spoonsFlatware is stamped with Gorham 18/10 steel from Vietnam. All flatware pieces I received had detail on front and back.It is very shinny and does smudge and leave fingerprints that may bother some.Knifes are not serrated but have an edge and are sharp. Much sharper than standard serrated butter knives.They do not stack in a drawer organizer and slip around after about 3 pieces high.  I asked this question and many said they do stack. They don't.The size of this set is dinner. It is not Continental/European so the spoon ""bowl"" is narrow. I find the teaspoon bowl size to be a tad too small and prefer the larger spoons. Usually the larger spoons are too large but they work great for cereal. So to me this is a plus because both sets of spoons are usable where my last set we barley ever touched the larger spoons.I got an organizer to go with this set and it isn't deep enough. Keep in mind that this has 12 service pieces each and most organizers are meant for 8. Id say at least an 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep is needed so they don't pour over the top. Especially because they don't stack and fall over. Though the organizer I got claimed to be 2"" the actually height of the separators was barley over an inch.I am rating this set a 5 because it is a very lovely high quality set. Personally it's just not my preference as I really wanted flatware that stacked and was continental sized. Hopefully I will grow to love it because for  $130 it wasn't cheep.Please mark this review as helpful so that I can help others in deciding if this is the flatware for them.

All it has to do is sit in the drawer so I understand that its not built to withstand abuse but it didn't even make it to the drawer without breaking.

"I really thought I would love this item as it should catch in the bottom and prevent a mess. The flap is hard plastic and really difficult to get on and off.  It a big annoyance when your cooking and have to struggle with it every time you need to empty it. If you don't fully connect the bottom it wont work because of the ""squish"" collapsible sides. Also when grating, cheese it comes out before it hits the bottom because the sides don't go up all the way and leave a great gap. It is also hard to clean because it doesn't fully open and is no narrow at the top.  I would go back to my dollar store grater but i'm making myself use it because of how pricey it was.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T5IBLOZP6RY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUTZOOC#wasThisHelpful","R2T5IBLOZP6RY8","A3E2J1JTC16V50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E2J1JTC16V50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was the only kennel I found that came closest to airline requirements. It is approved by the USDA and IATA. We were on a military move from the states so this a review on the international kennel features and requirements only.Kennel Features:This kennel has 11 plastic bolt holes- This is the only requirement that this kennel does not follow. It came with plastic nuts. Metal nuts and bolts are required now for every flight. This carrier has 11 bolt holes plus an additional 4 tie down holes. My airline specifically said that every hole must have a bolt. So we needed 15 metal nuts and screws for the carrier. Some airlines let you leave the 4 tie down holes empty but check to be sure and order the bolts ahead of time to get the right amount. We dind't do this and had to buy 3 kits because of shipping time limits. Metal bolts on amazon did not have prime option. But these are what you need Pet Carrier Metal Fasteners Nuts Bolts (1-1/4"" Medium Bolts, 16 Pack) 16 pack will ensure a better safe than sorry amount.Has Pre drilled zip tie holes- Hard to find kennels with this already done. It is a requirement to zip tie the kennel doors shut. Quick release are best. Helping Hand Assorted Quick Release Nylon Cable Ties, 8-inch Make sure you insist on zip tying your dogs yourself! I watched the security guy do it wrong and had to redo do it myself. So glad I got the quick release. Same thing happened to a friend only they didn't catch that the attendant only thread it though the hole and not the door. Their dog got loose in the belly of the plane after ripping off the door. This brings me to the next feature.Has single piece metal door- Be sure to follow this guideline, a metal single piece door. No plastic allowed! Some larger kennel doors have a fold in the middle of the door to make packing easier. Some airlines don't specify the type of door needed and some forbid the fold. It gives the dog the ability to pull the door in which will then collapse and allows for escape. This kennel door is a solid one piece.Has protruding bar/side handles- This follows the requirement of ""a spacer rim protruding at least 3/4 on all sides with ventilation openings""This is so the airline can carry and move the kennel without using the handle (known to fail on some kennels) and prevent a dog from being able to bite or contact movers hands. This kennel states that the rim is designed to work as side handles.Has 4 sides of air holes- Requirement is air holes must be ""on all four sides at least halfway on each side"".  This kennel has it and even better metal grates! I had a friend whose dog chewed the space between the plastic holes during flight. Some kennels show in the picture that they have air holes in the back but come to find after ordering they didn't have the air holes on the backside in the smaller sizes. Especially for cat carriers. Note- Domestic flights only requires 2 vent sides but they stack and pack kennels like baggage and airflow will be restricted. Go with ventilation on all sides.Food Dishes- These were actually deep enough to be functional. Kennels with dishes attached inside on the walls are not allowed. Airlines must be able to ""access dishes attached to door without opening the kennel door"" they do this through funnels. On my main international flight with 2 layovers and a total of 20 hours travel they did not feed or water my dogs once. Even though it's the law. My advice freeze water ahead of flight so it doesn't make a mess or even better get a lixit water bottle to ensure your dogs don't dehydrate. We got Lixit Small Dog Water Bottle 16-OunceStickers- This kennel came with stickers and that is a requirement but airlines have them and will use their own as well. The stickers included are crap and leave an awful residue. The airlines put the sticker packet of paper work over the "" ""Live Animal"" in 1-inch letters on the crate's top"" required sticker. Upon removal of that it lifted the sticker below mucking up the brand new kennels. My advice, bring the stickers and apply at check in where they are needed once the paperwork covers the entire top of kennel and use airline stickers if possible.Note for size- The length requirement for international travel is [their length + half their leg] so there must be ample room in front and back. This made us need the larger kennel which is much larger than our previous kennel. Some will say that the rule of thumb is as long as they can turn around it's okay. But that is the length rule for IATA. Height for IATA includes ears and ears cannot touch top of kennel while standing. Again, why we had to go up a size (dang chihuahuas). After traveling with my pets on over 6 different flights I can say that most airline attendants are clueless about the pet requirements needed. I had one tell me they don't even receive training on the requirements and offered to let both dogs go into one kennel (a international no no). But I did have had one who knew their stuff and used a tape measure. So better safe than sorry!Traveling with your pet no matter how far is stress full. With international flights being long dogs get anxious and try to escape, sometimes successfully in cheep kennels. So get this one! Airlines have different requirements and regulations. It's better to buy new then to try to modify existing kennels. Save yourself the time! Get this kennel and you only need to purchase zip ties (hand release are best), metal bolts, and some puppy pads. I realize this is much more info than necessary for a review but I know how hard it was getting this information. Please check this as helpful so that it may help others in the complicated kennel requirement process.

"This came 2 weeks after estimated delivery time so there's that. But 3 stars for the product itself. The instructions were for a completely different model neither my handy husband nor I could figure out how to attach the handle grip and had to monkey with the tool itself to figure it out. We've never used or owned a hammer drill. It is still difficult to drill into our concrete walls but the drill does make it possible. I've had a few instances where the drill bit has been stuck into the wall because the key didn't lock it in correctly. This may be from the lack of directions and/or operator error. Also the drill and packing reeked and still does. My tool drawer stinks! It was only 30$ but I gladly have paid more just to get rid of the odor.

"I bought this not to encourage my pet to drink more but to rotate the water through a filter to keep debris out and keep it from being stagnate. One think that I was looking forward to was the lever that adjusts water flow. I've tried every which way and it doesn't seem to make a difference at all in water flow. One thing I was very surprised to find was that the water stays cool. We live on hot island and the old water dish turned to room temp very quickly. It isn't supposed to keep the water cool but it does for me. The main purpose of the fountain is to make dogs drink more but my dogs drink the same as always and were slightly intimated by the fountain. But our family has noticed that the sound of the waterfall (we can hear it from the kitchen in the living room) makes us ""go"" more often which makes us drink more! The water sound was noticeable but doesn't bother me anymore.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NI2N5VORJQWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MYIDK4#wasThisHelpful","R3NI2N5VORJQWI","A3E2J1JTC16V50","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E2J1JTC16V50?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My family and I are long-time travelers around the globe, and have developed definite opinions of travel guides over the years. Along with planning travel over the internet, we've basically settled on two different guides to take with us as we go. The Eyewitness Travel Guides are my preference for advanced planning and reading on a particular destination. The Lonely Planet Guides are perfect for our travels while we are on the road. Lonely Planet fills in many of the details that Eyewitness leaves off the pages of their travel guides. Eyewitness gives us the visual for where we are heading, Lonely Planet gives us the filler. Between the two, we've settled on a routine that has suited us well for our travel purposes. Highly recommended!Having lived in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the U.S. for many years...I can attest to the high quality of this guide book.  We aggressively traveled throughout the region, but still did not see all that is offered in this guide.

"Being the owners of a new dachshund puppy, we needed a good and cost effective solution to keep the rugs clean beyond the power of simple vacuuming.  In the past we've rented carpet cleaners from the local hardware store to do the job, or even broken out the 30+ year old Kirby with a carpet cleaning module.  While those option work pretty well, they are quite a pain to work with and inconvenient, thereby reducing the frequency of our carpet washings.  I was not looking for the world's greatest carpet cleaning system, just something convenient, cost effective, and effective.  This Bissell works great for those purposes.  It was easy to assemble, and easy to use.  It does a very good job of cleaning, especially after out young puppy, a task for which this device was specifically designed.

"I've spent a lot of my literary hours over the last few years dedicated to understanding the many complexities and undertakings of the First World War.  I've read many books of the events between the famous assassination in Sarajevo in June 1914 and the Guns of August erupting one and a half months later.  I've read books on the battles and weaponry that carried on and were developed through the war.  I've read books about the American experience in the air and in places like Belleau Wood.  However, in all that I've read, very little has been penned about the subject matter Adam Hochschild delves into in ""To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914-1918"".As it turns out, the subject matter of the struggle between those who favored fighting the war and those who strongly raised voices of protest against the war is a large void in the previous books I've read.  If there was ever a war were voices of dissension were necessary, it was the First World War.  While I am far from a left winger, and am in fact quite conservative in my thinking, I truly appreciate the efforts of those voices trying to ring through in the futility of this mortal combat between 1914 and 1918.  Further, the stories of individuals on both sides of the war equation are highly compelling and readable.  For any student of the war, this is a must read.

"While I do not consider myself an audiophile or audio snob, I definitely appreciate a good pair of headphones.  My primary concerns are quality and sound...in that order.  I listen to hours and hours of audio through my headphones at work each day, so expect a good pair to hold up and sound good for at least a year and a half.  While I haven't had this pair that long, I am impressed with what I've seen (or hears) so far.  They are well constructed.

It doesn't get snagged around my desktop as I shift around; instead it moves with me...big plus!  The audio sound is fine...not the greatest...but sounds really good.  In terms of the app for the android: I've used it a few times, and it does the trick with one click of the button.  Don't think I will use that feature much though...so the niche factor of an Android headset seems less appropriate.

"My wife is not a fan of large or dangly earrings, preferring instead simple earrings usually consisting of a solitary pearl.  When I saw these earrings here on Amazon I jumped at it, confident my wife would love them.  She did!  With three separate pair of earrings included in the package - two separate pearl sets, plus one Cubic Zirconium - it was a fantastic deal.  The pearls were slightly larger than the style of pearl earrings she typically wears, but they are very comfortable according to her.  I can testify that they look great, and seem well constructed.  Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDENS46WE3DFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ANKD2U#wasThisHelpful","RDENS46WE3DFZ","A1U1ALQQMB6J22","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U1ALQQMB6J22?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This heavily encrypted hard drive does everything I could ask it to do.  It comes with everything you need to transfer files from your computer or other device onto the hard drive - USB, FireWire and eSata cables, power cord, encryption keys (3x), backup software, and even key chains.  The one missing item that would be helpful is a case to carry the hard drive.  Since I mainly plan on using this while I travel (which is justified by the encryption/protection of the device) a case would come in very handy.  File transfer speeds were as expected, not overly fast or too slow, but just what you would expect.  I had zero issues transferring files onto this hard drive and between devices, though I did not try out the included software.

"Do you ever feel like you just weren't made for these times?  So do I, and so does Kat Edmonson.  Her new album, her sophomore production titled ""Way Down Low"", transports you back to the time period you likely find most agreeable - whatever that time period may be.  This album is different in some ways from her first, which in my opinion was a triumph.  ""Down Low"" is a bit bluer and softer.  While the tone may be different, Kat's voice is the same - amazing; though ""Hopelessly Blue"" brings her deeper than we've heard before.  The exception to this bluesy tone is ""Lucky"", which though we've heard it before, excels on this album.  Also of note is ""I'm Not it Love"", which is fun and playful.  On the whole, Kat scores big.  I truly enjoyed this album; and if you are a fan of Kat Edmonson, I know you will as well.

"First and foremost...""The Crimean War: A History"" is an incredible read.  Figes delves into many aspects of the war, all in tremendous and thoroughly readable detail.  The part of the book I liked and appreciated the best is the significant portion he dedicates to the lead-up to the war, describing its many causes, some of which (like the sectarian and religious aspects) being thoroughly explored beyond what other books have done in the past.  While the author encourages readers who are only interested in the military campaigns for skip the initial section, I highly discourage that, for in doing so you will miss the best section of the book.  He also does a fine job of describing the aftermath and mythology of the Crimean War.  There were some significant lessons to be learned, which were substantially glossed over and romanticized in later years - meaning the lessons had to be re-learned.  For me, the weakest part of the book (though while by no means inadequate) were about the military campaigns of the war.  Most importantly, the maps on the Kindle were lacking in detail, and in some case were not to be found at all.  This is inexcusable for the section on describing military maneuvers.  Beyond that one small quibble... the book is thoroughly engaging and enjoyable.  Recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18CI42Y6MBQ9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250002524#wasThisHelpful","R18CI42Y6MBQ9E","A1U1ALQQMB6J22","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U1ALQQMB6J22?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I would give it more than 5 stars.  It is a hair treatment that has the consistency of a medium thick conditioner that you scoop out of a small tub.  It doesn't have a strong odor or any that I notice.  I have very fine hair, but a lot of it. It is wavy  and breaks easily when it grows past my shoulders.  I had been experiencing a lot of breakage since trying to grow my hair long and had used many conditioners and treatments attempting to stop the wad of hair I would pull out of the drain every time I showered.  Since using this I have had much less breakage and clogged drains.  I use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner then towel dry my hair and spread 2 quarter size amounts of this through my hair, first on the ends then all the way through.

"This is the third, and final, book in this trilogy. You must read them in order. This is an amazing read, all three books are.This review is hard to write. I donât want to give anything away. There are so many twists, turns, and unexpected things in The Devilâs Kiss.Rue Volley has a way of writing that just completely sucks you into the story. She keeps you guessing about what will happen next. I honestly didnât see any of it coming.We do meet a few new characters. Abiâs aunt and cousins, and another character. Her aunt is really funny. I loved her.I really felt for Abi. She goes through so much in this book and deals with a lot. She is strong though.Donât worry, both Avery and Sam are in The Devilâs Kiss also.Everything is wrapped up by the end of the book. All questions are answered.âsometimes fate has its own agenda and we are simply at its mercy.âI am so very sad to see the end of this trilogy. This is a definite must read and these three books are some of the best Iâve read this year. And I think itâs Rueâs best work, which is saying a lot since I have loved everything of hers that I have read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXRRWQAJ1L5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0186I0IO0#wasThisHelpful","R3GXRRWQAJ1L5D","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsThis is such a great read. I think every woman, whether big or small, has dealt with body image issues.  I really connected with Willow.  Thankfully, I have never had to deal with the verbal abuse from family.  Well, besides the âniceâ comments from âwell meaningâ family members.  Iâve always had my parents support and I found my Kane twelve years ago and have been happily married for ten years.  He thinks Iâm beautiful, no matter how much I gain, or loose.#iAmWillow#IamPerfectlyImperfectWe see Willow at her lowest.  We see her struggle, but most of all, we see her change so much.  She goes from fearful, and some would even say weak, to strong and fearless.  I donât think sheâs weak, but after a lifetime of the verbal abuse from people that were supposed to love her, sheâs been beaten down.Kane says it best.âThere isnât beauty in perfection.  Itâs as fake as the image the word projects.  Beauty is found in imperfection, Willow, because to admit youâre not perfect means youâre admitting youâre not whole and absolute.  When I think of myself, I see someone willing to admit heâs far from complete as it gets because, in order to get to that perfection, I need to find the other part of me who will make my life better.  To take all the faults I have and fill them, and only then will I be there.  You see, the way I see it, the only way to become perfect is to find that perfectly imperfect person who brings it out of you.âWills shows us that the only opinion of us that should matter to us, is our own.This is the best Harper Sloan book yet, and I love her other books too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DIF72ILFPB6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1518893414#wasThisHelpful","R1DIF72ILFPB6C","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsThis is the first book by Brandace and Justin Morrow that I have read.  Itâs definitely a series I will continue to read.  A lot of times, when there are two authors writing, you can tell who wrote what because of the styles and it can mess with the flow of the book.  This isnât one of those.Iâm a sucker for a good MC, or a military read, I got both with this book.  The way the flashbacks and PTSD/TBI scenes were written, you can tell it was from personal experience and not âresearchâ.  A lot of authors just write that the characters suffer from it, and sometimes, make light of the effects it can have.  As a military spouse, that has friends struggling and dealing, it pisses me off.  Iâm happy to say, this book didnât piss me off.Grace is a pastorâs daughter that is supposed to have an arraigned marriage.  She canât do it.  Her family is basically like the Duggars.Since she canât go through with the wedding, she pulls a Julia Roberts and becomes a runaway bride.She runs from one extreme right into anotherâ¦Ronin MC and Tread.I really liked these characters and Iâm wondering what will happen next.

"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsThis is the third book in the Death Dealers MC series.

I will say, I had an idea of who was behind it, but I was wrong.  And thatâs a great thing because I usually figure it out right away.Gage is amazing.

"This is the first book by Jessica Wilde that I have read.  It definitely will not be the last one though.  As soon as I read the synopsis, I had to sign up for this blog tour and review this.  I was not disappointed.  This is a very emotional read.  I knew it would be when I started crying during the prologue.  There were many other parts of this book that had me crying as well.  I felt for, and my heart broke, for both Merrick and Grace.Merrick and Grace are both suffering loses.Merrick has just returned home from overseas.  Heâs injured, he lost some of his men.  He lost his sight, has burns on the left side of his body, broken leg and arm.  Heâs hurting, but itâs more than just the physical hurt.  He is suffering from PTSD.  Heâs angry.  He feels guilt.What I loved about how Jessica wrote Merrick, she didnât make light of PTSD.  I have read other books where the author just makes it seem like PTSD is a common cold and something thatâs easy to get rid of, or something that just flares up.  Jessica didnât do that.  She did her research.  Iâve seen the effects of PTSD first hand. I know that itâs not something that comes and goes, itâs always right there.  Thatâs how it is with Merrick.  There isnât a fast cure.Merrick is a fighter though, he just needs a push.  And he gets that from Grace.Grace has just moved back home after suffering her own loss.  She had the biggest crush on Merrick when they were in high school.  But he never saw her.

"I received this item in exchange for an honest review.With that said, they are great for a beginner.  Especially since you can adjust the clamp easily.  I have used clamps before and usually need tight for stimulation.  With these I couldn't, which should have been a sign.  We found out a week later that there's a baby on the way.  It would be nicer if the chain was a little bit longer.  But it still works great.  The rubber padding/cover on the clamps makes it so that the clamps don't cut into your nipple.If you are looking for clamps to try out for the first time, I think these would be great for you.  They are great quality, especially for the price.Now they will set in my toy box for the next 9-10 months until I can play again lol","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13E3L7WD0ZWHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQIB3SC#wasThisHelpful","R13E3L7WD0ZWHM","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second book in this series.  I highly, and strongly suggest you read them in order.  This book takes place at the same time as the previous book, but is centered around other characters.  Don't worry, Bronson and Callie are in this book as well.This is Dakota and Bianca's story.  Be prepared for a roller coaster ride of emotions in this story.  Both characters are a mess at times.  They really do love each other though.  But at some points, it's almost toxic.""Bianca, you've driven me crazy since you were sixteen years old.  You're everything I didn't know I wanted, and so much more.  I've loved you as long as I can remember.  I know s*** went down with us, partly my fault and the way I handled it, but I didn't know what else to do.  Baby, those same circumstances aren't in the way now.""While I can understand why both of them are hurting, and why Dakota did what he did.  I still love them both, but mad at him at the same time.I am undecided if I want them to finally work things out, or if what they have is a toxic love story.I don't know if I want what is coming next, after that ending, to happen or not.Plus there is Heath.  Heath is a great guy, but he almost seems too perfect....hhmmmmmmUgh, I'm so confused about what I want to happen!Leigh Ann wrote another great book.  And I didn't need any kleenex this time!  I can't wait for the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XDZJ0EGL6Z52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016UZ3D5C#wasThisHelpful","R2XDZJ0EGL6Z52","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsThis is a great read.  I loved it.  This is the third book in the Stipped series.  I highly suggest that you do read them in order.  Even though the main characters are different, you do see them in the other books.Both Ivan and Candy have messed up pasts.  We donât get all of Ivanâs, but you can guess and put together what happened to him when he was younger.Candy, or Candace, wow, just wow.  She escaped a cult when she was sixteen and Ivan found her.  Ivan took her in, gave her what she needed like clothes, food, an education.  She wanted to work at the Grand though.  I didnât realize Candy was so young in the other books.I donât want to go into too many details because it would give things away.  This is a series that is a must read for me when a new one comes out.We do see Ivan open up and admit his feelings.  I wasnât expecting that, at all.âYouâre all I can f****** think about every second of every f****** day.  I have to know what youâre doing, where you are.  I havenât treated you right, and the worst part is, I donât think Iâm capable of it, but if thereâs one thing Iâve never done, itâs ignore you.âJust a warning, if you donât like the daddy/little girl type relationships you may want to not read this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27I9NFKKPHWK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016SFKK0U#wasThisHelpful","R27I9NFKKPHWK6","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I signed up for an ARC of this book, I didnât realize that it was the third book in the series.  Itâs fine to be read as a standalone though.I hate giving lower than three stars.  But I had to really push myself to finish this.  A book this length usually takes me two to three hours to read.  This took me two days to finish.  It just didnât grab me.  I couldnât connect to the characters at all and I found myself rolling my eyes at them a lot.I like the men in books to be alpha.  To be strong.  To know what they want and to go after it, and get it.That isnât Luc at all.  I found him very whiney.  Every thought of his was about how he isnât good enough.  How everyone is better at everything than he is.  He keeps saying he needs to talk to Cam, but he never does, they just have sex.I couldnât even say heâs a beta male.  I found him weak.Cam is just as immature as he is.  She has the same âIâm not good enoughâ thoughts as Luc does.When they both keep saying, or thinking, these doubts, every chapter, itâs annoying.There isnât an epilogue, so youâre only left with the ending.  Thereâs a lot left hanging in the air.  Itâs not a cliff hanger though.I donât think I will read more in this series.The writing itself was good.

When I saw Until Him series, Until Jax, it was a must sign up read for me!  I loved this book also.  Both the Until Her series and the Until Him series are spinoffs of the Until series.  These two series are about the kids of the original characters.  Iâm loving the âkidsâ just as much.  Although, they definitely arenât kids anymore.This is Jaxâs story.

"This is a good read and does end in a cliffhanger that has me totally thrown off right now.  I finished reading this about 10 hours ago, but needed to wait to get my thoughts right in my head.The major issue I had was that Clove and her brother knew right away that Turner wasn't Turner at all.  It was actually Trent, Turners long lost, forgotten, identical brother.  Clove's brother Zack, is a cop, but they never arrested Trent.  I understand they wanted to make sure Turner stays alive, but still.  I think that if the changes in Turner wouldn't have been figured out so fast, it would have built the anticipation more.  It would have built up more for me if the evil twin angle wasn't revealed right at the beginning.The epilogue has me a bit confused.  If it is Trent, not Turner, how would her family not know?  Wouldn't Zack have finger printed to find out which twin it is?  I'm hoping the next book will clear this up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JI4GMDNPFXIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1511539399#wasThisHelpful","R3JI4GMDNPFXIG","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was a quick read for me.  It was okay.  But my biggest issue was the timeline at the end.  It doesn't add up.  This book is comparable with the others with the development of Cason and Henley's relationship.  We don't really see it happening.  We see it start, but then it jumps ahead.  There's more sex scenes than the relationship developing.  Don't get me wrong.  I love a great sex scene, but some of these just felt like filler to me.  There were some other inconsistencies throughout the book as well.  Maybe it's the beta reader in me, but I usually pick up on these and it bugs me.I also found it predictable, I knew right away who was after Henley and wanted her out of the picture.  Some of the story line felt unfinished to me also.I know I'm in the minority with my opinion, so I would say that if you've read the other books, and liked them, you'll probably like this one as well.I did like seeing the softer side to Cason.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGQT3MFWNRKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSZ3Y3S#wasThisHelpful","RWGQT3MFWNRKK","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When I first started reading this, and got to the rules of courtship, I automatically thought of a certain family that use to be on TV with 19 kids.Sevin rebelled, but when his father died, he had to change his live and get away from his step mom.He moves to Kansas to marry Elle, but falls in love with Evangeline.They couldnât hurt Elle though.Sevin feels, and he think, heâs being punished for all of his sins.I really felt for Sevin, especially the last half of the book.  He is an amazing guy.  Things just didnât work out for him.Or for Evangeline.They truly loved each other.  They planned to be together, but a horrible accident changed everything for them.âI have so much love inside me thatâs all yours, and itâs been trapped inside.  I need to give it to you, because holding it in is killing me.  I know your heart belongs to me.  But Iâm selfish.  I want all of you.  I want your body before you run away from me again.  Because I promise you, once weâre connected, youâre gonna know that we were meant for each other.  Unless you tell me not to, Iâm gonna take you.  Right here.  Right now, Evangeline.âEvangeline punishes herself for her sins with Sevin.I honestly didnât know how things would work out and end up for either of them.This is such a great read!  Itâs been awhile since I was left with a book hangover, and this book left me with one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DKX1LS4POYIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015M1PULU#wasThisHelpful","R1DKX1LS4POYIZ","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book Reviews3.5 StarsI enjoyed the first two books in this series.  I gave them both 4 stars.  This one fell a little flat for me.  The previous books were told in multiple point of views, and it worked for them.  This one had seventeen different charactersâ points of view.  It was a bit much and distracted from the actual story.  We had views from the MC members, the Sheriff, both bands, Dave the manager, Rosie the waitress, and Addy from the hotel.  Just way too many sub stories going on at once.  I actually ended up getting a little bored with the story.  I think it would have been better to have a few novellas to separate the stories.  The writing was very good, it was just too many characters having a say in the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z9GZVNLMXPZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015S5MO5A#wasThisHelpful","R2Z9GZVNLMXPZC","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsI really love this series and think this one is the best book in the series so far.  I was start to get burnt out on MC reads because a lot are so much alike.  This isnât one of those though.  Itâs a series I will continue to read.I knew Lip was keeping something from Cherry, I just didnât know what though.  I was shocked when the truth finally came out.He isnât the only one that has lied though. Cherry has also kept something from him for the past six yearsâ¦Piper.ââ¦dishonesty often looks like the simplest route, getting you out of the path of trouble.  However, that simplicity is a façade, âcause it eventually comes back to bite you in the a**, making you tell lies to cover yourself.  Before you know it, your sins have not only betrayed you but condemned you.âOnce the truths were out, I knew Lip and the club would get Piper for Cherry.  I had no idea how everything would, or if it even could, work out for Lip and Cherry though.Cherry became so much stronger through this book.  She doesnât back down.I love these two characters.  I want more from this series and more of Cherry and Lip.  I canât wait to read the Sin City Outlaws.  Whatâs going to happen between Lip and Zeek?So many questions, I need the next books now!

"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsThis is the second book in this series.  You donât have to read them in order, but I recommend that you do, because the previous couple are also in this book, quite a bit.This is an easy read.  It does take place at the same time as Protecting Shaylee, but there are only a couple scenes that overlap, so it didnât bother me.  Now at the end, the book does jump ahead some.I wish we would have had more of a story after Fate took Aodhagan.This is Laila and Eanâs story.  They are fated, they both know it.  Ean is a rollercoaster though and Laila is basically his booty call.  The sex scenes are hot, but by the end of the book I found myself skimming them.  I would have liked more story than sex for the last few chapters.

"Review from Abibliphobia Anonymous Book Reviews4.5 StarsIâve been wanting a good paranormal book, so when I saw the signups for this series, and read the synopsis, I had to sign up for the tour.  I wasnât disappointed and will definitely continue reading the series.This book is about Fae.  Now it is a little different than other Fae books I have read, which is a very good thing.  I like how they arenât actually like the ânormalâ fae you read about.I did take half a star away because I knew right away who the stalker was.Shaylee has no clue she is half-fae.  Her father told her stories of fairies all the time, before he was killed.  She thought they were just fairy tales.  On her twenty-first birthday, she learns the truth.  Aden tells her.Now Aden has been around her off and on for her entire life.  He was friends with her dad.  Two years ago, things got heated between them and he left.  She hasnât seen him since.I do love the love story between these two.  Shaylee doesnât take his crap.  She gives as good as she gets.  And she doesnât back down, even though Aden is a complete alpha male, complete with caveman like tendencies.I canât wait to read Eanâs story next!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OW08K2LZ2SY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WKRALMS#wasThisHelpful","R2OW08K2LZ2SY1","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsThis is the second book in the Savage Saints MC.  You donât have to read Kick first, but I strongly suggest that you do.  Both Tank and Ivy are also in Kick, so youâll have more of a background on Ivy and why sheâs at Tankâs house detoxing.  Now if youâre looking for a rainbows, unicorns, and butterflies MC read, this isnât for you.  But if youâre looking for a read where both characters are broken.  One so broken you donât know if they can be helped, or pieced back together because of the living h*** theyâve been through, you must read this.Tank is a killer, heâs jerk, a major jerk.  But he honestly does care for, and love, Ivy.  He wants to help her.Ivy is a club girl and a drug addict.  But after learning of her past, itâs understandable.Tank may be jerk, but he has his moments.(I do have a qoute, but you'll have to see it on goodreads or on the blog, sorry)I loved how Carmen Jenner didnât tell us about Tank and Ivyâs past right off the back.  But instead, there were chapters throughout the story.I couldnât put this book down at all.

"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsThis is a good read for the most part.  I did find myself skimming the sex scenes for the second half of the book.  They were a little repetitive to me.  The story line was interesting and I found myself wondering what exactly the prologue had to do with the story, not in a bad way though.I really liked the mystery of the story.  We do get answers, but it does end in a cliffhanger.I liked both Elle and Logan. Both have some issues though.  The fit together well and are good for each other.I will read the next one.

"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsI was hooked on this book from the moment I read the synopsis.  There arenât many books out there about female MMA fighters.  Iâm a huge MMA fan, so if I see one about a female fighter, I have to read it.  Now this story didnât center on MMA fights.  But it showed how much of a fighter Rain is.She started fighting for her life at seventeen.  Well, that was the first time the fight consumed her.She is a complete bad***.  Garrett had been her friend when they were young.  He protected her and kept the bullies away.  That ends when his dad gets stationed elsewhere and they have to move away.Rainâs heart was broken for the first time.After Rain loses her mom, she moves in with her aunt and starts a new school.  Itâs fate, Garrett is there.âAnd when youâre eighteen, Iâm gonna marry you, Rain Noelle, and youâre gonna travel the world with me.  Weâll create our own world.  A place where nothing else matters but us.âBut the Army takes him away again and her aunt dies.  Everyone she loves leaves her.It takes four years before they see each other again.Garrett is an awesome guy.  I love both him and Rain.The feelings are all still there, but they have both changed a lot.I wasnât expecting what happened after the fight to happen.  It hit me out of the blue and I was blindsided by it.I love an ending like that, that I donât see coming from the beginning of the book.This is definitely a book you should read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ARV5CX34CJYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500140872#wasThisHelpful","R2ARV5CX34CJYH","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsThis is book 2.5 in the Brothers of Ink and Steel series.  You should read Dare first, since this is a novella for Josh and Sophie.  I absolutely love Josh even more after reading this.This book starts a few days before Josh, Sophie, and Charlieâs wedding.  You canât forget about Charlie, sheâs so dang adorable.Josh isnât sure if Sophie will go through with the wedding or not.  Sheâs having nightmares of Josh changing and that he will start to treat her like her ex did.  She knows he wonât, but she still has those unwanted thoughts.âI know pain.  I know about forgiveness.  And I know the time it can take to heal a wound you canât see.

"This isn't the only vibrator I own, but it is my new favorite.  I actually like it more than my $90 one.  The quality is great.  IT's 9 speed and water proof.  It's not that loud either.  Now it did take me awhile to get use to the control button being on the very end of the grip.  I accidentally changed the speed and tempo a few times when I wasn't meaning to.  My others have the controls on the side, at the end of the grip, so you don't accidentally change the setting and throw yourself off.  Now I haven't had a chance to try it out with my husband, it's been a solo testing experience.  He's been away at sea, but now that he's home, he's excited to test it out as well.  We just have to get away from our 6 yr old so that we can.  Being waterproof is a must for me, since he's gone so much and it's just me and the kiddo.  Sometimes the shower is the only time I get a  few minutes to myself.  The packaging is very nice on the product.  And it's purple, you can't go wrong with purple.  This is definitely a product I will get continued use out of, especially when his deployment comes around.  I am a huge book nerd, so this comes in handy while reading what my husband refers to as ""mommy porn"".  So it will be getting recommended to fellow military spouse friends, as well as fellow book nerds.  I wouldn't mind reviewing more for this company.  They sell quality products for a reasonable price.I will add more to my review when I'm able to test it out with my husband.I received this item in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTPUV2SX7G3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TD36IR4#wasThisHelpful","RSTPUV2SX7G3Z","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been in the market for a vibrating training collar for a while.  So when I was offered the chance to receive this product in exchange for an honest review, I had to say Heck yes.  I'm very picky on what training devices I will use on my dog.  He is a 26lb rescued mutt, that was abused and beat before he adopted us.  He's my baby, but he does have some issues even though we have had him for 4 years now.  He's a great dog though.  His biggest issues are attacking the vacuum, or grabbing me by my ankles to try to pull me away from the big evil noisey machine.  He also has a tendency to act aggressively when he sees another dog, well, one that he doesn't know, when we go for our daily walks.  I have been putting the collar on him for the walks and when I vacuum.  I have it set on the lowest setting, there are 10 levels for both the sound and the vibrations.  The first time I had it on him, he tried to kill the vacuum, again (yes, he's killed a few of them).  I pressed the button and gave him a little vibration, he went upstairs and laid down in my bed while I finished.  I then took him on a walk, where I knew there would be other dogs.  We live on a bay, in a very dog friendly neighborhood, so people are always walking their dogs by the water.  He still had the collar on.  He didn't growl once, I never had to turn the remote on or anything.  So it's working really well for my dog.  I love how you control when he gets either the tone, or the vibration.  It's not a bark collar.  It doesn't buzz everytime he barks.  I hate those.  You chose when to use it to correct a behavior.  It's working great for us and I'm so very happy with this collar.  I love how it's rechargeable also.  This is a great product.  I don't even have to carry the remote with me.  Just having the collar on him is working now.  I've seen a lot of improvement in the past week.  Don't get me wrong, I've been working with him since we brought him home with us, and he's changed 150% in the past 3 years.  Some of his issues, he will always have, but at least now my poor vacuum will live.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEHR5NG78LH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZI5V8XK#wasThisHelpful","R2MEHR5NG78LH6","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book Reviews.This is the first book by JL Perry that I have read.  I must say, Iâm very impressed and will read more from them.  I loved reading this and had problems putting it down.How can being called a bastard at the age of 5 affect a child?  Youâll see when you read about Carter.If heâs a bastard, he may as well embrace it and act like one as well, right?  And thatâs just what he does.His mom has been all he has for his whole life, but she got married to a total douche.  She didnât see how he treated Carter, and Carter wouldnât tell her.  He had plans to leave as soon as he turned eighteen anyways.But when he moves in with stepdad from hell, he wasnât prepared for the neighbor.Indiana sees right through him.  She slowly crumbles his walls, he canât take it though.  He leaves.This book is broken into two parts.  The second part is five years after he left.Carter is back.  He knows he messed up.  But the feelings are still there and just as strong.  He still doesnât think heâs good enough for Indi though.  Itâs not easy to get her back.And then they go through so much.âI donât just love you, sweetheart.  You own me completely.  Itâs crazy how much.  I never thought anyone could make me feel like this, but f*** me, you do.  You make me feel it all.  I loved you when I walked away five years ago, and Iâve never stopped.  Itâll only ever be you.âCarter is absolutely amazing.  He is thoughtful, caring, loving, kind and the farthest thing from a bastard.  He just doesnât see it.Yes, he may have been born a bastard, but that doesnât define him. It takes a while before he knows that though.And itâs all thanks to Indiana, the stubborn, feisty, âkidâ next door.I love these characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLFPZ3DHT82JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DTSTKG#wasThisHelpful","RLFPZ3DHT82JT","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have a 6 yr old daughter and knew she would love this.  They are great, but they are for an adult size shoe.  The designs are pre-made, so you just peel the strip and stick them.  That's fine and would have worked, but the part that goes on the toe of the shoe is also 1 piece.  We didn't end up using them on her shoes, but she did find another creative use for them.

If you love a smartass, caring, take no crap, odd teenager, you will love this book.This book is filled with mystery, secrets, lies, murder, and oddness (we can't forget about the weirdos). It kept my attention for the entire time and had my mind coming up with different scenarios the entire time. I was actually wrong about all of my ideas, which very rarely happens. I had no clue what would happen next.Prudence, or Pru, Penderhaus lives in the small town of Flintlock. She has just received devastating news...stage 3 cancer. She is an odd girl, a movie buff, a social outcast, awkward, and extremely tall with red hair. She hasn't really done anything in her short seventeen years. Receiving this diagnosis causes her to start living, she wants to leave her mark.Every small town has that one very spooky house. In Flintlock, that house is 17 Marigold Lane. After being bullied and covered in sugary stickyness, Pru decides to knock on the door. She just has to see the inside of that house. In case there is a coffin in the living room. What greets her catches her totally off guard and turns her into a modern day Nancy Drew and a one girl crew of Mystery Incorporated.Cassius Shooster lives at 17 Marigold Lane. One big issue there...No one knows he exists! That is, until Pru put on her big girl, brave panties and knocked on that door. He's been locked inside for his entire life, by his parents.Pru knows what she has to do, teach Cassius how ""to be human"". He's never been outside before, Pru changes that and by doing so, she changes everything and opens up a huge chest of worms that some people in Flintlock buried.Secrets start coming out and mysteries are being solved.""I was learning my town had more secrets stuffed in its closet than a dirty politician.""I really loved how passionate Pru is, and how she stood her ground, even to the Sheriff of Flintlock. She knew she was right and would not back down. What did she have to lose? She's dieing anyways.Her friend Bonnie is a little badass. And by the end of the book, she has a few more to add to her mystery solving team.I will be reading more of this series, when they come out. I'm hooked and I'm a weirdo too. And as Pru says...""Weirdos should stick together.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ32YL0MENKG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PYE968#wasThisHelpful","RZ32YL0MENKG4","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in this series.  You should read Secrets first.  This was an okay read, just like the first one.  I found it predictable.  I knew what Londonâs secret was at the end of the first book, well, what I thought it was, and I was right.  I knew how it would play out with Cain and Cameron for the most part as well.I like unpredictable books.  Iâm not sure if I will try the next one, Iâve tried the first two and they were the same for me.  I felt nothing for any of the characters.  No connection at all.Everything about this was just okay.  Even what happened with Cameron was not a shock or twist for me.I really wanted to read these books after seeing some of the reviews.  A lot of people did love it, so I would give it a try.  It just wasnât for me. I give it a 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WHQM49GKBTCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0IJQXM#wasThisHelpful","R1WHQM49GKBTCO","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an okay read.  Some parts were a little repetitive and some seemed to drag on.  I found most of the book very predictable.  There was only one part I didnât see coming and that was after the accident.  But the author never went any deeper about how, or why.  Why Emily was never told?  It just didnât make sense to me.  Was she really raised by her biological family, or was she adopted?I found the dialogue old in some scenes and in others really immature.  Itâs hard to explain.I felt for what Emily went through, but I had problems connecting to her.  Well, really any of the characters.  I tried, but it just didnât happen for me.I will try the next book, hopefully itâs not as predictable, but I already have an idea of what will happen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RINETYCLHGEJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UE3NDYS#wasThisHelpful","RINETYCLHGEJ1","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Dark Dreams series.  You must read the first one before reading this one.  If you want a hot paranormal read, get these books!Luciana is a vampire, well for the most part.  She is an odd vampire.  Youâll understand what I mean when you read this book.Man does Luciana go through a lot in this book.  Between what is going on with her, she also has Ethan, and Nick, to deal with.  Both basically give her an ultimatum, but donât let her make a decision.I really like both Nick and Ethan, but, I wanted to slap them both for confusing Luciana like they did.âWho am I meant to be with?  Probably no one, Iâm a freak of nature.  Iâm human, vampire, or shifter, quite possibly all three combined.

"A review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsI loved LP Doverâs Gloves off series.  When I saw she was releasing a paranormal book, I signed up for the tour before I even read the synopsis.  She is a must read author for me.  Iâve been wanting a great shifter read and boy did I get exactly what I needed and wanted!  I loved the characters and the storyline.  I loved the Royal shifters storyline, I havenât read about that before.  I canât wait to read more.  Iâm greedy and want each of the characters we met in this book to get a story.  I want Tyla and Colin to be mates!  Iâm excited to get more of these awesome characters!Bailey has been promised to Kade as a mate.  She absolutely hates him and will do anything to stop it from happening.  As he is getting ready to rape her, she has her chance.  She kills him and runs.  She is a rare female alpha.She ends up in Rykerâs territory, they have a history that she doesnât remember.There are a ton of secrets that get revealed.  I hate spoilers, so Iâll leave it at that.People donât want her and Ryker to mate, they have their own plan for her life and their own agenda.âI think about you all the time.  No matter what Iâm doing or where Iâm at, youâre always on my mind.  I donât know if it borders on the line of obsession, but I canât help it.

"I couldnât wait to read this book.  I absolutely love Foster and think I love him even more now after reading his story!  Thanks for making me cry three times while reading this.Lani Lynn Vale is an absolute must read author for me.  As soon as there is a sign up for a new release of hers, Iâm signed up.  No matter what.  I havenât been disappointed with any of her books.You donât have to read these in order, but I highly suggest you do.  Youâll love them, I promise.Foster lost his leg in the previous book.  He has busted his butt to get back on the KDP Swat team though.  If you thought losing a leg changed his life, itâs nothing compared to when a feisty woman came into the police station to yell at him for giving her grandpa a ticket.Blake is the daughter of a cop and her uncle is the chief of police.  She also just divorced a cheating douche, thatâs also a cop.  She doesnât take crap though.  I love her and sheâs perfect for Foster.Foster, damn boy, thatâs all I have to say.âYea. I always f****** want you.  Itâs like a sickness in my brain.  A disease that makes me only think of you and that hot juicy p**** of yours.âThat rose tattoo made me smile.  My husband has one, in the exact same spot, for the exact same reason.I think I want a Macaw now too.  Boris had me laughing so much.âBoom goes the dynamite.âAnd all the other things that bird said.Once again, the little thoughts at the beginning of each chapter where awesome.âWhatâs she have that I donât?  A magic vagina that compliments the size of your micro penis?ââFriendship is like p****** your pants.  Everyone can see it, but only you can feel its warmth.  I want someone to be the p*** in my pants.âThis is a great read.  One minute I was crying, but then the next paragraph would have me laughing.I hated everything Blake went through though.This is one of my favorite series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38IW1KS1X7CA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZP5MX6#wasThisHelpful","R38IW1KS1X7CA0","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsThis is the first book in the Satanâs Fury MC series.  I loved it and think itâs a great start to the series.  There were parts that had me cracking up and some that had me really worried.Maverick goes through a lot at the beginning of the book.  I think he made the right decision when it came to John Warren.  It wasnât an easy decision, but it was the right one.  I would love an update about his relationship with Gavin after everything that happened.Henley witnessed a murder, the cops didnât believe her and now the killers are after her.  Sheâs a loose end that needs taken care of.  Luckily for her, her sister Cassidy is a bartender for Satanâs Fury.  The murder victim was a member.  She is now under their protection.  More specifically, sheâs under Maverickâs watch.I loved the anonymous texts she was sending to Maverick and how they started the prank war.I loved how things developed between them.  It wasnât insta-love.  Well, not an insta-love that they noticed right away.âHenleyâ¦Youâre mine.  I know I havenât been clear about thatâ¦Iâve been too bull headed to admit it out loud, but Iâve known it since the night you were trying to leave the club wearing nothing but that damn t-shirt.  I couldnât stand the thought of you walking out that door.  No one has been able to get to me the way you doâ¦ no one.  I love you Henley.âI canât wait to read the next in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U5JOJ55WX9Q4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RWF1DC#wasThisHelpful","R1U5JOJ55WX9Q4","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review from Abibliophobia Anonymous Book ReviewsThis is the third book in the Kill Devil Hills series.  While each book could be read as a standalone, you really should read them in order because of the continuing story line with Ben.  This book takes place at the same time as the second book.  There are some scnes that overlap, but there arenât many and they arenât long, because the book centers on different characters.Sydney thought she was in love with Ben.  When she was sixteen, she walked into the locker room and caught him having sex with his girlfriend.  It broke her heart.  Worst sixteenth birthday ever!  But that night she met Rhett and got her first kiss.  She still had strong feelings for Ben.  She never tells him and he dies.  Sheâs completely shattered.  Rhett helped take her mind off Ben before, maybe he can do it again.Rhett has always thought aobut Sydney, even if he didnât know her name.  She wasnât legal when they kissed, but itâs been two years and she is now.Rhett wasnât what I was expecting.  I loved how he got nervous, it was cute.  He may have been a manwhore, but he changed.  He is a big sweetie.âSydney, sweetheart, you need to know that Iâm probably always going to be the guy who likes âto f*** and have a good timeâ.  But the difference now, the difference that has been there since our first time togetherâ¦the difference is youâre the only girl I want to be that guy with.  Iâm sorry for doubting you for a minute there.  Sometimes itâs hard to believe a girl like you would ever choose a guy like me.  As much as it might not seem like it, I do have my insecurities.âI love Rhett!But he has a lot to deal with because of Ben.  First itâs competing with the ghost of Ben.  Then the truth about Ben.  Plus Sydneyâs brother absolutely hates Rhett.This is a great series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QK1EPAZOQPFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131LV6KW#wasThisHelpful","R1QK1EPAZOQPFM","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Iron Bulls MC series.  It picks up right where Asunder ends.  It does end in a cliff hanger.  But I love cliff hangers, so it doesn't bother me at all.  After that ending, I need the next book now.  I am so glad Phoenyx Slaughter reached out to me on goodreads.  I'm love the daddy dom/baby girl, it doesn't bother me that Karina is still in high school anymore, she is legal.This book kept my attention the entire time.  It's a fast paced, quick read.  A lot of hot sex.I really like Dante, and Luck.  I want Luck's story tooI am wondering what will happen to Logan when he's finally found though and what other secrets he has.  He didn't tell them all.  I don't think his intentions were bad, but he did go against the MC.  After what was revealed at the ending, if he knew about that, I can understand why he did what he did.That bombshell at the end though.What Romeo said, has all of these thoughts and ideas racing through my head.  I can't wait for the next book to see if any are right.I want to say what my ideas are, but I won't because I would hate to give anything away.I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DZCIVNF1DIFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Q4KK6A#wasThisHelpful","R3DZCIVNF1DIFU","A15EI56DL57DZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15EI56DL57DZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I was unsure about this book.  The age difference didn't bother me.  Dante is thirty-four and Karina is eighteen.  What did get me a bit is that she's still in high school.  I would have liked a litte more dialogue to go along with the hot sex.Dante is the Sargeant-at-Arms of the Iron Bulls MC.  He's never with a girl for more than a week really.  no relationships.  But one night with Karina isn't enough.  The move very fast.  What started as a one night stand turned into her moving in with him.  All his protective instincts come out for her.Karina knew who Dante was when they ""met"".  She wanted to use him to get back at Logan.  Logan broke her heart two years ago.  This is where sh really shows how young she is.These two surprised me and things are working out.  Karina is a natural submissive.This does end with a cliff hanger.  But book two, Disconnect, is out now.

"Took a while to figure out what's wrong with the tool, but finally figured it out.I used the middle-sized tool to attemtp to ""level the deck"" on a 1911 receiver.Setup is everything with milling.  I've had that pounded into my head for years.  Level, level, level.  Tighten clamps and check, level?  Check.  Tighten, check again.  That thing was dead nutz on.Starting running the fly cutter, figured I'd take a shallow 0.0005"" cut to start, and that took of a smidgen of material from about 3/4 the length of the rails.Dropped down to 0.002"" - same thing - but as I got to the full length of the frame, the cutter started to dig into the REAR of the receiver.HOLY CR*P!Put the dial indicator back onto the quill and check the dust cover and it's level, dead nutz on.What happened?  Only thing I can figure out is the fly cutter isn't cut accurately and the built-in runout is just enough that the plane of the cutting bit is off several degrees from perpendicular.I used a square 1/2"" end mill to do the job.  Came out just fine.  Unfortunately, I've owned these too long to return them.Had it occurred to me I would have done a test run on something else first - which I DID, but with a deeper cut on softer material and didn't notice any problem over the 2 inches or so of a cut I made.  The LONGER cut brought the arc of the trailing edge back down below the level of the cut made by the leading edge by about 0.001"".","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G8JTTFWEJ8NE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DD4HV#wasThisHelpful","R1G8JTTFWEJ8NE","A1XB48WXBCHM6N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XB48WXBCHM6N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, when they say ""daylight"" MAN is that bright.  You don't really think much about going to daylight (this bulb is 6000K) from the softer, closer to 3000K yellowish sunlight color of a Xenon/halogen 50W bulb, but it's BRIGHT.  Which can be a good thing, depends on what effect you're looking for.  Chase away shadows or softer mood lighting.I had to return these.  I replaced some cellar stair lighting a few years ago when the 35 year old lamp fittings burned out and I decided to get something smaller, simpler, with more focused, cooler, longer-lasting light and the housings were cheaper as a set from the local big box hdwr store.Here's the thing.  These bulbs are too TALL.  Too LONG.  From the tips of the contacts to the front of the light they measure 2.25"".  A standard, FEIT 50W halogen bulb measures 2.05"" (I used a digital caliper - but for comparison see photos). That quarter inch can make a big difference in your housing, if there's a bezel, a retaining ring, a focusing lens, whatever.Probably, for MOST fittings, this isn't a problem.  But for the lights I have, the lamp retaining ring will NOT seat onto the housing.  Use them anyway?  Tie them together, put them in a zip lock baggie and put the rings away somewhere the next owner will find ten or twenty years down the road?  I'll stick with the halogen bulbs for now.I'd LIKE to be using only 5 watts instead of 50.  I think over the time of the bulbs' lifespan I might recoup the cost of the bulbs.  The lights often stay on most of the day as I and/or my wife work out of our basement offices or are using the exercise equipment.  So two bulbs, ten hours a day, a kilowatt-hour a day vs one tenth of that?  It MIGHT pay for itself to use LED bulbs.If only they fit.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BX9WUCGKEF0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F30OHG0#wasThisHelpful","R1BX9WUCGKEF0C","A1XB48WXBCHM6N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XB48WXBCHM6N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:03 Mins Doesn't work.  Just doesn't.  Followed very simple directions to the letter.  Repeatedly.  I have an ongoing email with nano digital where they're telling me to do exactly what I've already done.  Over and over and over again for two days now.  Directions included [all typographic errors originated with manufacturer/retailer]""Before using the Chip Resetter, please read the instruction carefully.-Refer to Fig.1 or Fig.2, choose the right cartridge holder according to the cartridge you need to be reset (225/226;220/221;-5/-8)- Connet a printer USB cable to the restter and a computer for the power supply. (Fig.3)- Slide in the cartridge along with the holder guide and push the chip side down so that the chip and the resetter pins firmly and well contacted.- The red LED indicator inside of the resetter will blink and until always on.  The chip has been reset.""Except it hasn't been, and doesn't.  Despite repeated attempts to do so, this unit simply does NOT reset the chip.  Printer will not work.  Light flashes green, then stays on solid red.Video shows one cartridge - left, Magenta - which was allowed to run out of ink, then was refilled and ""reset"" and replaced.  Cartridge on right - Cyan - was refilled before running out, replaced, works, but sends signal to printer management software that cartridge is due to be replaced, showing no ink remaining (although it's full).Am awaiting a replacement or refund.Pays your money, takes your chances in the new world disorder free market.Update/addendum 11-07-2015:  Second unit received.  Plugged into USB port, followed (SAME) directions.  ONLY difference is, the red light in the base of the CARTRIDGE lights up solid red as does the LED inside the unit.  Okay.  Plugged cartridge back into printer.  Still shows nearly empty cartridges.  Tried it ONE MORE TIME.  Tricky part is getting BOTH the cartridge AND the resetter to flash and keep the LED on continuously; this requires VERY careful placement, pressure and pushing a small switch in the base of the unit near the chip to get them BOTH on at the same time.  OEM monitoring software NOW shows cartridge is full.So this CAN work.  We'll see for how long.Maybe I got a defective unit the first time, 'cause I can't for the life of me get it to work.

"**SPOILER ALERTS**  Like so many comic books (ahem, ""Graphic Novels"" for my geekazoid friends) being brought to the big screen, the themes are often larger than the budget.  This didn't seem to be the case here, as the scale/scope of the story, the beasts brought to life were ginormous but didn't overwhelm the story.  The little homage element to ""Dead Like Me"" ( a theme from earlier in our common European ancestry of Halloween being the day the dead show their true faces) of seeing the characters' duel presence (""Roy"" looking like someone off the cover of a glossy fashion magazine in a grocer's checkout lane) was clever, used to good effect.  The amount of gold rounded up, and by whom, and over how much time could have been good backstory.  Overall I liked it, it was a useful diversion from Fall 2015s, debates, emails, ISIS, all that.

"During my years of medical training and many years since, I learned that the marriage bed should be for two things: sleep and sex.This mattress is good for half of that.  We've owned this mattress for almost a year and are looking for another one.  Another brand.  We spent several days, afternoons, evenings shopping around the various mattress stores in the area and dealing with salesmen, CRAZY prices (how many thousand dollars do you have to spend to even get CLOSE to guaranteeing a comfortable night's sleep?  Two thousand?  Five thousand?  And no guarantees), we read many online sources and many more reviews and figured hey, for $400 (roughly), we could be sports and give the Brentwood home mattress a try.Both my wife and I get a very good night's sleep on this mattress, and upon waking, find it VERY easy to roll off the bed - as the edges provide so little support they compress and practically POUR you out onto the floor.Similarly, during sex it is ALSO very easy to roll off the bed, anywhere other than dead center in the mattress and you feel like you're going to fall.  Diagonally is somewhere better, cross-wise, necessary.Lately, too, I find that trying to sit up in bed to read (I know, I know, that's NOT what the marriage bed is for, but it's a life-long habit I find much harder to break than writing amazon.com reviews) is harder as the very spot my center of mass lies is sinking.  Yeah, I've turned the mattress around - more than a few times - but it's no good.  It's sinking, and becoming more of an annoyance as time goes by.Now, double up that weight during sex and you sink even farther; there's just too much ""give"" to the materials that make up this mattress and it's wearing down faster the longer we own it.  We're not really heavy people, maybe 10% over ideal body mass, but fit, and frisky, and this isn't a mattress for ""active"" people.I don't recommend it.  Might talk with the manufacturer, but really thinking it's got to go.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABHIFQ8ZN453/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJZ18PS#wasThisHelpful","R3ABHIFQ8ZN453","A1XB48WXBCHM6N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XB48WXBCHM6N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Simple Green cleaner for as long as I can remember... well, since I first became aware of it as a cleaning product sold through ""The Price Club"" when I lived in San Diego 30 years ago.  A friend of mine used it, I tried it, I liked it, it works.  I especially like the fragrance.  Not as harsh a ""chemical smell"" as ammonia (which cleans almost everything) or bleach (which cleans almost everything else - if you really want to clean EVERYTHING else, there's steam), but a pleasant almost candy-like scent.  I can adjust the strength, diluting it even more for general all-around cleanup and it cuts through dog slobber, bathroom floor ""drizzle"" and kitchen counter crud equally as well.  I'm not a clean freak, far from it.  But when I do clean I want something that works.

"Bought this for an upgrade for my son's 4 year old macbook pro - late 2011 - a college present.  I admit I scrimped a bit on the RAM, opting for 4 GB instead of the extra $500 or whatever for the full 16 GB the processor/logic board could handle, and only got a 500 GB drive.  He had the logic board replaced recently due to a recall on a video failure - which happened to him during finals week - and, although he was able to get the files off the hard drive he needed for projects/reports/presentations, it was up to me to take it into the Apple store for troubleshooting and repair.  No charge.  Apple fixed the logic board.  But the battery was fading fast, and the original hard drive was SLOW.  so I blew ABout $250 and bought this drive, 16 GB of RAM and a new battery pack.  First I changed out the RAM and battery and rebooted.  STILL slow.  Then I replaced the hard drive, copied the almost 400 GB of data off the backup drive (well, I let the software do it, went to work, and 12 hours later it was done).  Rebooted the computer, and it's ALMOST as fast as my own 2015 Macbook pro with approximately the same hard drive (hybrid).  Ran it through some paces and it's ready for graduate school and then some.  Overall I think this will be a good investment, as have all the other WD drives I've bought in the past.  I've had bad luck with Hitachi and Seagate and so far so good, no problems with WD drives in any of my backup units.  YMMV but it's worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18JG29M4VQPUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3UBY4#wasThisHelpful","R18JG29M4VQPUC","A1XB48WXBCHM6N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XB48WXBCHM6N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, let me say this: I've tried other non-OEM cables and it's been difficult getting them to work with iPhones/iMacs/MacBooks - consistently that is.  Just recently my daughter took her macbook pro and iPhone 5S to the genius bar because it had stopped synching/backing up her data after she updated from a 4S.  It was the cable.  Non-OEM.  Thing is, it's what CAME with her iPhone.  Or so we thought, then we tried the one she kept in her CAR and that one worked.  Well, there went another $22 at the Apple store for another, NEW, OEM cable.

"I like this stuff so much I buy it in bulk, probably have a dozen sticks in the storeroom.Seems like once you find something you like these days the manufacturer stops making it so it's good to stock up.I'd tried rub-on deodorants years ago, but the kinds with the aluminum salts and baking soda- or maybe it was the parabens or other preservatives - gave me a rash under both arms (so I knew it was contact dermatitis, just not sure to what).So I gave this a try.  Reading the label, I was glad I remembered as much of my organic chemistry as I did (high school and 3 quarters of university then molecular biology and a little more) as most all of the stuff listed is fairly benign (unless ingested): glycols, stearate (from tallow, beef fat), som plant/flower extracts (that's the most fun thing I learned about as an undergrad, is the variety of toxins and mutagens and carcinogens we get from plants.  Those plants have been trying to kill us off since we were single-celled organisms in the primordial oceans and they haven't stopped trying.  Vegetarians don't get cancer?  Tell me another one), the only ting I'm not really crazy about is EDTA but, like I said, ""unless ingested"" and ""Triclosan.""  Triclosan is a fairly ubiquitous antiseptic to which CA-MRSA and several other skin-colonizing pathogens (vs. normal flora) are becoming immune - or so I've read, but the reports are contentious.

"This will take some getting used to.One, it's smaller, lighter and narrower, easier to hold than my old mug.Two, coffee stays HOT for a LONG time.I usually make a cup of coffee in late afternoon when I'm working (my shifts run from 8 AM to 9 PM or until everyone's out of the clinic, 10PM isn't unusual), say, around 4 PM and drink it down by 5 PM or so.Last night - the first day I had the mug - I made a cup of coffee around 4 PM and by 8 PM hadn't drunk it yet, not that I didn't want to, I COULDN'T, as it was too HOT to sip much less guzzle.In the photo is a what I've thought of as a very nice travel mug, a gift from my daughter about 5 years ago.  If I don't finish my coffee in the first two hours, it may as well be an iced latte it's so cold.  The top leaks.  I've knocked it over a dozen times or more and it ALWAYS leaks.  On my desk calendar, on receipts, records, you name it.  Embarrassing.  It also has this special feature where you take a drink, and as the coffee sloshes back into the bottom it splashes UP and out of the hole all over your face, neck, shirt/tie.  Not every time, but every so often, SURPRISE!  It's also just wide enough that once stuck in the cup holder of my car, occasionally I'll go to pull it out and the cup holder insert will come with it - despite my having put double-sided sticky tape on the outside/bottom of the cup holder so it'll say put.  It doesn't.  But it WAS a gift.  A thoughtful one. My daughter's like that.  It's with great pain that I'm putting it in the recycling bin.As things go, maybe that's a good thing.  Maybe the steel that went into the cup on the left will go into making another one like the Zojirushi mug in the middle.  Meanwhile, as I write this, take a picture, upload it then submit my review, the coffee in the cup on the right has cooled.I wonder if they make a cup like THAT?You can't go wrong with Zojirushi.  I own a fuzzy logic rice cooker - large - and got one for my son when he got his first apartment.  They make great stuff.  Buy with confidence.Oh, and by the way, this isn't a trick question.  In the photo, which mug holds the most fluid?  The stainless steel one on the left or the black one in the middle?Actually, the same.  About one and a half times as much as the mug on the right.  Smaller, lighter, better.  That's Japanese engineering in a nutshell.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T3LYKTN2G15C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYOGTTG#wasThisHelpful","R1T3LYKTN2G15C","A1XB48WXBCHM6N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XB48WXBCHM6N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a physician, I'm occasionally asked about probiotics.  I think they're a great idea.  I have for decades.  Modern medicine - modern allopathic western medicine - is finally coming around to understanding the relationship between the complex human micro biome (the species and kinds of bacteria that inhabit the surface of our bodies - SURFACE.  The skin and gut are contiguous.  Think about that.) and the health and functioning of other organ systems.In 2015 we know there is a relationship between gut bacteria and:Acne.  Asthma.  Diabetes.  Hypertension.  Hypercholesterolemia.  Mood disorders.  And more.From the time we are born and the nursing staff whisk away from our mother's arms to wipe us down, clean us up, a clock is ticking to establish normal colonies of gut bacteria.  Every time we suckle at our mother's breast, or are handed a pacifier that fell on the floor (5 second rule - or it was in OUR home.  But doesn't matter - look into the Swiss or Amish allergy ""paradoxes"" sometime.), bacteria enter our gut where they may or may not establish colonies of little baby bacteria, depending on how that particular strain competes with all the rest of them there.And every time you take your child to a well-intentioned but poorly-educated physician, nurse practitioner or physician's assistant for a head cold and you come away with a prescription for yet another generally unnecessary antibiotic, your child's gut bacteria population is affected.  More often than not for the worse, as we're learning that kids who use antibiotics earlier in life wind up needing more antibiotics later in life.2 year olds don't get ""sinus infections.""  They don't have ""sinuses"" as we think of them.  They get purulent rhinitis, which is NORMAL immune functioning and is transient.  Give 'em an antibiotic and you wipe out some of the normal population of bacteria in the sinuses which INHIBIT the growth of the ""bad actors"" which can make them sicker later on.C. difficile colitis is arguably an overgrowth of NORMAL bacteria (approx. 12% of the population has the organism present in their gut) and is rapidly becoming one of the more worrisome of iatrogenic (physician-caused) illnesses.  Sure, we can treat it with a ""poop transplant"" (heterologous stool transplant), maybe, we're not there yet.Allergists and Dermatologists are recognizing the relationship between healthy gut bacteria populations and a normally functioning immune system and healthy skin.Some gastrointestinal disorders like ""Irritable Bowel"" can be helped with probiotics.  So too can inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.But it's not science... not yet fully recognized, not fully quantifiable.But it's getting there.So what do I tell my patients, especially the ones I prescribe an antibiotic to for conditions for which an antibiotic is clearly indicated?  Find a brand, even a store brand, with the most DIFFERENT species of bacteria listed on the label.  If all it says is ""Lactobacillis acidophilus,"" go to the next bottle.  Look for five or more species of Lactobacilli, and a handful of others.  You don't have to buy the most expensive product on the market, just the most diverse, because you're trying to replace a VERY diverse bacterial population in your gut and establish ""healthier"" organisms.Think of it as ""gentrification.""  Chasing out a homogenous criminal urban populations with a wealthier,  diverse, caring population which will turn around the culture of the section of town as they move in and take over one home, one shop, at a time.  They clear out the dregs of society, the filth, the graffiti, fix the broken windows, put flower boxes outside their windows and on the curbs, pick up the trash, making the neighborhood a safer, healthier place for everyone.I like this product.  It meets my personal criteria and the price is right.  Sure, you might be able to buy ""better,"" but again, there's no real ""consensus"" yet in the medical community on this issue, so the idea that doing SOMETHING is better than doing NOTHING may hold sway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZXSIUFFX76Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KIM3QY#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZXSIUFFX76Z","A1XB48WXBCHM6N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XB48WXBCHM6N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd give it 5 stars - it's makers earned it - except for the cap.  The cap seals really well.  It's also hard to get open and to close.  We can send a man to the moon but we can't make seals for after shave balm that are end-user friendly?  I'm thinking something like the top of an Elmer's/wood glue bottle would be ideal.  I like this stuff.  After I'd gotten back to wet shaving I tried several after shave balms and settled on Kanwa by Feather (I use a Feather Stainless DE razor too) but it's been discontinued.  Go figure, Japan's economy is in the toilet and one of their best export products is no longer available.  So digging around Amazon one night I found Baxter's of California After Shave Balm and figured, well, I'll give it a try.I'm glad I did.  It doesn't take much to cover my face, much less than the Kanwa I was using even though it's a slightly thicker/more viscous product it distributes more evenly, doesn't leave a sticky residue, seeming to work into the skin leaving a smooth, just skin feel.The scent is very mild, not at all obnoxious (Kanwa doesn't smell like anything), a light herbal air to it which doesn't linger.I'm buying another couple of tubes.  Maybe a couple gallons, in case Baxter's suddenly disappears too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343A4U7P5G1HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006B4VVW#wasThisHelpful","R343A4U7P5G1HB","A1XB48WXBCHM6N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XB48WXBCHM6N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed watching this so much a few weeks back, I watched it again a few days ago.  I didn't buy the Blu-ray, not yet, but I may in a few months when I can get it cheaper through Amazon or some other reseller - meanwhile, watching it twice in a few weeks' time is enough for now.Enough to ask one question: for a man who once killed 3 men with only a f**king pencil, what takes him to long to realize he has a backup pistol in his belt behind his back while he and the Russian punk kid's older brother are hashing it out in the club?  Did the fifteen foot drop off the balcony pound some sense into him?I found it fun, intense, really wished the directors had gone into a little more detail about his background, done a little more character development (like what's that private little hit-man's club all about anyway? Is this what Martin Blank's nemesis played by Dan Ackroyd - Grosse Pointe Blank - had in mind in a parallel comic-book minded universe?),they could have given us more of a glimpse into the characters played by John Leguizamo, for example.  There's DEPTH there, briefly flashed upon when he grabs the gun being held to his head and says go ahead and shoot without a scintilla of fear.  Who IS this guy and who owns him that he's that fearless in the face of imminent death?  And he hits Viggo's kid and answers to Viggo in a tone like he simply said ""hey you, get off my lawn"" when Viggo could end him in very unpleasant ways, but doesn't.There are layers upon layers of background, of RESPECT, of rules, a finely crafted code of honor among thieves (killers, dealers, power brokers) one wishes existed in our very own US Congress.  Everything looks very finely polished from the outside and the chaos within is managed by contracts, permissions, RULES, honorable men.  VERY unlike our US Congress (chaos on the outside, God knows what behind closed doors - or maybe it's the same thing and I'm reaching here for allegory that doesn't exist).The choreography in the home invasion scenes were amazing.  Very detailed but could have been a little better.  I thought they were too choreographed where real CQB (and HTH) fighting is uglier, MUCH FASTER and chaotic (having been in more than a handful of bar fights and brawls in my somewhat misspent youth and surviving one home invasion) but (kudos to the director here) not entirely one-sided as John really has to struggle in a few places, but hey, wait a second... night vision gear (especially the cheap Russian stuff) is available just about everywhere and cutting the power before a hit like this isn't just for NAVDEVGRU or other SPECOPS forces anymore.  Just how stupid ARE the Russian ""mafia"" contract killers anyway?  Don't they know their target is (DUN-Dun-dun...)  JOHN WICK?  And he JUST might have a pencil or two lying around?Every time I make ""dinner reservations"" in the future I'm going to laugh, at least inwardly.My favorite scene so far?  The guy who played the brother in ""Rescue Me"" the one from the ""Mayhem"" insurance commercials, playing Viggo's ""consigliere"" getting capped.  If only more lawyers could wind up like that...It's a rare action film I find wishing it had been longer, but I could have watched another 30 minutes of John Wick, easily.I'm really looking forward to a sequel (prequel?).  Lot of undiscovered territory there.

"Everything about Ebola from about twenty years ago and why pretty much nothing has changed.A good read.  A terrifying one.  A must read.  Written over 20 years ago, this book was prophetic in some ways and details the work of the people at ground zero of the Ebola outbreaks in East Africa in the 1970s, the outbreak in Reston Virginia, and clarifies, for me, the dichotomy between how the primary researchers working on Ebola at USARIID at Ft. Dietrich, Maryland would like us to respond to an outbreak and how the CDC refuses to take such extreme measures as is necessary to prevent this agent from becoming epidemic in the US.The cultures of the two organizations come from two different experiential circumstances.  You'll have to read the book to truly understand that our government's response to the threat presented by this virus is being led by political people with a medical background (indeed, Tom Friedan has't renewed his medical license but he's director of the CDC), not medical people who are in uniform or working for politicians.  Dr. Fauci is primarily responsible for the HIV/AIDS ""epidemic"" in the 1980s by not insisting CDC's guidelines to close the bathhouses and glory holes allowed its rapid spread through the homosexual community coast to coast.  He seems to be applying the same politically correct attitudes and platitudes to Ebola today, placing our country - and the world - at risk of great peril.A truly remarkable book, this reads well, quickly, with a minimum of medical/scientific ""jargon"" (there's a glossary in the back).I found reading it again, 20 years after I first did, with many more years' exposure and experience in CBRNE, Medical community response to catastrophic events, medical planning for same, infectious disease medicine and direct exposure to ""political medicine"" working in government healthcare in the National Capitol Area, Preston perfectly exposes and encapsulates the aforementioned dichotomy and political enmity between CDC and military medicine.Last Spring, WHO was aware of Ebola breaking out in West Africa and, by their own admission, dropped the ball.CDC's Friedan tells us ""we'll control this outbreak like we did every other one in the past twenty years"", except this one, and he said that after five countries had outbreaks and individuals in Spain, the US and a few other countries tested positive or were already in quarrantine.Doctors without borders has had over half their medical staff infected.  16 our of 29 physicians have died.  Fully ten percent of all healthcare workers involved in the outbreak have been infected.If Ebola is SO hard to catch, why are so many people catching it?The agencies are withholding information.CDC tried blaming the nurses when CDC/WHO PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) protocols failed.Ebola IS airborne (it's in the book - this has been known for decades), it persists (lives) on surfaces for days if not weeks (as do MANY other enteroviruses) and yes, you CAN get it from an asymptomatic patient (Polio, another enterovirus, is documented as shedding from upwards of 90% of infected, asymptomatic, individuals).There is SO much ""wrong"" with our government's response to the Ebola outbreaks, the roots of much of it can be seen in how Preston details the interactions between CDC and military medical experts.It's too bad this was never made into the movie it should have been.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNQ7KL3MPWWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007DCU4IQ#wasThisHelpful","R1LNQ7KL3MPWWV","A1XB48WXBCHM6N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XB48WXBCHM6N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Somewhere, sometime, someone got the idea in their head that aloe must be so good they decided to add it to every skin lotion and cream on the market.  Like the old joke about prozac being so good for everyone the APA wanted to put it in the water supply but since so much of it - and other SSRIs - have been prescribed, it's in the water supply already.So someone, somewhere in pharmaceutical manufacturing land at a meeting decided, ""Hey, they have aloe, we better add it to OUR stuff TOO.""You know what?  Some people are ALLERGIC to aloe.Ever hear about poison ivy?  That chemical in poison ivy, oak, sumac (and mango sap - including the peels), urushiol, is in a LOT of other plants too, and there are various congeners that do the same thing.  Stuff causes contact dermatitis in people sensitive to it.Aloe can and does too, SOMEthing in it can cause allergic contact dermatitis (I'm a doctor but I don't pay for premium content on the allergy speciality websites, I don't know the specific chemical compound sensitizer in Aloe - I'll have to ask my allergist sometime).  It's not for everyone.  Cinnamon is good on toast, but some people are allergic to it.  Plant-based medicine is like that.  Problem is, the people who make lotions, creams, skin care products, all seem to think aloe is for everybody.THIS company gets it.  There's no aloe in it.

"not always for the better.Definitely not the Premium Ham I recalled from my youth.I grew up in a poor southern household, actually went to high school barefoot through many times - my friends and probably the teachers thought I was just a hippie.  Owned two pairs of pants over the same time, wore hand-me down oversize shirts from my brothers.  Very poor, but my mom always made sure we were fed.So I remember buying these when they were like 79 cents on sale at the A&P or Kresge's 5&10 store so my mom could make Schunks (a Bohmeian-slovak family dish with noodles, cabbage and ham - seasonings I never learned) and sandwiches with 2 day-old white bread and mayo.

I really have no idea what shampoo/conditioner I should be using, but all the brands I've been using up until now have been drying my scalp very badly.

Decided to just get all of them and do a trial and error process. I've only used the Almond oil so far and it's definitely been helpful.The dandruff was taken care of from the itching I did due to the dry scalp. My hair has stopped getting oily! However, it is still itchy. I noticed that it works up to 48 hours really well. After that my old symptoms slowly come back up. Not having the oily hair though has been very great, my hair really feels clean and smooth.

"I bought mine from Best Buy but I had to write this review because Amazon allowed biased CoD fans write 1 star reviews for some reason. Please disregard the 1 star reviews that are obviously from CoD fans that are upset Fallout 4 was more hyped as game of the year than CoD. Other than Amazon, various sites have 4.5 out of 5 or 9.5 out of 10 ratings so far from critics and users.This game is very big, huge map and lots of exploring to do. I've been playing about 10 hours now and I'm only level 8 but I'm also slow since I explore everything. I got the PS4 version while my boyfriend got the PC version. We both think PS4 looks and plays better. That's just our opinion though. I'm a girl and I love playing games but I suck at shooting games so I was really happy Fallout 4 had a ""very easy"" setting.Graphics were great, didn't encounter any major bugs yet, had one minor bug where a character didn't talk for a few seconds and was awkwardly paused but it only lasted 5 seconds. I like the story line, it got pretty crazy from the start. This was my first Fallout game. Haven't had lags either and the fps was awesome. I've played so many PS4 games this year and I really think Fallout 4 is my favorite so far.Some helpful tips...1. You can have 1 companion but there are 8 to 10 (not sure of exact #) available throughout the game and you can trade when you encounter them. Each companion gives different perks whether its extra resistance, damage, etc.2. You can have relations *wink* with some of the characters if you reach max affinity with them. Luck and Charm is useful here.3. Your companion won't die but they get injured during battle and won't move. You can either use stimpacks to heal them or wait until battle ends. They heal completely when not in battle.4. Luck is one of the best perks ever, you have to invest your points in it. It will help you a lot throughout the game.5. Explore unmarked areas in the map too for secrets and loot and other special things.6. Save all the loot you pick up, it will be useful for building and mods. The more the better.I got the disc instead of digital code and I'm glad I did b/c it came with a cool poster. I like the game a lot but I heard the DLC's are also great in Fallout so I'm getting the season pass as well. I think Fallout 4 lives up to the hype. Writing this review makes me want to go play again but I have a test tomorrow so I need to sleep *sigh*.

"I really like this side table. For $20-$30 bucks, this is a great table. I use this next to my couch to hold my remote controls and magazines as well as food and drinks. I keep losing the remotes after using it but now that problem is solved. I love the little drawer it comes with, I put my magazines in it and it fits perfectly. The drawer is 12 by 12. The table comes up to my knee (I'm 5'3). I think it's a great size for holding small stuff.The assembling took all of 30 minutes, came with a 2 page instruction book and pictures. It was all very simple and easy, except when you get to the top part, you have to turn the slab upside down to put in the nails you later ""lock"" which gets confusing but other than that it's all straightforward.

"This is a wonderful product I'm thrilled to have found it. As much as I love perfect skin I hate doing the skin care routine it gets really tiring sometimes. Especially when I am in a hurry to put on make up and I have to do all of my skin care stuff first. This cream basically combines the sunscreen and primer step and brightens as well. So you just use your toner and apply this and go straight to your makeup or moisturizer! If you have problem skin then use another primer on top of the conditioning cream for better coverage. My make up went on so much smoother and my pores were less visible because of the better coverage I got with my BB cream (foundation replacement). What I like the most about this cream is that my skin looks more moist and glowly after I apply my makeup rather than matte and dry. I actually don't like the matte finish and prefer a more glowly natural finish. The whitening part in this cream also covers my blemishes much better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1308B4QEQ79O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3ZNQXC#wasThisHelpful","R1308B4QEQ79O4","A24BFJI03MM1P6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24BFJI03MM1P6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've tried tons of different chapstick brands and none of them worked as well as Vaseline at night but I wanted something to wear during the day and Vaseline was way too thick and greasy for everyday use. This dual chapstick solves all of that by being simple and easy to use, odorless, smooth, and actually works for dry/chapped lips. I love that there's spf for the day one. I've used it as a lip primer before I put on lipstick or lipgloss and I no longer have chapped lips afterwards. It doesn't affect my lipstick either so I really recommend using as lip primer for the ladies. I love using the night one overnight because my lips get healed and moisturized while I sleep.

"We don't use a lot of canned goods, but my husband recently started making salsa for himself using canned tomatoes. After listening to him complain for a couple of weeks about his repeated struggles with our aging temperamental can opener, I decided to make the leap and get a new one. I carefully researched reviews on Amazon, Consumer Reports, and elsewhere before settling on this one, that had uniformly high ratings from users. I am glad I did, as the operation is smooth, quiet, it is tall enough for about any can size, and the magnet grabs the can lid every time. The magnet folds itself to the body of the can opener when not in use, which keeps the magnet strong. Very happy with this purchase and expect to get many years of use from it.

"I never watched this much when it was on, but have found that it actually is (in my opinion) the best of the Star Trek series. It is much better acted than the other two, and has the best most insightful well written scripts. The first Star Trek was groundbreaking so it didn't matter that the acting was awful, and the special effects pretty hokey, and Next Generation was swashbuckling, with still silly uniforms. This one has uniforms that someone could actually work and be comfortable in, so is much more believable. The scripts are surprising deep. One recent episode I watched wrestled with the meaning of life itself, beliefs about the afterlife, and how those beliefs color our view of who we are in the universe.

"I have owned horses for 35 years. I have used bute less pellets on and off over that time for temporary issues, but have been using these Bute-Less Pellets for several months for a filly that suffered an injury to her pastern when she was 2 yrs old. Her pastern would swell when it rained and there was mud. She would also rest it considerably more than the other side. Since being on Bute-Less pellets the pastern no longer swells when it is muddy, and although she still rests it somewhat more than the other side, it is not as much and she usually stands square on it. She runs, bucks, and plays, and has not taken a lame step under saddle. Devil's claw has a long history as an excellent anti inflammatory and analgesic, as does yucca. The combination is excellent. The other B-L Pellets also have devil's claw and yucca, but costs about $5 more for the same amount. I therefore switched to this product because it has the same ingredients for a lower cost. Either one of them have the advantage that unlike bute, it will not tear up the intestinal tract, and so is suitable for long term use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIFIWWNDSLQGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IF7CQ34#wasThisHelpful","RIFIWWNDSLQGY","A1B9NN07CYYFQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B9NN07CYYFQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this from another site because it was out of stock on Amazon at the time. It is about to go into the give away box, rather than have it take up space sitting on the shelf, which is where it would stay at my house. It was disappointing to me because the Udi's gluten free bagels are smaller in thickness than the usual bagels, so the bagels slide around in the holder, that is, it does not do what I bought it for, which is to hold the bagel steady for cutting. There is no adjustment for the thickness of the bagel, although that seems to be a failing of most of the bagel holder/slicers. I am back here looking for a different one that will adjust to hold the bagel steady for cutting, doesn't take up counter space and will fit in a drawer, and won't scrap the sesame seeds off the bagel while it is being cut.

"Set in the slims of Havana, Reiner and Yosvani are good friends who find themselves attracted to each other.  This is a surprise to both, since Reiner (a promising amateur soccer player) is married and has a child, while Yosvani is engaged to a girl and works for her loanshark father.  Reiner supports his wife, child and her mother by selling sexual favors to older men, although he doesn't consider himself to be gay. Secrecy, shame, fear of violence and a gambling addiction all add to their problems, as they try to support each other, even as they are constantly pulled apart.Not exactly an original concept for a film, but the difference here is that it is done well, with actors (both the couple and supporting players) who show real emotion and make the most of the storyline. Simulated sexual activity would equal a heavy R rating.

"New Orleans private investigator Micky Knight is back.  While having a late pizza dinner, she happens to meet a group of federal investigators reportedly looking into human trafficking in the area, and Micky agrees to be hired to assist them.  She immediately hits it off with one member of that team, Ashley, and they begin a slow but steady flirtation as they work together.  It is a frustrating engagement for Micky, because she is only given details of the case on a need-to-know basis, and gets into dangerous situations she otherwise may have been able to avoid.  She is also being shadowed by Emily, an FBI agent who likewise seems to have an interest in Micky.  During her work for Ashley, Micky also comes into contact with a local madam, who hires Micky to provide some security for her âgirls,â and may have connections that can be valuable in finding the traffickers.While I have read a couple of earlier books in this series, it doesnât affect my review of this book.  To some extent, it is a credit to the author that some of her fans are so deeply involved in her books that they feel they know better than the author about what the characters should be feeling and doing.  Obviously, they are losing sight of the fact that each should be reviewed on its own merits â¦ the plot, the quality of the writing, how realistic and plausible it could be, etc.  On that level, I canât fault the book at all, and, as a fan of good mystery novels, enjoyed it immensely.

"Quintin Pearson is a gay American living in London, who loses himself in his work as a copywriter, trying to recover from the sudden disappearance of a relationship he thought would last forever.  An invitation to a reception for the American ambassador becomes a life-changing evening, when the ambassador is murdered, and Quintin meets a mysterious Italian man who seems to somehow be connected to the crime.  Subsequent events see Quintin traveling to Belgium to rendezvous with Luca, the man he met at the reception, and to whom he is feeling a definite mutual attraction.  Quintin finds himself working with intelligence agents trying to solve the murder of the ambassador, and perhaps preventing another death already planned.I found the novel to be a definite page-turner of a mystery, well-written and exciting.

"The mystery and lure of the sea is the central emphasis in eleven short stories, by well-known gay authors such as Jeff Mann, Joel Lane, Alex Jeffers and Nathan Burgoine, as well as some newer voices in gay fiction.  From mermen to pirates, from whaling to Greek myths, from sea monsters to âliving islands,â and fighting adversity in the name of love, this anthology has something for pretty much everyone.The style of writing varies with the author, and some are easier to get into than others.  I only had to pass on finishing two of them, and enjoyed the rest to varying degrees.  Probably my favorites were âThe Bloated Womanâ by Jonathan Harper and  âNight of the Sea Beastâ by Brandon Cracraft, both relative newcomers to the subgenre of speculative gay fiction. The âvoicesâ of the sea can be as varied as the authors telling the tales.  Interesting read.

"Nino Santos is your stereotypical sassy, waxed-smooth, shallow, gay muscle twink, who works as a model internationally, and plays at his home in Provincetown.  He is very particular about the kind of men that interest him, mostly clones of himself, which he never lets get too close, spend the night or even date a second time.  Thatâs why he was shocked to wake up with a hangover, and find a hairy, somewhat chubby guy in his bed, who similarly had no idea how he got there.Over the coming week, as Nino tries to find out what led to that memorable morning, he keeps running into Teddy, the guy in question, as some of his friends have seemed to hook up with the otherâs friends in the interim.  Teddy is initially as displeased with Nino as Nino is with him, not on the physical level, but disliking his âplasticâ persona and intolerance for anyone with a different view on life and love.  Fate seems to be intent on bringing them together, again and again, despite their efforts to avoid each other, and they eventually come to see each other â and themselves â in a different light.This is an amusing and spot-on look at the unfortunate discord between two different subgenres in the gay male community (of which, twinks VS bears is just one, with others based on age, race and other incidental factors).  The author also provides a variety of diverse and colorful secondary characters, which add greatly to the enjoyment of the story.  Some erotic content, which I did not find to be excessive for the story.  A well-written, relatable story, which is apparently the third in a âProvincetownâ series, but each title can be read independently.

"Austin TX private investigator Greg Honey reminds me of a gay version of the outwardly smart and suave (but barely in control in his personal life) character in TVâs âThe Rockford Files.â  He struggles to pay his office rent, despite coming from a rich society family who disapproves of his chosen profession as well as his lifestyle.  He has lots of colorful friends who sometimes help him with his work, including BFF Willa, who seems to have a passion for three things:  talking, handguns, and men that are no good for her.  Greg is currently in lust with a young, local actor whom he is sure doesnât feel the same way.Things start to look good, when Greg quickly gets two new jobs:  finding an older gay manâs missing brother, and working an insurance claim for another friend.  Unfortunately, things rarely go smoothly for him, and he finds himself contending with a stalker who breaks into his home and leaves him threatening messages.  Meanwhile, Greg gets forced by his mother to attend a society function at her home, which turns out to be infiltrated by gangsters involved in one of Gregâs cases.Strict mystery buffs may recoil a bit at the over-the-top antics included in this humorous novel, but it kept me interested (and laughing) enough to see it to the end.  Not a lot of substance, and I wonât necessarily be looking for further books in this series, but it was absolutely entertaining and fun to read.

"Chicago police detective Paul Turner is the gay father of two teenage boys.  He lives with his life partner, Ben Vargas, who owns an auto repair shop, but spends most of his time with his longtime squad partner, the irascible Detective Buck Fenwick.  At the start of this book (the 11th in this series), Paul and Buck are investigating the murder of a Catholic bishop, whose body was found on a riverbank in a seedy section of Chicago.  They learn that the bishop was apparently gay â an open secret among many of the local clergy - and even had a penthouse pad he shared with his lover, who was far from cooperative in their investigation.  Looking further, they find a disturbing pattern that includes paying local young men for sex, investigations the Bishop made into possible fraud committed by other church officials, plus a big guy who seems to show up right before them at every scene, all of which seem like likely clues to the mystery of who killed him, and why.I have been a fan of Zubroâs mysteries for many years, and am thrilled he is back creating new titles in both this and the âTom and Scottâ series.  He is a master storyteller, who carefully balances a great mystery with diverse and colorful characterizations, wit and frequent peeks into the charactersâ personal lives.

"In the small Illinois town of Applewood, Molly owns the bakeshop, humorously called âFlour Childâ, which she started with her father, now in a nursing home.  Her dad and the shop are pretty much her life, since Molly is still hurting by the death of her partner, Cassie, four years earlier.  She keeps in touch with Cassieâs parents, who are very fond of her as well, and share their joy when Cassieâs younger sister, Jordan, comes home from California, where she worked in the entertainment industry.  Jordan and Molly start to spend some time together, and an attraction develops that initially bothers both of them as unwise, since Jordan was kind of a sister-in-law to her.  Her growing feelings for Molly distract her a bit from her need to make the barely-profitable bakeshop able to pay off the upcoming mortgage.âSweetâ is definitely the keyword for this well-written, character-driven lesbian romance novel.  It is ultimately a love letter to small town America, and the lesson to remain open to whatever opportunities and happiness come into your life.  Light erotic content does not take away from the story.  There is enough conflict to keep the reader from getting a âsugar rushâ from the lighter moments, and I think the blend is done very well.

"When Jackâs brother dies in a freak accident, Jack steps up â big time â to devote much of his life to help his sister-in-law raise their daughter there in New York City.  About eight years later, trouble surfaces, when Jack â a citizen of the UK here on a student visa â is turned down for a green card, and faces deportation.  While Jack is gay, he enlists the help of a lesbian co-worker to marry him, but she later panics when I.C.E. challenges their living situation.  In the interim, Jack has met Mano, and is in love.  Although Mano is a US citizen, and willing to marry Jack, this story took place when only the state would recognize a same-sex marriage, and, thus, it would not do him any good for federal immigration issues.Itâs ironic and unfortunate that this 2012 film was released on DVD more than two months after the court decision on DOMA essentially made much of the plot obsolete.  It still delivers a powerful message about love and relationships, delivered by a diverse, talented cast with good direction. David W. Ross, who plays Jack, also wrote the screenplay, and the film has won awards at several film festivals.  Unrated, likely would not be anything other than a PG-13.  DVD includes extensive extras, including a music video, deleted scenes, cast Q&A, and film festival coverage.  Great choice to show to someone who still doesnât âget the pointâ about why same-sex marriage is needed.

"Aleksandr is an illegal Russian immigrant, stranded alone in New York City after the death of his mother.  After meeting a guy at a bar and going home with him, he starts working as an escort, and seems to attract more than his share of con artists and abusers.  In sessions with a counselor, he whines about being lonely, sexual confusion, depression, wanting to build a friendship with some of the men who only want him for sex.  It is a variation of a story that has been told before, many times, and I even guessed the climatic final scene.Writer/director Pau Maso cast himself in the starring role, which is usually a bad idea.  His overacting occasionally seems like he is trying to do a poor impression of the late comic Andy Kaufman, but manages to come across as sexy in most scenes, when he is not going off on a drug or depression-fueled hallucination.  The most annoying part, to me, was the constant nerve-rattling music, including a single bar repeated endlessly for the last fifteen minutes of the film.  (The music actually drowned out the dialogue in some scenes on my screener copy, which I would assume were corrected in the final DVD.)  DVD has cast interviews and deleted scenes.  A fairly good effort, but falls short in my opinion.

"When Roy is asked to help plan the wedding of his friend Alana, he hesitates at first, because it means facing Alanaâs adopted brother Paul, a former alcoholic with whom he had a nasty breakup.  He asks his friend Gavin to come along and pose as his boyfriend.  Complications set in when the now-sober Paul seems to have lots in common with the (actually single) Gavin.One of the many reasons I love this film is that it is not a âgay filmâ, per se, although it has the aforementioned openly gay characters.  They are just part of a great ensemble cast of family (and âfamilyâ), with their sexuality just a minor detail in the qualities the group celebrates in each other.  The story touches on love and dedication, remembering the things that are truly important in life, and actually deals with changes in a marriage from years ago (Paul and Alanaâs parents, played by character actors Kristine Sutherland and James Rebhorn), Alana and her fiancÃ©â, as well as another marriage proposal still to come.  This is a heartwarming, amusing story that gay viewers do not have to hesitate a second to share with family and straight friends.DVD includes a âmaking ofâ featurette, and interviews with actors and a director/screenwriter.

"In May of 2012, Shane Britney Crone posted a heartbreaking video on YouTube, about his six year relationship with Tom Bridegroom.  The two young men, both from small Midwest towns, had met when Shane moved to California, and each knew he had met his ultimate soulmate.  Their love for each other was obvious to all around them, accepted by Shaneâs family and, it seemed, reluctantly by Tomâs parents.  When a tragic accident took Tomâs life, Shaneâs grief was further complicated by the decisionof Tomâs family to shut him out of the funeral arrangements, since they had no legal standing as a couple.The video was viewed over three million times, and translated into 20 languages.  Actors George Takai and Neil Patrick Harris were among those who approached Shane about the possibility of doing a full-length documentary on their story.  They brought Linda Bloodworth Thomason (âThe Golden Girlsâ) onboard to write and direct the film, and raised money from over 6500 people on Kickstarter to finance the production.  The result is absolutely amazing, and a âmust seeâ for anyone who believes that we live in a world where love must be respected.  The film won awards at numerous film festivals, including Best Documentary at both Outfest L.A. and the Tribeca Film Festival.  Rated R for adult content.  DVD includes some public service spots and the trailer.Strongly recommended, and suggest you show it to anyone who doesnât believe same-sex marriage is an important issue.

"A body is found in an Atlanta park, the victim of a horrific gay bashing, and it is identified as âblack sheepâ son of a rich tycoon, who had been working as a stripper (and possibly prostitute) for a local organized crime figure.  Assigned to the case is closeted Detective Sgt. Kendall Parker, recently returned from a leave recovering from an accident that was fatal to a friend.  There is no shortage of fingers being pointed at possible killers with various motives, including a city councilman who was photographed with the stripper.  The pressure on the police to solve the crime is turned up by an aggressive newspaper columnist who seems to be on a personal vendetta against Parker.The book is well-written, with reasonable situations and developments, and offers an intriguing look into the thought process, personal demons, peer pressure and bureaucratic nightmares that can plague a homicide detective working on such cases. As a diehard reader of gay mystery series, I enjoy that insight, which is lacking in many other in that genre.  The ending hints at further stories in this series, and I look forward to this authorâs efforts in providing them.

"When Lee Howe learns that her lover, the talented singer Devorah Manikian, died in a fire at the home of a wealthy impresario who was grooming her for a special operatic role, she is devastated.  She travels from her home in New York to that location, a pseudo-castle on the beach near San Diego.  She had already met, and disliked, Devorahâs benefactor, and suspects she was trying to steal her away from her.  While walking on the beach, Lee is sure that she hears Devorah singing from the castle, although everyone is quick to suggest it is just a response to her grieving and she needs to âget on with her life.â  Lee finds that impossible, until all of the questions surrounding the death are answered.The author paints a vivid, realistic Gothic plot with lots of suspense, colorful characters and unexplained occurrences.

"While looking for temporary summer work, Martin runs into a childhood friend, Eugenio, who hires him to do some odd jobs around his familyâs house.  Eugenio seems attracted to Martin from the start, but is very insecure that the feeling is mutual.  They relive many of their childhood adventures, which becomes a bit of a courtship ritual.  They are both rather uneasy about the direction their relationship seems to be going, with Martin the more reluctant to admit his feelings as they surface.This is a very emotional and highly sexy film, focusing solely on these two characters and their growing feelings for each other.  It is certain to resonate with those who recall misgivings about their early attempts at cultivating a loving relationship, reconciling their sexuality, and fearing rejection from someone who has become an important part of their lives. There are no real secondary characters, and relatively little dialogue, with most of the communication of their feelings acted beautifully through their actions we see on screen.The film was made in Argentina, and actually has nothing to do with Hawaii (except a reference that both of them considered it a bit of a nirvana when they were kids).  Recommended as a refreshingly simple film about the complex matter of love and sexuality, from a filmmaker, Marco Berger, who seems to have nailed down that concept several times.  In Spanish with English subtitles, and would be a light R rating for sexual situations and brief nudity.

"Mike is a shy loner, a closeted gay teen who develops an instant crush on the cute new guy in school, Will, with whom he is paired in a Literature project.  Both boys have dysfunctional families and lots of emotional baggage, and having that in common is part of their initial attraction to each other, which turns into the first love for both of them.  They struggle with self-acceptance, and then argue about how âopenâ they can be with classmates and parents.This is a sweet indie film from Australia, which won âBest filmâ at the Melbourne Queer Film Festival.  It is an ambitious effort to show the obstacles faced by many gay teens, cleverly illustrated in the coupleâs class project, a love story between two movie monsters who were alienated and shunned by others.  Unfortunately, the writer/director/producer/editor goes a bit overboard with the constant drama the two teens face alone, perhaps realistic for a decade or two ago, but it seems extreme in todayâs internet-connected world of growing acceptance and resources for LGBT youth.  This carries through to the climatic ending, which was powerful but I also found a bit unrealistic.  On the plus side, the two young actors playing the couple were capable and seemed to have a good chemistry, despite their being surrounded by the overacting in supporting roles.Film is unrated, but would be a light R for partial male nudity.

"When Mike Carlson stops to help an attack victim lying in a Chicago street, he never dreamed of the adventure to follow.  He had spotted the man earlier, while working as a waiter in a popular gay restaurant, and noted some apparent eccentricities of behavior.  He soon found out why:  John was actually a traveler from another planet, sent to bring back a criminal who is believed to be hiding there on Earth.  As they start talking, Mike is curious about the alien, but also finds himself somewhat attracted to the hunky, intelligent young man.  Could the attraction be mutual?It is great to see one of my favorite gay mystery writers back in action, and this new series could fill a needed niche in the sci-fi genre.  Like all of Zubroâs works, this is a well-written story that features fully-nuanced gay and straight characters in realistic situations.  Iâm not a huge sci-fi fan, but I loved every page of this, as he resisted the common mistake of making things we donât understand too far âover the topâ to be believed.  Worth a read.

After several job offers fell through, Chris reluctantly agrees to a proposition from a young woman, whose brother died in Chrisâ unit overseas.  She hires Chris to seduce and kill Andrew, her brotherâs lover, in order to receive a valuable inheritance that would otherwise go to him.This film is directed by Sean Paul Lockhart, aka gay pornâs Brett Corrigan, who also plays Andrew.  Judging by Lockhartâs long-winded introduction that preceded the film on the DVD, I wasnât expecting much, but it was somewhat better than my reduced expectations.  The plot is far-fetched and far from cohesive, some scenes are stretched out way too long, and the acting by the secondary characters is cartoonish.  Still, the story does provide some suspense, and the final reveal is something I was not expecting, so Iâll give them three stars out of five for effort and eye-candy.

"When Remington was six years old, he innocently taunted a feminine man as âHomo,â and the man responded by putting a curse on him, saying he would âturnâ gay when he became an adult.  Fast forward fifteen years, and the young man experiences some strange visions which are followed by a change in his preferences in clothes, music, behavior and â ultimately â a crush on his best friend.  And this comes at a time when a serial killer is on the loose, using a âgaydarâ gun that turns its victims into drag queens before killing them. Before he becomes a victim, Remington tries to find a way to reverse his curse, just the risen drag queen zombies terrorize the town!  Oh, my!Deliciously over-the-top and campy, this 2011 hit comedy from the Philippines is actually quite gay-positive in its message of self-acceptance and mutual tolerance, while poking fun at small-town homophobia.  As Remington, young Martin Escudero shows flawless comedic range, and you believe his apparent amazement that he is suddenly uncontrollably swinging his hips as he walks.  The rest of the cast seems somewhat wooden, especially the local police (which is led by Remingtonâs mother, a nice touch.)  Good photography and direction, though the special effects are laughable in this low-budget indie.  Interestingly, it is double subtitled, in English for the Tagalog that makes up most of the film, but also in Tagalog and English for the dialogue in Baklese, which is apparently local gay slang.

The problem worsens after Goyo had a tryst with a new young man in the camp, who Rosa later becomes interested in an starts dating.  Ramon throws Goyo out of the house for trying to seduce his sister's fiancÃ©.This is an emotional, well-acted 2010 coming-of-age film, written by a screenwriter who based it on his own family.  I felt the characters of the sister and the mother were rather one-dimensional, and would have liked to see more development there.  Overall, however, this is a touching story that illustrates how society's preconceptions can hurt a young man such as Goyo.This film is bilingual, since the older generation talks in Spanish while the younger ones speak English.

"Scotty is anticipating an uneasy week, on vacation with his parents, their friends and the friends' kids, at a remote mountain resort in upstate New York.  He gets along fine with the other teens, but is apprehensive because it will be the first time he sees them after having ""come out"" as gay to them via e-mail, and he is unsure how supportive they will be.  When Scotty came out at school, he could simply avoid those who had a problem with it, but that won't be possible to do when he's stuck in that group all week.Besides, Scotty is worried about his boyfriend, Marc, who has a very strict, homophobic father.  They had been extremely careful around him, and he even had to censor his text messages, in case the father saw Marc's phone.When they get settled in at the resort, a new level of uneasiness arises, from the rumors of haunting that go on in the area, especially at an abandoned shack a short distance toward the lake.  Scotty soon finds out that he seems to have a special connection to one of the ghosts, who bears a striking resemblance to Marc!  The teens ask locals about theories about the haunting, and research news articles that might provide an answer to both the haunting and Scotty's seeming connection to it all.Greg Herren is a master at gay fiction, with his young adult stories just as well written as his more popular mysteries.  One of the best things about his YA efforts is that he challenges his readers, exposing them to situations and subplots which may not be comfortable or easily related, but which ultimately lead through captivating developments to the ultimate resolution of the story.

"Paulo (Matila Malliarakis) is a somewhat naïve young man, living with a girlfriend with whom he has a mostly platonic relationship.  One night, he goes out drinking with friends, and overdoes it, but not before he is noticed by the hunky bartender, Ilir (Guillaume Gouix), who takes him to his place to sleep it off.  Ilir stirs some feelings in Paulo that he is not yet comfortable about, but the older man is patient and lets their chemistry develop slowly.  Eventually, Paulo's girlfriend gets wind of what is happening, and throws him out, at which point Ilir - who prefers to keep his options open - reluctantly agrees to take him in.  Their relationship grows into love, until Ilir has to travel with a band he is in, leaving the codependent Paulo waiting anxiously for his return.  Unfortunately, situations develop that could keep them apart forever, and Paulo must consider other options, which could result in a drastic change in his life.I commend the screenwriter and director for providing realistic/gritty characters with no shortage of personal baggage, yet who seem to be on a path to making a relationship work. The two leads give an outstanding performance in their roles, and the emotional melodrama seems fairly real.

"Writer/director Reid Waterer offers two short films in his DVD, ""Global Warming.""  I'll review each separately, then give you comments on the DVD as a whole.""You Can't Curry Love"" (2009) has been making the LGBT film festival circuit for over three years, so many of you may have already caught it.  If not, let me give you a summary:  Starts in UK, where Vikas, a young man (of Indian descent, is sent by his employer on a temporary assignment to their office in India.  While he was born in Australia, Vikas feels that he knows everything about India, until he meets hotel clerk Sunil, with whom there is an immediate mutual attraction, and he explores local sights and learns more of the culture.  It is the first time Vikas has really felt in love, but he is due back in the UK office soon.  The two leads are played by talented straight actors who do a great job in their roles.  On its own, I'd give this 23 minute film five stars out of five, and only wish it were a full-length feature.Speaking of straight actors playing gay ... ""Performance Anxiety"" (2012) tells that story, of two heterosexual actors who agreed to be naked in a gay sex scene.  They try to push their training and experience as actors to overcome their natural, macho revulsion to what they have to do.  It's one absurd plan (When they kiss, one suggests that the other pretend to be a lifeguard giving him mouth-to-mouth!) to another (Instead of hair, imagine big breasts on his chest!), it's amusing, but - IMO - gets tiresome rather quickly.  To their credit, the two actors don't come off as homophobic, just reacting to a situation that they obviously find more uncomfortable than they had imagined it would be for an actor. The film only runs 15 minutes (but seems longer to me). Has also made the rounds at a lot of LGBT film festivals in the past years, and won some kudos.  I'll be kind and give it 3 stars out of 5,Add the running times of the two films, and you have less than 40 minutes combined, pretty sparse for a DVD release. The writer/director apparently thought he'd pad the release with ""extras,"" which add a total of 50 minutes ... if you watch them all, including trailers, photo galleries, deleted scenes, outtakes and respective ""making of"" documentaries.I found the ""making of"" film on ""You Can't Curry Love"" to be somewhat entertaining, and it fills in some blanks about gay life in India, which are only hinted at in the actual short film (Another reason why I think the filmmaker was foolish not to make a full-length film.)  On the other hand, the extras for ""Performance Anxiety"" are - in my opinion - intolerable. Think about it:  You have a film about straight actors in a gay movie, so the extras would be about ... you guessed it ... the straight actors PLAYING the straight actors who are making a gay movie.  Can you say redundant??  (Now, if he had hired gay actors to play the straight actors who were playing gay on screen, at least there would be something new in the extras to watch!)  Even though the two films average out to 4 stars, I am tempted to subtract one star because of the extras, but I'll be nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B2JIOPHUT7IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIR4JA6#wasThisHelpful","R2B2JIOPHUT7IW","A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark, a shy high school freshman with mild Asperger's Syndrome, was very close to his super-popular older brother, Chaz, to whom he felt much closer than his parents, who were somewhat emotionally distant from him.  When Chaz gets killed in an auto accident, Mark has to deal not only with his own grief, but being virtually ignored by his parents, who are dealing with their own issues.  One of Chaz's friends, Doug, takes Mark under his wing, and he joins the ""study group"" (actually a weekly poker game) with Chaz's friends, including Randy, to whom Chaz was the closest.  The distraction of learning to play poker (which he does remarkably well, with great effort) gives Mark a welcome distraction, but he really relishes the times the group talks about Chaz.  When he learns that Chaz was a volunteer at a local diversity community center, Mark checks that out, eventually learning about a part of his brother's life that he never shared.Director Quentin Lee does his usual remarkable job with a challenging screenplay, and gets standout performances from a talented cast.  Mark is played by Booboo Stewart (""Twilight"") with his brother Chaz was Harry Shum Jr. (""Glee""); their parents are played by BD Wong and Joan Chen. The actor playing Doug, Tyler Posey, is a current popular heartthrob for his starring role in MTV's remake of ""Teen Wolf.""The gay aspect of the film is not evident until the latter third, which is a commendable move, in making it clear that the characters' hang-ups go way beyond homophobia. The film pushes the envelope in pointing out that educated, upper-middle income people, including racial minorities, may be so worried about ""fitting in"" that they are not as open-minded as they may believe.  ""White Frog"" made the rounds of many gay film festivals, and I was surprised not to see any awards listed, other than one at the Philadelphia Asian Film Festival.

"Likely you've met heterosexuals who feel they can always ""spot"" a homosexual man or woman, usually relying on some stereotype they believe is conclusive of sexual orientation.  Is it only fair that we get to do the same?  This amusing book, done as a satire of guides for bird watchers, is designed to help.From their migratory habits to shopping behaviors, from their taste in food to curious entertainment choices, as well as their fashion/decorator sense (or lack thereof), the Guide helps the reader differentiate true heterosexuals from, say, gay Republicans.  Of course, we also get into their courtship and dating rituals (including a complete guide to playing ""beer pong"") and, for the sake of providing a comprehensive guide, how they reproduce (Apparently, music by Kenny G somehow helps.)  Last but not least, there is a glossary of hetero slang terms (such as ""Bro"" which stands for Brother, but doesn't actually refer to someone who is your brother.)Truth be told, if a straight author came out with a similar ""How to Spot Homosexuals"" book, the pearl-clutching activists in our community would throw a fit.  And that would be a shame, because we need to recognize good-natured humor when we read it, such as in this book.

"In this, the seventh book in Abramson's ""Beach Reading"" series, the gang is in a period of transition.  Artie and his lover Arturo are taking a leave from their Castro restaurant, for Artie's comeback singing tour.  Aunt Ruth is back behind the bar, helping to keep an eye on things while they are gone, although she would much rather be spending leisure evenings with her still husband.  And everyone in the Castro is buzzing about a daring series of armed robberies, by a duo who seems to be very good at what they do.Ruth's nephew, and the restaurant's most popular waiter, Tim is missing his boyfriend, Nick, who is away in Europe, assisting his grandmother on a book tour, and thinking they should have had a talk about monogamy before he left.  Even Tim's usual clairvoyant dreams seem to be sidetracked by his libido, with the exception of rather disturbing flashes about a plane crash.  Tim's erotic temptations fight daily with the potential guilt of his actions, and he can't help but wonder if Nick feels the same way, or perhaps has taken advantage of such situations that have faced him.I've been a big fan of this series since its inception, and it is always good to get to visit with Abramson's realistic, fully-nuanced characters.  I was also happy to see further development of some secondary characters introduced in earlier books.  Overall, however, I have to admit I found this one to be a bit weak in storyline, compared to the others, and hope it is just a temporary misstep.

"In a popular gay cruising spot in Paris, Angelo is a young, inexperienced hustler who is beaten up by a john, and is rescued by the 30-something pickpocket/prostitute Vassili.  The two soon form a connection over their mutual distrust for people, and enter into a personal/business relationship, hustling as a couple. Angelo learns quickly about Vassili's violent tendencies, which eventually force them to leave Paris to avoid prosecution.  They search for a place where they can be safe and ultimately happy forever, hoping the violence is behind them.The filmmaker presents a vivid but dark look at a dysfunctional relationship, as the two look for some level of contentment in their lives.

"In 1979 West Hollywood, a newly divorced man, Paul (Garret Dillahunt), is reconciling his sexuality, and meets drag performer Rudy (Alan Cumming). Before their relationship can fully develop, a third party is added:  Marco, a 14 year old boy with Down Syndrome, who is abandoned when his single mother (Rudy's neighbor) is arrested for prostitution.  Marco's mother agrees to name Rudy and Paul as temporary guardians, and they become a happy family ... for a while.  A homophobic co-worker of Paul's challenges Marco's safety with the couple, and that sets off a dramatic court case, all too realistic for its time.  They argue that the primary consideration should be what is best for Marco, not whether Rudy sings in drag or Paul was not honest with his boss about his relationship.  .This is an extremely emotional, dramatic telling of a situation that, to some extent, would still occur today in many cities.  It also redefines what makes up a ""family,"" with Dillahunt's character showing the most personal growth as a self-assured, proud gay man.  There are also many scenes stolen by Isaac Leyva, who played Marco.  The film won several audience awards at film festivals, and was a finalist for a GLAAD Media Award. A little slow in places, and I thought the blues singing was overdone a bit, but the positives balance out all that, for a full five stars out of five.PS:  Most of the other reviews I have read mention the couple was trying to ""adopt"" the boy.

"It's NYC in the late 1990's, where Erik (Thure Lindhardt) is a budding filmmaker from Denmark, supported by his family while working on a documentary for the past four years. While trolling for sex on a phone line, he meets Paul (Zachary Booth), and closeted attorney for a publisher, they discover a sexual and emotional connection, and eventually move in together. Erik is aware, early on, that Paul smokes crack cocaine, but is unaware of how his addiction is growing, to the point where he eventually disappears from his job and their apartment. They manage to stay together for close to a decade, despite Paul's stints in rehab and subsequent failures to maintain his sobriety. Erik sees Paul's failures as a reflection of his own inability to follow-through on things (like his film), and becomes obsessed with ""saving"" Paul, despite friends' advice and common sense telling him it just may not happen, despite his best efforts and intentions.Based loosely on a personal experience by the movie's director/co-writer, Ira Sacks, the film's subject matter is obviously rather dark and depressing at times, though realistic for someone going through a rather masochistic relationship with an addict. The acting and technical quality are first rate, although the film's pacing seems to bog down at times, suggesting that more editing would have been an improvement. Film is unrated (would be an R for sexual content, though no complete nudity), and appeared in several film festivals (including Sundance). DVD extras include ""Making of"" short, deleted scenes, commentary and auditions. Although this film has gotten a lot of attention, I didn't find it that impressive, and am being generous with three stars out of five.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R181DGXG6BCYDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009PJ1Q82#wasThisHelpful","R181DGXG6BCYDD","A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the surface, the new documentary ""Out In The Open"" has a definite ""It Gets Better""-vibe, as it consists primarily of various gay, lesbian and transgender people talking about the problems they faced growing up, being tormented by peers, possibly shunned by family and friends, but also how they managed to cope with it all, and found self-acceptance, success and happiness in time.  The film starts off as a parody of a mid-20th Century TV show spotlighting ""Homosexual Demons"" and what they do to society.  Cute as an attention getter, and provides a backdrop of the prevailing attitudes in which many of us may have grown up.Besides offering an unusually diverse group of interviewees, the pluses include the heartfelt interviews with Olympic diver Greg Louganis. Carson Kressley (""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy""), actors Eric and Eliza Roberts (who have a lesbian daughter), and Broadway heartthrob Josh Strickland, as well as several interviews with close friends, family members and co-workers of some of the LGBT folk interviewed, giving their perspective on their struggles. The documentary's writer/director Matthew Smith is also interviewed in his film, along with his partner Solly Hemus. Segments also include comments from their family members about their respective childhoods, how they met, etc. Not really any new ground here, but a nice, concise look at various experiences, attitudes and outlooks.Not rated, but would be a mild R for sexual discussions, the DVD is set to contain many extras, including short films by at-risk LGBT youth.

"While many think of an island paradise as carefree, life is not easy in Largo Bay, Jamaica.  The main industry is fishing, which no longer supports enough families, resulting in poverty and a lack of basic services, such as law enforcement. Progress is also held back by a religious, conservative native population, with tones of racism and homophobia making it an unfriendly (and possibly deadly) place for tourists.Eric Keller is a white American who took up residence in Largo fifteen years earlier, and had opened a hotel which was destroyed by a subsequent hurricane. With the help and partnership of Shad Myers, who works at the bar he salvaged from the hotel's debris, he has been contacted by an outside investor to rebuild the hotel, if they can work out plans to make it economically feasible. Knowing what this would mean to the local economy, Eric and Shad try to get the other locals to support their efforts, and Eric brings in his estranged adult son, Joseph, to help with the financial plans.  Although Joseph seems to hook up with a local's beautiful daughter, there are still lots of rumors, some based on one of his previous visits, that Joseph may be a ""batty"" (gay) man.  In his role as unofficial peacekeeper, Shad tries to find the source of the comments and outright death threats directed at Joseph, and keep him safe without jeopardizing the plans for the hotel.  It's a journey that takes them all to levels they never imagined.Ms. Royes calls this a sequel to her earlier novel, ""The Goat Woman of Largo Bay,"" but it does not rely on that book for a complete understanding and enjoyment of this one.  It is well-written, engaging and suspenseful, and much recommended.

Staying with their friend Magnus (former child actor Jussie Smollett), who is five months into a new relationship himself, the friends discuss their relationship woes, and are there to offer comfort when several go very bad during the course of their visit.  Joey and Langston challenge each other to be the first to find the confidence to approach seemingly unreachable partners at a club.

The longest is the final story, ""Ordinary Mayhem"" by Victoria A. Brownsworth, exploring the connection of a uniquely-talented photographer to her deceased grandfather.

What he didn't expect was for Luke to be much more mature than his years, despite a lack of confidence resulting from a childhood of abuse and foster homes, and find himself much more attracted to the young man as a person.

Will love ultimately prevail?A simple, well-written story with relatable characters.

"Matthew is an inexperienced gay teen, a byproduct of an evangelical Christian upbringing that instilled guilt and repression as a seeming fact of life for him. A hidden porn magazine is discovered by his best friend, Brandon who turns out to be gay as well. Unfortunately, they are discovered by Matthew's father, who informs Brandon's parents. Matthew is sent away, and the two of them reunite at an ex-gay conversion camp for teens, which they manage to survive and return home. Brandon refuses to lie to his mother about having been ""converted"" to heterosexuality, and is thrown out of his home. Matthew decides to leave with him, and they attempt to put together a life together. They have better luck than most gay teen runaways, but the film makes it clear the risks and perils they face.This is one of the strangest gay films I have ever seen. It addresses the ""gay and Christian"" message on an extremely simplistic level, which I personally feel most viewers would consider a bit condescending.  This ambitious film includes several unexpected animated and musical sequences, likely meant to teach as well as entertain ...  but one can only deal with so many verses of songs like ""Jesus Is In My Pants"" or ""The Dingleberry Song.""  The cute, twinkish couple (played by Aaron Judge and Alex ""Bear City"" DiDio) do a commendable job with dialogue that invites a lot of eye-rolling on the part of the viewer.  However, I did find the frequent explicit sexual dialogue a bit off-putting in a supposed ""message"" film such as this.

"Coming of age, in a small town near Charleston SC, are a group of high school seniors involved in their local Baptist church's drama and music ministry.  The film focuses primarily on three of these students:  Brea, daughter of the church's minister but who finds herself questioning her Christian beliefs; Tim, a very personable and talented young man who has revealed - to his single dad and closest friends - that he is gay; and Laura, an ambitious and focused girl who expresses doubts at the revelations of the other two.  They are involved in an Easter pageant, under the direction of  Austin (Stephen Cone, who also wrote and directed the film), whose working with the self-assured Tim makes him suspect what may be the reason for his own passion-less eight year marriage.  While most of the graduates will be going to nearby colleges, Brea and Tim will be attending schools in New York City, which makes their friends and family wonder if and how it will change them.With a tiny budget, Cone manages to create a film that feels understated and subtle, while at the same time riveting the viewer and delivering a cohesive, powerful message of self-acceptance, diversity and true friendship.  It does not challenge religion or sexuality, but reinforces that they can coincide among people who respect each other.  The acting is superb, especially Tyler Ross (who also starred in ""Nate and Margaret) as Tim, and Molly Kunz as the complex yet relatable Brea. Won highest awards at the Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta and Memphis LGBT film festivals, and awarded a Critic's Pick by the New York Times.

"A shy, fourteen year old boy makes a friend at school, realizes he is gay, and - for the first time - feels truly live.  But that is not to last, and he grows into a man, still living with his invalid mother, until - at age 40 - he finds the courage to run away with the circus, as the lover of an eccentric Romanian trapeze artist, When that adventure ends, he is still fascinated by the life he learned on the road, and makes drastic renovations to his mother's house to carry it on.The story is told in numerous installments, alternating the three time periods mentioned above.  The protagonist - whom the author never actually names - makes a very slow, dramatic and torturous journey from his dysfunctional, sheltered childhood to his own version of maturity, which involves following his dream, regardless of what common sense (and others) tells you otherwise.

"In ""Absent"" (Argentina 2011), 16 year old Martin has a crush on his 30 year old swim coach, Sebastian. The teen fakes an injury to spend some time alone with him, and to con him into spending the night at the coach's apartment. While none of Martin's fantasies come true that evening, it forces the coach to examine his own hidden desires, especially after an unexpected tragedy forces the night into focus.This is an artfully-made film, with intense sexual tension throughout, conveyed mostly by the director's timing and staging of the story. Impatient viewers may have problems with this, and the seemingly drawn out (and often repeated at the end) scenes. This was illustrated in an article I read about the director's talk when the film showed at the 2011 Berlin Film Festival (where it won Best Feature Film), which made it clear a good percentage of that film-buff audience misunderstood what had happened at the end of the film. (I'll admit I was confused as well, but guessed correctly as to what had transpired.) Not exactly my choice for a relatable, enjoyable film, but I'll still give it 4 stars out of 5 on merit.

"Will (Ronnie Kerr, who is also the writer and producer of the film) is fresh out of the Navy after a number of years, and staying temporarily with his older friend, Rich. Rich plays matchmaker, despite Will's protests, and arranges for him to meet the hunky Josh, also a former Navy man. They get off on the wrong foot, until a devastating event forces them together, and somewhat puts in perspective their need for each other.The plot is a bit formulaic and predictable, and the secondary characters - while somewhat realistic - are mostly over-the-top stereotypes. I give the screenwriter props for including different generations of gay men as friends, and the attempt at illustrating the minefields one might encounter in trying to cultivate a relationship. Josh is played by Ian Roberts, a former Australian rugby star who created quite a stir when he came out as gay in the late 1990's.

"Over the years, there are many gay stories that have been based in New Orleans, and for good reason. It is a unique city, with a highly diverse population which tends to embrace differences, forgive misdeeds and does what is necessary to live to one's potential. These factors are all present in this anthology of nine short stories by the author, dealing with New Orleans, before Hurricane Katrina's devastation.Though none of the stories are dependent on any other, there are some common themes and situations, and some of the characters referenced may seem to coincide. While all are about men from New Orleans, some gay and some not, two of the stories actually take place in New York City, with characters that clearly miss their original roots.  The stories feature a variety of blue collar and white collar individuals, including some on the fringes of society, in any city.  There are equal doses of wit, longing, poignancy, hope, seduction and loss, all woven together by this talented author.

"In this new play, which received critic praise in its limited NYC run last year, we meet Jay and Phyllis Berman, a 30-something (mostly) Orthodox Jewish couple in New York City, raising their autistic son. Their life gets a bit spicy when Stuart Weinstein, a handsome and busy doctor, meets with Phyllis to arrange for her to cater a party he is planning. Phyllis is somewhat attracted to Stuart passion and charisma.  She is also fascinated by the fact that he is gay, but doesn't see that as a contradiction to his faith, and enjoys discussing that with him at length. When Phyllis invites Stuart to have dinner with the two of them, it's obvious that there is a tension between the two men, one that signals a potential rift in their otherwise happy marriage.Besides the text of the play, complete with stage directions and notes, the book contains an essay on the faith's official stand on homosexuality, as well as personal essays from two Jewish men, one who went through the faith's ex-gay movement, and another who has learned to embrace both his religion and being gay.  Also included are details on the production history of the play, with photos.Although I usually avoid reading plays, this one held my interest, and I found it somewhat enlightening.

"Young high school teacher Skyler Foxe is back, newly ""outed"" (along with his boyfriend, teacher/assistant coach Keith Fletcher, who convinces him to dance with him at a school function.) Shortly thereafter, he learns that Keith has been keeping a big secret from him, and breaks off their relationship, just as he needs support to face the scrutiny resulting from the ""outing."" And Skyler also must contend with his mother, to whom the revelation was a bit of a shock.Meanwhile, the ongoing series of injuries and mysterious events at the school have local police, and even the FBI, searching for some kind of criminal activity, possibly involving the football coach and other faculty members.  As usual, Skyler gets involved, in pursuing possible leads he feels the professionals are not properly investigating, and finds himself in peril more than once. Thankfully, he has Keith, his best female friend Detective Sidney Feldman, and a trio of his ""ex"" lovers who know him well, and try to save him from himself.In this third of a introductory trilogy to the series (Although this could be read independently, I strongly recommend they be read in order), the author does a commendable job of spinning a rather complex crime mystery, intermixed with enough wit and erotic content to keep readers turning the pages.  Though I have some issues with the eventual ""over the top"" revelation involved (which the author claims was based on actual events), the story is otherwise excellent, and I can't see anything less than a perfect five stars out of five.- Bob Lind, Echo Magazine","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18RMSG1X90DF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608208109#wasThisHelpful","R18RMSG1X90DF0","A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sayen Homet is a young Muslim man, working his way through Stanford Medical School as best he can. His mother already sacrificed considerably to get him to America, and could not help him pay for school, so Sayen found another way:  hooking up with an older man, his secret Sugar Daddy.When Sayen meets Campbell Reardon, another med student with whom he feels an instant - and lustful - connection. Campbell is also rich, and is more than willing to support Sayen financially, so he ends his arrangement with the older man.  As the young couple continues to date, Sayen is brought to meet Campbell's parents, and learns that his former ""Sugar Daddy"" is Campbell's father!One would think the story ends there, but that's really just the start of the action, as various emotions, prejudices and grudges surface on the part of the young couple, Campbell's father (who is still in love with Sayen himself), Campbell's mother (who doesn't well the news of her husband's affair), and sister Halle (who is pregnant with her Muslim boyfriend's baby.)

"Jameson Currier happens to be one of my favorite authors, and I relished his three previous novels, although he is perhaps best known by his diverse and captivating short stories that have appeared in various anthologies and other publications over the years.  This work actually combines fifteen of his short stories, crafting them into chapters in a story of a single gay man and his failure to find a meaningful relationship.The stories were written over a period of many years, so it is fitting that a similar time period applies to the character depicted, starting with his first realization about his sexuality at age 15. The next chapter follows the young man ten years later, and subsequent installments show the character maturing, having various sexual encounters, though still unsuccessful in finding a potential lifemate.It was a little confusing to me that the stories were written in the second person, which I can only guess was meant to add some distance from the reader to the character, as if a disjointed voyeur through his disappointing love life.  That disappointment, although realistic, became a bit tedious for me at times, and I kept assuming he would eventually find the love of his life.  It was also a bit depressing to read the seemingly desperate measures that the character took in his later years.Not really a ""fun"" read, but an interesting and realistic character study by a talented, creative author.

"How did young Thomas Newton end up a male-male prostitute in 18th Century London?  It began when his aristocrat father walked in on a dalliance he was having with a male servant, after which they were both banned from that home, and Thomas was disowned.  He found his way to London, where he was fortunate enough to find a surrogate parent in Mother Clap, half of a married couple who run a discrete tavern and male brothel. Unfortunately, their peaceful enterprise is soon targeted by a homophobic group, called The Society for the Reformation of Manners, which has appointed itself the ultimate authority in ""crimes against nature."" Those charged by these vigilantes are soon tried, convicted and executed, often by closeted officials who may have used their services.When Mother Clap is arrested and imprisoned, awaiting trial, Thomas knows he needs to risk his own life to get her freedom.  Knowing things will never be the same again, he fights for the only person who has ever showed him unconditional love.I don't usually like ""period"" novels like this, but I found this one very engaging and well-written.

"Matt (Matthew Wilson) is a young gay man who works in a comic store.  He's fresh out of a six year failed relationship, and having problems finding someone new.  He commiserates with his longtime best friend, yoga instructor Jenn (Jenn Harris), who is also lonely, and suggests that they have a baby together.  Matt is open to the idea, but a bit stunned when Jenn vetoes the ""turkey baster"" method, and insists they conceive the ""old fashioned way.""  Uh, huh.Their initial attempts make for some rather amusing almost-slapstick laughs.  But neither anticipated it would take months of such attempts, which made it a bit difficult to date others on the side, while ""saving themselves"" for each other. When they compromise and decide to try do-it-yourself artificial insemination, Matt's campy friend Nelson (actually, the film's writer/director, Jonathan Lisecki, in a scene-stealing role), offers his assistance, since he went through the same process with a lesbian friend. At the same time, both Matt and Jenn find too-hot-to-wait lovers, leading to some guilt feelings and possible regrets.This is a very funny, somewhat over-the-top comedy, with excellent acting and direction.  Appropriate for mixed gay/straight audiences, and definitely a positive outlook on the concept of gay parenting as well as supportive straight allies.  Won several awards at gay and regional film fests,and nominee for a 2013 Independent Spirit Award.  Not rated, but would be a light R for sexual content, although there is no nudity.

"Beth Ditto is a feminist, lesbian, overweight advocate of body image acceptance, prospective style and fashion guru, but best known as the lead singer of the indie rock band, Gossip.  Her memoir begins with stories of her unique, fractured childhood in rural Arkansas, where she exiled herself from her own home to live with an eccentric aunt and her incest-prone son, until her music became her ticket out to the Pacific Northwest.  It was there that she formed the band Gossip, refined their post-punk unique sound, and honed her aggressive stage presence to become an international star of that genre.The first part of the book includes some rather shocking stories of her life through her teens, where she was a frequent target of abuse and bullying, living in a deeply conservative backwoods, where women and other races were often treated as inferior citizens.  It is remarkable how she managed to not just survive in that environment, but actually to use it to take the strength she needed to turn her life around and be a success. Though I am not a fan of her type of music, her story is enough to make me a fan of hers.

"Still in his early 20's, Andrew McNellis is in his second year of teaching high school math, still enjoying his choice of profession, despite occasional bouts with problem students who just refuse to cooperate and do the work.  In his advanced placement senior class is Robert Westfall, an openly-gay member of the school band guard, respected by his peers, as well as a conscientious and disciplined student. A memo from the school counselor advises Andrew and the other teachers that Robert is going through a difficult time, with his father in the last stages of terminal cancer. Andrew is going through a difficult time as well, as this is the first time he has felt an outright sexual attraction to a student.  While Robert is 17, the age of consent in his state (and only 6 years younger than he is), Andrew knows that doing anything about his attraction, even though he senses Robert feels it as well, could ruin his career, and perhaps the young man's future.This is the second excellent young adult/coming-of-age novel from this author.  He tackles a sensitive subject with realistic situations, characters and outcome, making for a captivating and relatable read. The secondary characters, including Andrew's ex-wife and young daughter, as well as a female teacher pursuing the closeted Andrew, add considerable depth and clarity to the emotional story.

"Ricky (""RJ"") Smith is a 20 year old who is interrupting his college studies to fulfill his Mormon missionary obligation.  He is paired with Chris Merrill, also 20, who has already been at that work for a while, and the duo is expected to spend every moment of the day and night together.  As is the custom, RJ must follow Chris' lead, as he is the more experienced of the two, and RJ respects that, which makes it more difficult for him to understand when Chris loses control when they are verbally attacked by a potential convert who challenges the Church's stand on polygamy. RJ also must take charge when they encounter a couple of homophobic rednecks who hate Mormons.It is not until later in the movie that it is established that both RJ and Chris had been repressing feelings that they could be gay, and the closeness between the two eventually develops into a loving, physical relationship ...  one that, if it is discovered, could force then from the church and possibly alienate them from their families.This film has been compared to ""Latter Days,"" another film about a gay Mormon missionary, but is actually quite different, on several levels. It seems more realistic to me, in depicting the mindset of the two young men as they face a life-changing decision. The cast of mostly unknown actors performs well, and - except for some issues with dialogue being drowned out by background music and noise - the production values are good.My advance screener copy did not have the additional ""Making of..."" featurette (which is the norm for screeners), but surprisingly also had no credits, either opening or closing.

"Gary and Larry Lane are 35 year old gay twins, originally from a conservative church family in North Carolina, who are chasing their actor/screenwriter dreams in Hollywood.  Their most ambitious joint effort is a screenplay called ""Full Circle,"" featuring the songs of Dolly Parton, with a role for her in the film.  They decide the best way to get the screenplay in her hands is to embark in a five day drive cross country, from Hollywood to where she is scheduled to appear at her theme park, Dollywood, in Tennessee.  Along to help with the driving is Mike, Gary's boyfriend. They also meet many folks along the way, and share their stories of growing up in a family in which, more than a decade after leaving home, they are still not comfortable being open with their sexuality.The film's listing on some sites suggests it is ""starring"" Chad Allen, Dustin Lance Black, Beth Grant and Leslie Jordan, but these are simply actors who are acquainted with the twins and provide cameo appearances early in the film, before the trip.  Parts of more than a dozen of Dolly's songs make up the soundtrack of the film, and there is a brief scene with her at the end of the film.  The lesson here is in the three young men, and a few of those they met along the way, talking about how their family's reaction to their sexuality impacted their lives, and how Dolly's songs provided comfort.  Sounds strange, but it actually kind of works, mostly due to the pleasant and engaging cast.  Film won numerous ""Best Documentary"" prizes in LGBT film festivals worldwide, and was spotlighted on Rose O'Donnell's show.  DVD is not rated, but there is nothimg here that would not allow a PG.

"The author has been a gifted and dedicated spokesperson for LGBT equality for several decades, and has been a sought-after guest lecturer for dozens of organizations and educational institutions working for diversity and justice for all.  Nine of those presentations, some going back as much as twenty years, form the core of this book, which also includes a concise introduction and complete cites to studies and concepts quoted in her talks.Ms. Vaid's point is simple, really:  The fight for LGBT equality should not attempt to operate in a vacuum apart from other battles for diversity and justice, including those tackling matters of race, gender, religion and economic class, which also should demand the attention of anyone fighting for equality based on sexual orientation.

"Elliot is a cute Latino 21 year old gay boy who is looking for love in New York City ...  not exactly an original concept in itself, but this film is unique in its approach and characters, making it a must-see, in my opinion.Scenes of the current day Elliot, meeting a series of men who turn out to be shallow, not interested in a committed relationship and seemingly incapable of love, are interspersed with scenes from Elliot's childhood, growing up with a single mom who seems to be attracted to men that are no good for her or her son.  His mother's futile search for love, as well as the abuse they both suffer from one of her boyfriends, no doubt impact on Elliot's need to be securely loved and protected.The acting is a cut above what you would expect from a low-budget indie, especially the two actors who play Elliot, as a child and young adult.  Numerous Latino actors play Elliot's friends and family, lending a realistic, warm tone to the film.  The direction is excellent, including creative touches, such as the use of animated sequences in one of Elliot's ""looking for love"" adventures and in the closing credits.

"The scene is a small Massachusetts town in 1961, where an eclectic and colorful mix of lesbians, gay men as well as a few other diverse locals, frequent the Old Town Tavern, an oasis in that otherwise seedy part of town.  Over the years, the bar's owners, employees and customers have formed a family of sorts, and are generally there for each other whenever someone needs to talk, cry, celebrate or cope with life's disappointments. As was common in such times, most are deeply in the closet, and their time at the Old Town is the only time they can open up without fear of being discovered.Things start to change when the local police seem to be spending a lot of time observing outside the bar, which makes some of the regulars leery about being there. Egged on by a local candidate for mayor, the police eventually raid the bar, causing physical and emotional injuries that may not ever be able to completely heal.  While this drives some patrons away, it strengthens the bonds between them, as they help each other through their ordeals and take steps to make it unlikely to happen again.The story is told through the eyes of Rockie Solomon, a business-minded, generous middle-aged lesbian who owns a local bindery and has pretty much given up on finding new love after the painful loss of a partner. While there are gay male characters, most of the story centers around the many lesbian character and their lives, with light erotic content that is not out of place in that context.An interesting and well-written story, from an author who has been a major force in lesbian novels for over 40 years.

"""Elvis"" is a rebellious, young lesbian photographer, on her own in bustling Copacabana.  On her part-time job delivering pizzas, she encounters Lady Madonna, a transgender man who works as a hairdresser and has dreams of staging a huge show showcasing her drag talents. Elvis arrives right after Madonna had been beaten up and robbed by her sometimes-boyfriend known as Tripod Joe, Elvis helps Madonna get back on her feet, and the couple eventually form an unlikely loving couple, soon to be a family.  When Tripod Joe ends up in jail, thanks to a photo taken of him by Elvis, he swears revenge against the couple, and their lives take a drastic turn when it becomes known he is out of jail.This 2010 release from Brazil is rather unique in its characters and plot, presented in a realistic but very colorful and campy atmosphere by a talented filmmaker.  A favorite at many regional and  LGBT film festivals, and won several prizes (including the People's Choice Award) at the 2012 Foreign Press Correspondent Awards.  Not rated, but would be a solid R for sexual content.  In Portuguese with English (also French and Spanish) subtitles, with ""Making of..."" feature and deleted scenes.

"Climb into your literary ""time capsule,"" and journey back to a time when the Stonewall uprising was still a topic of discussion, and Patricia Nell Warren was about to release a groundbreaking gay romance novel called ""The Front Runner.""Originally an essay in New York Times Magazine in 1971, ""On Being Different"" was one of the first books that specifically addressed being gay in (then) modern America, addressing the homophobic stereotypes of that era, as depicted in magazine articles and films of the day. It also provided insight into the work of the Gay Activist Alliance (GAA), a group that began the fight for equal civil rights that - sadly - continue now, more than forty years later.In this reissue edition, the foreword by Dan Savage and the afterword by Charles Kaiser put the late author's work into perspective, as something that has affected their own work as gay authors and activists.  An important and vital addition to your library.

"It's the late 70's, the height of the disco-and-drugs craziness at Manhattan gay clubs. Paul is a thirty something veteran of that scene, now desperately clinging to recovery, a loner, barely surviving day to day on a dead-end job that barely pays enough to get him a room at a residence hotel.One night, he is passing the infamous Studio 54, and lucks out in being able to follow a group past the velvet ropes that would ordinarily have excluded him. In that Disneyland of celebrities, sex and drugs, he manages to meet a kindred spirit.  Adam is about his age, and also a recovering addict.  They make a date to meet a little later, but Adam is found dead at the disco later that evening.  Paul becomes obsessed with finding out who Adam was, and what led him to that stage in his life, likely to better understand his own situation.Other than spinning some memories of those who remember that place and time, this is not a very easy book to read, dealing with a clearly depressed, desperate character, who must make distasteful compromises in order to survive. Beyond that, the writing is fairly good, and it could provide a nice escape for someone who will not be affected by the negativity.  I give it three stars out of five.- Bob Lind, Echo Magazine","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S1MDLT83R5K4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477532153#wasThisHelpful","R3S1MDLT83R5K4","A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like everyone else, gay men are looking for love, whether through traditional romance, or chance encounters that feed one's desire.  Those desires and longings are as varied and diverse as the individuals involved, yet all unite us to some extent.This anthology presents fifteen such stories of longing and desire, written by talented and (mostly) well-known authors of gay male fiction, in styles as different as the focus of each story.  From a story of renegade angels running an exclusive dance club, a tale of how bicycling keeps alive the memory of a good friend, a night out clubbing in ""Gay City,"" and a story involving a unique way to enjoy cake, there is likely something here for every taste.

"Blain Harrington had mixed feelings about bringing along Manny, his Brazilian boyfriend (actually husband, in their home state of Massachusetts), when he decided to attend his 20 year high school reunion in Alabama.  Even in this day and age, he knew the area had more than its share of homophobes as well as racists, and hoped it would not evolve from bigoted comments into a dangerous situation.  His worst fears were realized, when Manny disappeared during the event, likely the victim of violence of some kind.What starts off as a simple mystery is soon revealed to be a unique and highly commendable look at love, relationships, responsibility, friendship and support.  The latter becomes a major focus in the main character dealing with his alcoholism, which has led him into self-destructive behavior as well as occasionally losing his grasp of reality.  It also provides a vital illustration about how well-meaning friends can become enablers, unless the person in recovery can sufficiently distance himself from the group. Most of all, this is a love story with a positive message of hope and belonging.

"Sebastian (Andy Fitzgerald) is a gay man who works for an eccentric lesbian (Mink Stole) as a translator of dead romance languages. He lives with Ida, a straight, agoraphobic nudist (Amy Miles) who, like Sebastian, is unlucky in love, but she also faces the loss of her home ... to a dog ... if she does not find a husband.  She does have an online crush on Hippo, a foreigner she believes may be involved with the Flemish Mafia.  To safeguard Ida's home, Sebastian is willing to marry her, but then meets reclusive Stone, an artist whose presence in his life seems promising.  Got all that?Producer/Director/Screenwriter Kevin Duffy spins a deliciously over-the-top yet unnecessarily complex story, which unfortunately misses its target of being ""campy"" and ventures into being a muddled mess that few will attempt to follow.  Some early sound issues, but otherwise technically good, despite its low budget.  Can't really fault any of the actors, considering what they had to work with; ""Puddles"" the poodle comes across as the star.  Still, it can be a pleasant diversion for a rather short 78 minute run time.  Not rated, but a light R would suffice.  DVD extras include just chapter stops and a trailer.

"The scene is the late 1950's, at the University of Florida.  A self-important state senator, looking to continue Senator McCarthy's now-infamous earlier attempts to root out ""subversives"" in our midst, formed a committee to investigate and expose incidents of communists and homosexuals among the student and faculty of that school.  Before it was over, some of its targets would take their own lives, others would never recover from the devastation to their careers, relationships and sense of self-worth.Based roughly on the real-life Johns Committee with that same agenda, this extremely ambitious novel tells the story through the eyes of those most affected by their actions, the students and faculty themselves.  This is accomplished through detailed character development, which expertly put the reader in the mindset of those individuals, deeply invested in their well-being and the outcome of their ordeals before the committee.  The two main characters, David Ashton  and Stephen Smith, are followed from their boyhood crushes on each other, through a painful separation extended by the emotional toll it took, but eventually both impacted by the committee's activities as young adults.This is an outstanding effort, which reinforces the reader with the innate power of an individual to overcome seemingly impossible adversity, as well as a valuable lesson for younger readers who may be unaware of the impact of homophobia in our society back at that time.

"Diego and Sebastian are two young men who had been good friends when they were young boys, but had not seen each other in some time.  There is an immediate sexual tension between the very shy Diego, who lives with his alcoholic mother, and the more outgoing (and experienced) Sebastian, as they get reacquainted during a lazy summer. Diego is strongly attracted to his friend, and thinks the feeling is mutual, but is too shy to really act on his feelings, despite several opportunities.  Adding a bit of surreal help is Diego's hallucination of a sexy TV pitch-woman, with a hunky male assistant, who periodically appears to him and urges him to act on his feelings and ""enjoy life.""Featured at several gay and international film festivals, this film from Chile is an engaging tale of sexual awakening, in the hands of a capable director, photographer and attractive, talented young cast members.  Explores the often fine line between ""bromance"" and romance, as well as different shades of sexual orientation.  Not rated, but likely would be a soft R for sexual content, though there is no explicit sex or frontal nudity.

"17 year old Tim Cartright decides to do his senior history paper on his father's death in the Gulf War, only to find, once he starts doing research, that there is no record of his father (or anyone else from Kansas) dying in that struggle.  Whenever he gets close to finding out what really happened, a new, seemingly insurmountable roadblock is put in his way, and he starts being followed by someone who identified himself as an FBI agent. His mother is also secretive regarding the details of his father's death, and apparently arranged for Tim to no longer have to do the paper, though his curiosity can't let him stop now.All of this happens during the hectic final months of his senior year in high school, with his girlfriend obsessed with plans for the prom.  As he has since they were little kids, Tim relies heavily on his friend Austin, who has grown into a self-assured young gay man who gets Tim out of some nasty situations. The mystery uncovers his father's notes about UFOs, a war monument that seems to have changed since Tim saw it as a child, and a newspaper story that disappeared from all microfiche and archive copies of that edition.This is a well-conceived, capably written (and directed) emotional story, extremely ambitious for an indie film with a limited budget.  The one negative is some over-acting by several in the cast (including Michael Gordon as Tim, and Danielle Wolverton as his mother), though Mark Ayesh (as Tim's friend Austin) scores a touchdown with a fully-nuanced, engaging character portrayal. There is a surprise ending I was not at all expecting, which is especially rare in a low budget film like this. Don't miss this one.

"In the continuing flood of ""It Gets Better""-type books, meant to give reassurance to gay youth, comes Keith Boykin's excellent anthology of forty-four essays or poems spotlighting diverse gay youth of color.  The selections, from a variety of talented authors,  cross a variety of social and economic levels, and deal with issues as varied as HIV, depression, racism, sexual abuse, as well as simple bigotry against LGBT individuals. It deals with religion and spirituality on several levels, as an area of support but occasionally an excuse for intolerance. The young people portrayed deal with difficult situations that should not be allowed, but manage to find the strength to overcome such adversity.The stories are actually relatable to most LGBT people, regardless of race, and most readers will find a favorite or two that especially hit a note with them (My favorite was ""No Asians, Blacks, Fats or Femmes"" by Indie Harper, which takes on the tiny bigotries that exist in our own community.)

"Dutiful son Maui, academically-gifted but goth-garbed individual Lib, and fabulous cross-dressing Trini are back, as the remaining members of The Mariposa Club, the (supposed to be) Gay/Straight Alliance at their blue collar community high school.  The addition of Sebastian, the son of a wealthy developer, shakes things up a bit, especially for Maui, who immediately develops a crush on the handsome newcomer. They're all seniors this year, and college plans seem to change regularly, but want to make an impact on their school, by insisting that a same-sex couple be allowed to run for King and Queen of the prom.  They're also trying to support Trini, who finds himself once again living with his homophobic and abusive father, but doesn't want anyone to intercede on his behalf, a common reaction some have to being abused.This sequel to the author's ""The Mariposa Club"" (2009) utilizes the same characters, but reading the original is not really necessary for a complete enjoyment of this well-written coming-of-age tale.  The message about Trini's situation is especially valuable here.  Can resonate with gay teens from any close-knit family, regardless of ethnic origin.

"I put this on everyday at some point.  And I definitely wear it when I'm heading out to be active whether biking, jogging or the gym.  I sprained my ankle pretty bad awhile ago.  Tore the tendon and couldn't walk easily for a number of weeks.  Was on crutches and then a cane.  Took about 4 to 6 weeks before I was walking fast again even though still watched what I was doing.  Was able to bike, but jogging was too risky that soon.  About the 4th week it was safe enough to start putting this ankle stabilizer on.  I had tried another one and it didn't work for me.  I stumbled upon this and I'm glad I did.  It's comfortable.  Put your sock on.  Put this stabilizer on.  Then slip your foot right into the shoe with ease with the support on.  No one even notices, unless you're wearing shorts.  It feels secure and safe with this on.  I now just put it on for preventative measures just to ensure nothing happens to my ankle again.  The package only has one so if you want one for both feet, you'll have to place 2 orders.  It takes a few minutes to strap your foot in this.  When you initially receive this it might look a little complicated, but once you put it on a couple of times you nail how to strap it in effortlessly moving forward.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17ECD59MYENHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TGUN7A#wasThisHelpful","R17ECD59MYENHX","AEL6AD2AL2UX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEL6AD2AL2UX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was recently discussing decks on predicting timing with a friend and how there doesn't seem to be one that exists. I went so far as to make my own, but then the ""Angel Answers"" deck arrives. Peeling through it I discovered it's much more than a `yes' or `no' deck. It's also a timing deck! I'm indifferent to the use of predicting timing for myself or others since time is fluid, ever shifting and changeable. We know this, but it doesn't stop us from wanting to know when something will happen. That's where this deck offers some additional help.I've been doing trial tests on others and answering their questions by using this deck. I've found it to be precise and on the mark. I'd say about 10 of the 44 cards in this deck are direct when it comes to timing. The cards that are more exact when it comes to timing have phrases on them such as: In the Near Future, A Year From Now, Not the Right Time, Within the Next Few Months, Perfect Timing, Within the Next Few Weeks, Unlikely, If you Believe, Perfect Timing.This deck is great to use when you need a quick answer on something or would like to get as close to accurate timing as you can. You want to get straight to the point. Keep in mind that you will not always pick a card which points to exactly when something will begin to surface. There might be additional messages that need to be followed in order for something to come to fruition.The cards are easy to shuffle and easy on the eyes. They're bright with a ton of gold and violet popping at you. The images are of angels, saints and other brilliant lights. It struck me much like when you go to those fun, novelty ""fortune telling"" machines with a gypsy fortune teller's head in the box. A card pops out with a little fortune on it. Except these images are of colorful spirit lights peering at you in most of them.There is a card that says, ""Yes"" and one that says, ""Yes!"" As well as a card that says, ""No"" and one that says, ""No!"" If you receive a plain old ""Yes"" or ""No"" card, then it's a soft yes or no. You could technically ask for additional information in another card as to why something is a yes or no. However, you get a card with an exclamation point that says, ""Yes!"" or ""No!"" - then you have a firm response. There is no need to dig further.There are also words on the cards such as, ""No need to worry"", meaning don't obsess over when something is going to happen. All will work out the way it is intended. It will happen, but be patient and have faith that it will. I recently experienced a bad ankle sprain due to a rock climbing accident. I consulted these cards to ask how it's going.  I pulled the ""Improving Health"" card.  I was born with heightened clairaudience, so hearing which card to flip over translates to me constantly flipping over the correct card.  Some of the other cards that exist in this deck are: Romance, Let Go, Reconsider, Compromise, Choose a New Direction, Meditation Brings Answers, Don't Stop, Get More Information, Recovery.I was guided to pull three cards from this deck for someone wanting to know when her boyfriend was going to move out of his residence. The cards pulled from this deck were, ""Take Action"", ""You're Ready"" and ""Ask for help from others"". Reading those three cards you can likely assess how this will go. They did not give me timing or say that it wasn't going to happen. It would happen if the guy does something about it (Take Action). He does need to move and can no longer be in the living situation he's in (You're ready). But he will not be able to do it on his own (Ask for help from others). As it turns out, the guy is working with someone who is looking for a new residence for him. He is unable to move out on his own. If he doesn't follow these steps, then it won't happen according to the messages in the spread.I've been using this deck obsessively since I received it. I've found it to be a ton of fun. You don't need to be an experienced reader to use this deck. This will work beautifully for some as it does for me, and not so much for others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H0JA5TMAXLKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401945902#wasThisHelpful","R2H0JA5TMAXLKO","AEL6AD2AL2UX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEL6AD2AL2UX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The three main actors emerged themselves into these interesting characters on a narcissistic ride.  There is Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who has a daily addiction to porn and admits he loves it more than sex with the real thing.  Why?  Because as he says, ""he loses himself"", whereas with the real thing he seems to just be going through the motions feeling nothing.  That is until he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), who makes him work for it, or I should say makes him work for her.  She's what he considers a 10 on the scale of the meat market.  Barbara loves all things romance and feels that if a guy really likes her, then he'll succumb to her allure and give her whatever she demands.  Jon forgets who he is and falls even further into addiction and unhappiness as he bows down to whatever Barbara requests, that is until he meets Esther (Julianne Moore) and older beautiful woman who is much more down to earth and understanding.  Esther manages to teach Jon how to finally lose himself and in this process, find himself.  This was an interestingly funny and at times dramatic movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.  It is bathed in nudity and foul language so if that's not your cup of tea, then you might want to rent ""You've Got Mail"" instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L74ZT1DYM4ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRILRW0#wasThisHelpful","R3L74ZT1DYM4ID","AEL6AD2AL2UX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEL6AD2AL2UX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm surprised I haven't left a review here by now considering that I seem to be listening to this album more than several times a week.  I must like Katy Perry.  This album is really inspiring I've found.  It's deeper than her previous cotton candy Teenage Dream album.  Much different even though they are both good depending on what you're in the mood for.  The first half of the album is likely considered the radio friendly half, but it's the second half of the album that is considerably deeper and some of her best work on this particular album and maybe her career to date.  ""Ghost"", ""Love Me"", ""This Moment"" and ""Double Rainbow"" are clearly tracks geared towards the way her Ex-husband left her.""Ghost"" touches on that with painful emotion as she explains how the guy basically texted her that he was filing for divorce and she never heard from him again.  In ""Love Me"" she moves into accepting herself and loving herself in a way that she had hoped he could love her.  With, ""This Moment"", ""Double Rainbow"" and ""Spiritual"", she climbs out of the painful hole of her relationship ending and empowers herself to take charge of her life and thus finding love with someone who fulfills her in a much bigger way than her ex could've.  For that matter, if you're experiencing a painful break up, this album might be just therapeutic enough to help you forge on and feel a sense of optimism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWVWAGE8X2JY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ERIUO02#wasThisHelpful","RWVWAGE8X2JY0","AEL6AD2AL2UX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEL6AD2AL2UX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish I could unsee this.  The Dexter series as a whole gets five stars, but the final season gets 2 stars.  Disappointing and manipulative.  I hate it when writers, studios and entertainment people decide to get sloppy just because it's the final season.  They end up making their final season against what made the entire series so popular to begin with.  The Dexter makers were trying to do something ridiculously poignant and they failed with this one.  I couldn't stop laughing at the constant absurdity that they were guiding the characters to follow.  Of course all of the characters are made to be totally out of character.  It didn't work.

I made it through it mumbling at the audacity of events that take place in this story. The whole tone is manipulative. The screenwriter basically made the characters do things that regular people would never ever do. They had to write it that way or there wouldn't have been a movie! I didn't hate this as I've seen worse, but I didn't care for it either. I watched it once and will forget all about it in a month.

I was pleasantly surprised.  The entire cast was fantastic, but especially the two lead women, Michelle Pfeiffer and Dianna Agron.  Robert DeNiro is always good.

Not only were the filmmakers accurate about the paranormal stuff, but they managed to be entertaining without selling out the way most Hollywood movies do in this sort of genre.  The film is interesting and with a great story while serving up the thrills on an entertainment level.  This movie is scary to begin with and even scarier with the lights out.

"I never thought I would ever like a Miley Cyrus album, but this one is it.  I was never a Miley fan, but I had heard of her and heard a song here and there on the radio.  I was not impressed much to buy anything of hers.  I always thought of her as some teeny-bopper disney pop princess type.  Not anymore.  Every track on this CD is fun including the bonus tracks on the deluxe edition.  Her voice is really quite good.  She's got some strong pipes developing.  It'll be interesting to see what other music she evolves into later in her career.  Despite the controversy surrounding her performance at the music awards, which I was indifferent to, focusing on the music she doesn't need to do any of those antics.  The music on this album is attention enough.  Did you notice the album cover looks like a Pat Benatar record from the Eighties?

"This is an understated slow paced Woody Allen film.  I love Woody Allen and most of his films.  This one isn't quite as good as some of my other favorites of his like ""Husbands and Wives"", ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" or ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"", but it's a nice, little art piece.  ""Shadows and Fog"" seems to he heavy on the atmosphere and less so in the actual dialogue and script.  I'm sure that's only slightly unusual considering that Woody Allen excels in those areas.  He got some pretty big names to star in this too like John Malkovich, Jodie Foster, Madonna, John Cusack, Lily Tomlin, Kathy Bates and Donald Pleasance.  They're all underutilized, but again the draw of this film is the ambiance Woody creates over anything else.

"This is one of my all time favorite Woody Allen films.  It's a very dark film dealing with heavy issues, but its not dark as in depressing.  Dark as in brutally truthful in a comedic way.  The language is probably the harshest in any Woody Allen film.  Lots of profanity laced throughout so if that bothers you, then you won't like this.  I personally loved it and not because of that.  It serves a purpose.  I love the mini-vignettes about human relationships and how they weave effortlessly with one another.I've been trying to get this on DVD for years.  I'm certainly not going to pay $90.00 for a movie which is what they're currently charging for this.  It hasn't been re-released and there's no information as to why.  In any case, I will keep checking, but this is definitely one of Woody Allen's best according to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YQLG8M2Y26KF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0780622243#wasThisHelpful","R1YQLG8M2Y26KF","AEL6AD2AL2UX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEL6AD2AL2UX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second in the series of the Jurassic Park movies.  The visual effects and the dinosaurs are life like.  The movie is a roller coaster ride and I rather enjoyed it, mostly to see more Jurassic Park stuff.  Julianne Moore and Jeff Goldblum do well with what they have to work with.  This is where the negative comes in.  And this is surrounding the screenplay which is formulaic and manipulative.  Whoever wrote this script basically created far fetched and outlandish things to happen simply to turn this into a big chase monster movie.  Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching this for the way it looked and the tone.  My only complaint is in the story.For example, the screenwriter has the Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughan character steal a baby Tyrannosaurus Rex who is hurt so they can nurse it back to health.  Well any bright person who knows about dinosaurs as these characters allegedly should have, would know that the mother is going to come looking for it and will be very angry.  And that's what happens.  An attack staged by the screenwriter simply to shoot it in a mobile home dangling from a cliff.  This goes on forever.  The other manipulation was in creating a daughter for Jeff Goldblum who sneaks on the boat that's taking him to the island where these dinosaurs are.  Of course once she's there, she's kicking herself for doing that since dinosaurs are chasing them.  You hardly feel much sympathy for her or the other two characters that stole the Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Of course there is a corporation on the island with them so that this main guy can bring a T-rex to the states.  Then the Godzilla part of the monster movie begins.The most shocking thing about this film is that this is a film directed by Steven Spielberg.  He's a genius film director, but it baffles me that he thought this wasn't the least bit contrived.  He wanted to make a monster movie instead of really getting to know these dinosaurs and that's where his focus was for this.  Monsters.  Chasing.  Death.  We know less about the dinosaurs by the end of the second movie and more about movie manipulation.  Regardless of all that, this movie is watchable and well done with what they all had to work with.  I just wish there was more focus on creating a realistic story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LRMVLZQRV5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087ZG7NO#wasThisHelpful","R2LRMVLZQRV5Q","AEL6AD2AL2UX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEL6AD2AL2UX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book for ""beginner guitarists"" works well on my Kindle, BlackBerry and computer. The photos are clear, and the illustrations are large enough to be seen. Wonderful!That being said, however, there are some omissions which should be addressed and some corrections to be made as well.I think that when an author bills his work as being for ""beginners"", he/she should assume that ""beginners"" might encompass all stages of knowledge, from never-strummed-a-chord, to people who aren't quite intermediate players but don't need help with these chords. That being said, I find it disconcerting that there is no indication as to which strings should be strummed or omitted. If a beginner learns to simply strum all the strings when playing these chords, than he/she is learning a bad lesson, one which is difficult to correct once ingrained. The author should give a mention to string and finger numbering, as well as standard X's and O's to indicate which strings to play.I also feel that ""rating"" chords is detrimental to beginning guitarists, as it predisposes them to work on the ""easy"" ones and bypass the ones labeled ""hard"".There is a problem with the Fm chord photo vs illustration, which has been pointed out by another reviewer but not corrected as of yet. Additionally, the first sentence on the welcome page states that the book contains ""all the tabs you will need to practice your guitar theory"". Perhaps he meant to say ""chords"", because there are no true ""tabs"" represented in this book.Hopefully the author will see fit to make some corrections and additions to the guide and do a bit of editing as well.Finally, there are two sexes on this planet, male and female. I think it is unnecessary for the author to suggest that his male readers will become babe magnets by using his guide. Honestly, does he actually believe that guys begin playing guitar for the sole purpose of getting laid??? Where does that leave women guitarists? Do they fall in love with themselves??Suggestions: Drop the sexist comments, address the book to beginners by making sure you are teaching them correctly from the start, fix your errors and...you will have a 5 star book. As it stands, 2 1/2 stars is all it rates.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37C5WXU28JN81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W3L3L6#wasThisHelpful","R37C5WXU28JN81","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, now that I have finished reading this one I am faced with a dilemma; how to accurately convey the brilliance found amongst the rubble.The story revolves around the protagonist who has a business which involves driving from state to state, stopping in cities along the way to purchase items from pawn shops (mostly video games and guitars) which he then sells, online, as he goes. He has a proclivity for beer, babes and burgers and is an ex-psychology major who doles out little bits of insight to people he meets along the way.  He is also an accomplished guitarist who enjoys playing at ""open mic"" events.  Nothing wrong to this point, the premise is plausible, the idea somewhat unique and the underlying story strangely compelling.  If I had to knock any part of this so far, it would be that the story was easily 30% longer than necessary, but somehow the author managed to pull it off.So we move along to the reason for my two-star rating, which is simple. This book is so poorly written that it is difficult to find a page which doesn't have at least one error.  Incorrect spelling, major grammatical gaffes, sentences that weren't, contradictions, incongruity, omissions, disagreement between nouns and verbs...and the list goes on and on and... It was freakin' maddening. It seemed like the author published the absolute roughest of rough drafts without the benefit of ANY proofing or editing.  Therein lies the conundrum; for in the midst of this frustrating, almost incomprehensible mess resides the underlying story, one which compels the reader to push on... I always read the entirety of a book before I comment on it and, believe me, that can be a painful process.  Amazingly though, every time I put this one down in disbelief over what I had just subjected myself to, I found myself inextricably drawn back to it...I just had to know how things would turn out.For the life of me, I can't understand how an author will take the time to write a book and then not finish his work with competent proofing and editing. To me, it shows a lack of respect for oneself--not to mention for the readers and, indeed, for the creation itself. This guy really had an opportunity here and, in my opinion, he just flat out blew it.  Indeed, he basically forfeited his credibility for this and any future writing he may do.I would love to recommend this book, but in fairness to potential readers, I just can't.  There is a caveat to that last statement; if you are willing to wade through a book (which is so rife with errors it's staggering) while overlooking the detritus in the hopes of finding nuggets within, you have my blessings.The author would be best served by yanking this one, finding himself a professional editor to literally rewrite it and then have it republished.  He's got nothing to lose and everything to gain by doing so.I hated it, and in the same breath, I actually liked it.  I'm just not certain that anyone with a modicum of understanding of the English language will be willing to sacrifice their sanity (as I did) to plow through this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ATIKDQZZ9PKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2YMP66#wasThisHelpful","R2ATIKDQZZ9PKW","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is number three of the ""How To Read Music For Guitar"" series, and as such I gotta say that ""three, possibly, is the charm"". What I mean by that is, I feel it would be in the learner's best interest to start with Book One and move cohesively through the series. This book made me feel like there were some things I had missed and, as such, it seemed a bit more complicated than necessary. For the most part, all the illustrations were formatted and usable on the Kindle until, perhaps, the last quarter of the book--and then things went, somewhat, awry. The illustrations became difficult to read in places and lost focus when zoomed. I don't know if this problem presents itself in the other two books or not.I was able to come away with usable knowledge after reading this book, but I think things would gel if I read the series...perhaps more than once...or twice, truth be told.I obtained this book when it was offered on a free list, and I am glad I did.

"This little book about snakes contains some very nice photos coupled with short and, in many cases, poorly written text. I hope parents are reading this to their children correctly and not verbatim. Perhaps the author should employ an editor before she attempts to ""teach"" children about snakes with good pictures and bad english/grammar. Need an example? This is from the Description and contains an error in each of the two sentences in this paragraph: ""There are also picture captions, which provides more information to talk about with your child. Alternatively, a child of any age (even the child in you) can just look at the images and appreciate its beauty"".

"Looking for a minimalist piece of work?  You've found it.  This is a book of guitar chords and almost nothing else.  There is an active table of contents. That's GREAT!  The chord representations are formatted perfectly and are easy to read on a standard Kindle, Kindle phone app. or computer.  BRAVO!  The book is billed as ""beginner"" yet there isn't a shred of instruction, no ""key"", for the beginner to understand the whole picture. That's BAD!There is a serious problem which the author needs to address, correct and republish his revisions through Amazon.  The TOC starts with C chords but the first four chords depicted are actually the  G and G6 chords.  The next page picks back up with C chords but omits the C and C6 set.  That could cause problems for the beginner. This needs to be taken care of ASAP. Perhaps something got left out at the beginning since my kindle showed a jump in percentage from 1-23 with nothing but the TOC, copyright, title and author between those locations.Additionally, I think it would be helpful if the author were to include a ""key page"" which explains all the numbers and symbols used in reference to playing a chord.  Yes, I understand that most guitarists already know what the representations mean and how to read them...but, remember when you didn't?  I feel this addition would make the book a tad more user friendly.There's no need to worry about lousy writing in this offering because there is no text...just chords, chords and more chords.  I'm good with that!In any event, if the author were to correct these issues and update the corrections through Amazon, so that the update will apply to previously purchased edition's, I would rate this 5 stars.

"This is a book of ""life lessons"" from Walt Disney that the author writes about,  but apparently doesn't incorporate into this short book.  From the first sentence in the introduction to the last page of the conclusion, you get horribly crafted sentences, errors, omissions and writing which is juvenile at best. I'm sorry, but when the introductory sentence reads: ""Who hasn't heard of Disneyland, the place that has been said as the happiest place on Earth"", you should immediately know what awaits you as you read further. When the second sentence reads: ""Who didn't know Cinderella, or Snow White, or Sleeping Beauty?"" I am left to wonder...is that a ""biblical sense"" question?Walt Disney was, and is, an American icon, the kind of man we need more of today. He deserves better than this compilation of short, badly written blurbs which have been thrown together in the hopes of making a buck.Honestly, this book is somewhat billed as a self help book patterned after some of the principles Walt Disney believed in and lived by. He did so with no apologies and no compromises. One of his core beliefs was ""quality should never be compromised"".  Another core value Walt Disney held dear was ""exceed your customer's expectations"". Unfortunately, this book fails miserably in terms of living up to or incorporating these beliefs into this product.  I don't appreciate it, and I imagine Walt wouldn't either.The idea behind the book is good but the execution is dreadful.

"If you like hassles, you're gonna love this one.Sorry to say it but this book doesn't work well on my Kindle. I'll rundown a list of problems I have with using it.1- The text and illustrations are displayed in light gray rather than black which makes them difficult to see when playing.2- The text is tiny which means you have to resize it after you have highlighted and zoomed the page. Setting the value to ""actual size"" works best.3- Once you have jumped through these hoops, be prepared to repeat them over and over as you move from page to page.4- You need to set your orientation to landscape rather than portrait. Fortunately, the page remains in landscape once changed. Unfortunately, you have to reset the value when you move from this book to another. I guess you could leave it in landscape forever but I never see anybody using a kindle reader in that orientation. It is your choice however.5- The book could use a once-over for errors.All of the things combine to make this book way less than user friendly.

I got it from a free list but had I paid for it, I would be PO'd.Hopefully, the author will use these tips to revamp his product so that his readers have a user friendly learning tool which displays correctly on their kindle.As it stands now, it rates two stars.

"Yesterday, I experienced something which delighted my sense of sight in a way I found almost overwhelming.  It was the discovery and exploration of two different books of photographs, shot in two completely different mediums, color and black and white.  The first book ""Garish: Roadside Color Polaroids"" by Robert Jones absolutely blew me away with its astonishingly vivid photographs.  I reviewed that book and received a very nice comment from the author as well as a heads up that his book ""Looking Down"" was also available, gratis.  Let's just say I wasted no time in adding it to my kindle.  If you have the chance, pick both of these up; they are an eye opening experience.What a completely different set of photographs ""Looking Down"" contains.  Shot in black and white in Boston's Hyde Park, these photos are close up and in your face.  There are no broad sweeping vistas, no vivid colors, nothing to remind you that these photos were created by the same artist, Robert Jones.  In this book you find out what shading and shadows lend to a picture.  You discover contrast and depth and you begin to notice that these photos portray things you ""see"" everyday, and yet never see at all.  Little metal covers set in sidewalks, or manhole covers in the streets, steps, handrails, detritus, weeds, grass, signs, buildings...things which go to make up a life and yet are relegated to inconsequential status by our busy minds.  Many of the photos contain no frame of reference, a tactic which elicits a curiosity response and draws you into the shot more deeply as your mind works to understand what your eyes are seeing.  Textures, graininess, shadows and light meld with lines and angles which invite you to touch, explore. They offer no physical tactility yet create a virtual one so realistic, you do feel it.Perhaps I am drawn to the photographs in these two books by what they portray, but don't show...people.  In reality, there are people represented in each building, sidewalk, sign and bit of trash, but there are no ""people"" present for the camera. This isn't a study of road maps on a farmer's face but it is, very much, a study of who we are and what we create.  The photographs in these two books are snippets of life, captured thoughtfully and creatively in black and white or vivid color;  they are soulful representations of us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RC4M03A0SXM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095OB6CS#wasThisHelpful","R2RC4M03A0SXM6","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the movie Christine there is this utterance, ""you can't polish a turd"" yet this photographer seems to have done just that by turning his photos, taken on a Polaroid ""instant"" camera, into something almost otherworldly.  For most ""serious"" photographers the thought of using a Polaroid in an attempt to create art is simply laughable, yet here are photos which are stunning in many respects and are definitely ""art"".  John DeFore is dead on the money when he describes these shots by stating, ""The colorpack's vision is close enough to our own to feel like something we might have seen ourselves - years ago, maybe, when the light was just so"".  That assessment is profound for its accuracy in describing the feeling one gets when looking at these photographs.  It's like stepping into a visual time machine which the photographer created with his skill, his camera and film and, of course, his choice of subjects.  Brilliant, simply brilliant!My only gripe, and subsequent reason for my four star vote, is due to the doubling up of photos in the John DeFore section.  Since the text wasn't, for the most part, describing specific photos, it seems that additional shots could have been used. Other than that, this one is five stars all the way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZFAS0KHOI6GL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096DIIX8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZFAS0KHOI6GL","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's get one thing straight right off the bat. Just because it's porn in book form doesn't make it any different than watching porn on a computer. I say that because both of the protagonists in this story were guiltily fulfilling their fantasies through porn rather than engaging in those fantasies with one another. Up until then this book is ok, but once it began alluding to nipple clamps, giant dildos, and whacking each other around, I began to lose interest.Apparently, this author incorporates BDSM into most, if not all, of her stories and because of that I most likely won't be reading any more of them. It would have been helpful if the author had seen fit to accurately describe this book but what you think you'll get and what you actually end up with are two different critters. Hey, I don't give a rats a#* what other folks do to one another where sex is concerned. Really, if you or your partner enjoy whips and chains and find moderate or even extreme torture exciting or pleasurable...have at it. I just don't need that in my life. It is interesting to note the push to ""mainstream"" BDSM, SM and other less discussed aspects of human sexuality via the current plethora of stories with that bent. Interesting as well as disconcerting. Hell, maybe I ought to head for home right now and whip the little lady into a frenzy...or perhaps not.In any event, if you are looking for a primer before you decide to act out your fantasy, you may have found it in this one.

"I love  Christmas stories but...I don't love poorly written, highly repetitive, grammatical nightmares which masquerade as serious Christmas stories. Look, what you have here is a decent tale which is, unfortunately, destroyed by lousy storytelling. This story reads like a first attempt rough draft rather than a somewhat polished piece of literature. My suggestion to the author: Take this book out of sales circulation for now and ask a number of people (preferably not friends or family) to read it and make comments about it. Rewrite the book using suggestions from the folks you asked to read it. Get yourself a professional editor and follow his/her advice. Hopefully, you will come away with a better product, one which is a pleasure to read. This really could be a charming little story but as it's written now, it's almost laughable.

"This review is going to be short and sweet, as I just finished this book (#1 in a trilogy/series) and I can't wait to start book two!  Seriously, this book is one hell of a way to start off; and if the other two are in the same league as this one, I'll be one happy camper.  Written in first-person narrative, this ""book one"" introduces the characters and familiarizes the reader with Viet Nam in 1968-9...not a particularly good time to visit.  The protagonist, Hamilton ""Hamfist"" Hancock, is a believable, likable guy who is serving honorably with the Air Force at DeNang.  He pilots a small twin engine plane, the O-2A, and is an FAC, forward air controller, a guy who puts his ass on the line to locate targets and coordinate the attacks on those targets from the air.  These pilots flew low and slow and were vulnerable to even small arms fire on occasion.  I'm not giving you more of an overview of this book because there is no need; other reviewers and the description have done that for me.  Let it suffice to say that if you want a tight, belivable portrayal of day-to-day life in a free fire zone in Viet Nam, it doesn't get much better than this.  Although the description clearly let's you know, I'm gonna spell it out for you...this is not a stand alone book, unless you like books with no closure.  Got it?  Good!Okay, my job is done.  I hope you read this one...I'm off to start book two.

"As I read this short story, I began asking myself if the author was, perhaps, being paid by the page to write it. She seemed to have a handle on this one but then it started to get away from her.  The basic premise and core of the story was good;  it didn't need all the extra complications.Javier is a likable guy and although Teresa has some issues, she is likable as well. Teresa's problems with her son and daughter are introduced early on but are never really explored. Instead, what begins to happen is that a series of insecurity issues are introduced coupled with new players who (IMHO) just don't need to be there. The book could have been wrapped up much earlier without all of the additional contrived drama which felt like filler designed to stretch the story out. Sorry, but the best I can give this one is three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LXWYM8OUUXME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZCU8IE#wasThisHelpful","R2LXWYM8OUUXME","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short book is as much a sales tool for the author as it is a learning tool for you.  I am no guitar expert, so any information I can pickup which helps me better my playing has value; hence, my three star vote.  The troubles with this little book are two-fold.  There is a problem with the teaching, and there are major problems with how this book works on a Kindle reader.First, what I consider to be a problem with the lesson:  I believe that a book like this might better address itself to ALL learners if it included finger numbering.  Now you might say, ""Duh! Everybody knows about that."" Really???  Think back to when YOU didn't know about which fingers to use...wouldn't that info have helped you then?  If you already know it, then skip over it; but if you don't, you aren't going to learn it here. In addition to what I consider (IMHO) to be that oversight, there is one complete illustration which is upside-down (location 349).My second problem with this book concerns how usable it is/isn't in a Kindle format. Unfortunately, I gotta say it is marginal at best.  Some of the illustrations are TINY and lose focus when zoomed.  Some are very light in color making them difficult to read while playing.  This problem is not exclusive to this book; I find that many guitar related books aren't very user friendly on a Kindle.  Someone should figure out how to correct that problem so that all guitar books show up better on Kindle.Now for a pet peeve of mine:  There is good information to be had here but it is coupled with a fairly strong push by the author to ""click this link and buy my book which will address that issue"".  Perhaps a little less selling would be in order here.  The listing at the end is more than adequate in getting the point across without interrupting the learning process. 'Nuff said on that ""score"".All in all this short instructional book contains some good info; it just doesn't translate into a user friendly format on the Kindle.  Still, at a price point of zero (what I paid), it is one to add to your arsenal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M056KHIRLRZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCR0K0A#wasThisHelpful","R1M056KHIRLRZZ","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's get right to the crux of the matter, shall we?  This is a book about  kombucha which falls short of being worthwhile in so many ways.  First and foremost, I gotta ask...do words mean anything anymore or are books just thrown together with little or no proofing or editing?  Case in point: the author is touting the benefits of using kombucha by calling it ""infamous"" and ""notorious"".  Neither of these two words are correct, as both mean about the same thing and it isn't ""good"" it's ""bad"".  I just can't look at a book like this and deem it credible when it is swimming in errors which are so blatantly obvious you couldn't miss them if you tried; and yet there they are, emblazoned on the pages like love bugs on a windshield.  Misspelled words, words used incorrectly, errors, omissions, contradictions and the list goes on and on. What a mess!Additionally, while the book does include some good information, it leaves out important information as well.  You might have questions such as:  ""What is the preferred temperature range for brewing kombucha?"" or ""What does SCOBY stand for?"" or ""How do I test for PH?"" or ""Okay, you mentioned some names of acids and cultures found in the tea, what are they good for???""  Don't hold your breath waiting for the answers to questions like these (or the many others you might come up with) because you won't find them in this book.The title and some text of the book (location 199 for example) are misleading in that they imply/state that the book contains RECIPES (plural meaning more than one) for making kombucha.  WRONG!  There is only one recipe for making kombucha in this book, all the other recipes use kombucha in the mix. Tsk, tsk, tsk.Sorry, but when you add it all up, there just isn't enough to like in this little ditty to give it any more than two stars.  Better books on the subject of making and using kombucha are readily available.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZNFTQZ3YP6G8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BL52B7I#wasThisHelpful","R1ZNFTQZ3YP6G8","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the description as well as many of the reviews before I got this one so I was aware that the book would have a decided Christian bent to it.  I don't normally read books in the Christian genre but I decided to give this one a try because of the WWII aspect.The book is initially written from the perspective of young Traugott Vogel, son of a high ranking Nazi SS officer.  It is interesting to read his recollections of being in the Hitler youth movement, his indoctrination into the Nazi mindset and his absolute belief that Hitler and Germany were doing the right thing.  His hatred of the British and Americans is venomous, especially when he gets a first hand look at ""Allied justice"" in the form of bombing raids against Germany.  It is apparent that the Nazi propaganda machine was working well up until just before the war ended.  Hitler's Germany was killing people by the millions and being lauded as heroes by the German people for doing so, yet the Allies became the ""bombing murderers"" in Traugott's mind as the tides of war shifted.  Luckily, after the occupation by American forces, the German people were treated with more respect than was perhaps deserved once the atrocities of the Nazi regime were uncovered.  Although there was still hatred and animosity on both sides, the spirit of America reached out and touched this confused young man and led him from the dark to the light.  Outstanding so far, right? Right.The story goes on to expound on Traugott's conversion to Christianity, and from that point on I could take it or leave it.  I imagine that as a testament to his belief that his conversion was miraculous, the book does what it was written to do.  I read it cover to cover and I must say, I was far more interested in the insights into the German mindset of the time than I was in reading what amounted to career decisions as the book progressed.For those of you looking for a fairly unique portrayal of the German mindset during WWII, this book will give you that and more.  Those looking for an uplifting account of God working in strange and mysterious ways will enjoy this one as well.  If, however, you are adamantly opposed to reading what amounts to a testimonial about one man's conversion to Christianity...perhaps this one isn't for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RC4WI1WXSX2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Q9EZSW#wasThisHelpful","R1RC4WI1WXSX2Q","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Phew!  This is an exhaustive study of the oft maligned Sherman tank, a tank which was deemed ""good enough"" when all was said and done.  The book looks at not only American Armor in WWII but also French, German, British and others both Allied and Axis.  It undertakes comparative descriptions showing the strengths and weaknesses of all differing types.  It includes detailed information on anti-tank weapons, both mechanized and non, and discusses their attributes (or lack thereof).  The book is filled with pictures which portray the Sherman and other armor throughout the development and testing stages as well as under battle conditions in theaters throughout the world.  I am not a military historian and certainly don't have the knowledge that many of the esteemed reviewers of this book possess but, regardless, I found this to be an incredibly thorough examination of the venerable yet maligned Sherman tank.  I give this one a solid 4 1/2 stars (boldly displayed to avoid strafing by Allied aircraft).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHV5M7YSN8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094B19K6#wasThisHelpful","R1DHV5M7YSN8N","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this one up this morning from the top 100 free list and, I gotta admit, I liked it.  This short tale isn't long enough for great character building but both of the protagonists are likable.  The authors don't make Trip out to be unbelievably masculine, nor is  Karen your typical ""supermodel"" beauty.  That's kind of refreshing, don't you think?  The storyline, while not new or unique, is believable and fairly well written.  There are some errors and omissions which could be cleaned up with editing but, thankfully, the story is not rife with mistakes.  The sex scenes are steamy and you can obviously feel the chemistry between the two lovers.  You find yourself rooting for the expected HEA but that doesn't happen, at least not in this story.

"Here's another in a flood of books about vinegar, although this author takes a different tact.  This book, and many like it, address uses for apple cider vinegar, but this book also talks about using ACV or white vinegar based on the type of need.  The author does not make outrageous, unsubstantiated claims, and she does give some citations.  She is also adamant in her ""talk to your doctor BEFORE you begin using vinegar for health related issues"" stance.  Cudos to her for that. I take umbrage with her opening statement that vinegar has been used ""for millions of years for health and beauty"".  I believe the generally accepted number is more in the neighborhood of 10,000 years.  In addition to inaccurate statements like this one, the book has its share of errors and omissions which could be corrected with editing.All in all there is some decent information to be had here.

The author has put together two stories in this one book.  They parallel one another although they take place years apart.  Both are well written; and though I wasn't surprised by what took place in either story, I was taken aback by how they effected me emotionally.  Randy Mixter has an affinity for telling great love stories, and he has written two winners in this one book.If you like good love stories and or stories with a paranormal bent, you can't go wrong with this one.

"This is a fairly well written little read which reverses the traditional stereotypes portrayed in many books of this genre.  The author has you thinking about the concept of ""lust"" within the confines of a committed relationship.  As a man who has never believed the adage that ""it will never be better than the first time"", I found it refreshing to find a male protagonist fighting for a relationship rather than sex.  There really are guys like this out there, and this book highlights that truth.As an aside, there are also some pretty hot sex scenes to be found in this one...wink-wink-nudge-nudge.This is a quick read and it contains some errors and omissions, but overshadowing the flaws is the truth inherent within...there is NOTHING which compares to the love/lust/sex found between two caring, committed lovers.So there you have it, a little fantasy, a little truth, a little reality, and a little sex all wrapped up in a neat little package for your enjoyment.  I give this one 4 1/2 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2CX611RJE6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OYI2SO#wasThisHelpful","R2D2CX611RJE6G","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Just one"" is a startlingly well written novella in which the author introduces, and nicely develops, her primary characters to love (or hate).  There is quite a bit of sexy fun packed into this story which, coupled with witty dialogue and a bit of intrigue, creates a tale compelling enough to make you want to read on.

"I read and reviewed ""The Ultimate Guide to Witch Hazel"" which is another Dynamite Books publication; and like that book, this one is filled with ambiguity, conjecture, contradiction, poor writing and a total lack of formal citations.  In my humble opinion, I don't appreciate books like this which tout numerous unproven medicinal uses for things like witch hazel or tea tree oil yet provide no background on the qualifications of the author(s), their sources or formal citations for the ""studies"" mentioned.  This book's witch hazel section is, for the most part, the same as ""The Ultimate Guide..."" book I previously reviewed. The section on tea tree oil gives warnings on the dangers associated with use of this product...thank God for that!  If you think about what you are reading here you begin to see patterns develop.  For example: statements such as, ""...experiments have PROVEN that tea tree oil is effective against fungus..."" make you think ""okay, maybe I'll use it for that"", yet six sentences later comes (paraphrasing here for brevity) tests conducted to determine  the effectiveness of tea tree oil on athlete's foot had results which were ""not clear"".  Now let's see, athlete's foot is caused by fungus...Hummm???  You find these types of  contradictory statements throughout the book.  The very next sentence states that ""tea tree oil has often been referred to, as a healer of all ailments"".  Really?  By whom?  And does ""all ailments"" really mean ALL???  Call me stupid, but the book states that ""tea tree oil is very toxic if ingested"", sooo... how is it going to help with ailments like stomach ulcers or internal medical problems if you can't ingest it?  If it ""heals everything"", does that mean you can cure a sty by putting it in your eye?  Can you cure intestinal cancer without ingesting it and if so, how...by rubbing it behind your ears???  Honestly, if you read the book you will see that there are many fantastic claims made, but other than casual mention there are NO FORMAL CITATIONS given for any of the ""it has been proven"" statements in this book.  What you really get here are anecdotes, conjecture, ambigous statements, unproven ""proof"", smoke and mirrors and...well I hope you get the point.Look, I use or have used all four of these ""magical potions"" but I'm not buyin' the miraculous claims  made in this book or others of its ilk.  Why?  Because these claims are, for the most part, unsubstantiated and unproven.  Think about it, if you have a vaginal yeast infection, are you really going to coat a tampon with vaseline, apply tea tree oil to it and insert into this very delicate area???  Are you willing to believe that ""in olden times, coconut and its oil have been an effective CURE for tumors, typhoid, swelling, sypillis, toothache, tuberculosis, ulcers, upset stomach, weakness and many more diseases""?  If that is the case, why did millions die of many of these diseases before the advent of vaccinations and true antibiotics???  Insanity and ultimately death was the only proven ""cure"" for sypillis before true antibiotics were discovered.I'm in no way saying that none of these products have value, but the claims of proof, magical properties and cures for disases which have killed and continue to kill millions of people around the world just don't hold water for me.  In addition, writing a book which is filled with typos, omissions, misspellings, misused words and a plethora of other problems lends little to its credibility.I'm giving this one 1 1/2 stars because there are a few tidbits of information to be found here, and in this book, the author did a better job of warning the reader about potential or actual problems associated with the use of these products.  I realize that many conventional doctors are not always big proponents of alternative medicine, but you should certainly discuss the use of products like these with him/her before you begin.  After all, 100% organic grapefruit juice (for example) just has to be GREAT for you, right?  Not always.  Study the internet, Web M.D., The Mayo Clinic and other agencies both governmental and private for PROOF (with citations) about grapefruit juice's negative interaction with medicines. Just because it's ""organic or natural"" doesn't mean it can't hurt you.  (I'm not slamming grapefruit juice here, I'm simply using it as a verifiable example, thanks).","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WZEXLUBZFNYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EN2DOGS#wasThisHelpful","R2WZEXLUBZFNYL","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fairly well written book which gives the reader valuable insight into preserving vegetables through fermentation rather than pickling.  The book goes over the ""whys"" and ""hows"" of the process and also contains tips and recipes.  There are a few errors and omissions but I found them to be less distracting than the author's willingness to be redundant...perhaps as a way to stretch the book.  In any event, I found the subject matter to be presented clearly, interestingly and compellingly so I think I will give it a try.  A solid 4 1/2 stars for this one.

"I had never heard of this author nor series before I picked this one up from the Amazon top 100 free list.  I'm really glad I did!  Ron Base does an exemplary job with this stand-alone mystery.  The book is well written with few mistakes.  He gives us believable characters to love or hate and a protagonist who puts others before himself.Set primarily on Sanibel and Captiva Islands on Florida's Gulf coast, his writing puts you in the middle of this tropical paradise.  I was transported back to the Sanibel I remembered from my youth, when you could only get to the islands by car ferry and the beaches were long, white and uncrowded...a time long past.I enthusiastically recommend this one to all lovers of good writing, great settings, memorable characters and mystery.  You won't be disappointed, I assure you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZCMVDNB417F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073YCHKW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZCMVDNB417F","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, I am giving this one 3 1/2 stars because I liked it...but I didn't love it.  It just wasn't as funny as it was supposed to be (IMHO).  To me, I find it telling when the best, most memorable part of a supposedly ""laugh out loud funny"" book turns out to be the two beautifully poignant remembrances of the author's friends and neighbors, Donna and Harold.  I suppose I might  end up in the minority where my thoughts on this book are concerned, but I simply feel that it's too cliched and predictable to actually be the laugh riot it wishes it were.The book is fairly well written but has some editing and formatting issues which need to be addressed.If you have some time to kill, give it a whirl...and keep a few kleenex around for the Donna and Harold entries, they'll come in handy.  If the book were comprised of just those two entries...I'd give it 10 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VQ0P6SU0SJQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BY7OH70#wasThisHelpful","R1VQ0P6SU0SJQO","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What kind of courage does it take to stand side by side, under heavy enemy fire, watching your fellow Marines die by the thousands while you film the action essentially unarmed?  This book gives you an idea of the bravery displayed by Marine combat photographers and is as relevant now as it was then.  This book is very interesting and provides incredible insight into the life of a photographer under battle conditions, but...it doesn't offer the number of photos you might expect from a Marine who was legendary and shot thousands of feet of film.  While the written word is incredible there is an old addage, ""a picture is worth a thousand words"".  Unfortunately, this book seems to forget that saying.I give this effort 3 3/4 stars and recommend it to those who enjoy reading first hand accounts of combat and its appalling cost.To the unbelievably brave military personnel who fought and died, those who survived and the photographers who captured the carnage on film, I give my utmost thanks.  The sacrifices you made for your country were, in many cases, above and beyond the call of duty.  Without your dedication to the task, the blood shed for these difficult steps forward might have been for naught.God bless each and every one of you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DC6T4CA5AQEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AVZSQ6E#wasThisHelpful","R1DC6T4CA5AQEE","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy reading quasi-historical novels which involve Colorado and its mining history.  This story didn't disappoint, although the font used (Courier) was a bit of a distraction.  The author did a good job of character building and presented characters the reader could easily identify with.  The setting for the story seemed right in keeping with the reality of the havoc caused by harsh weather conditions on abandoned buildings.  I felt I was actually in the town, and the mine, along with the protagonists.  This is an HEA story and when all is said and done, you as a reader, come away satisfied.

"Right off the bat, let me say that I like the books I've read by this author.  She has a great sense of humor which makes reading her stories a lot of fun.  This book, however, is a departure from the norm in both its subject matter and the way she deals with it.  I'm not saying that there is no humor in this one, because there is...it's just much less apparent than you find in her less serious endeavors.  I think my only real criticism of this effort is that the story seemed somewhat longer than it needed to be.  It could have been improved (in my opinion) if it were trimmed by 10-15%.No, it's not the rollicking joy ride you may be expecting from this author, but I think she did an admirable job on this one, so I gave it a solid four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3DGAD8QXJ8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060PEOR4#wasThisHelpful","R2F3DGAD8QXJ8P","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nearly 70 years ago our 8th Air Force flew into Nazi occupied Holland on a mission which was labeled a ""milk run"".  Passengers literally lined up to fill openings on bombers so that they could observe the planes in action or earn an Air Medal for their fifth combat flight.  The quick in and out attack on airfields and repair facilities should have been routine but things went awry early and never recovered, causing more losses than expected.  This book gives insight and perspective from the American and German military sides as well as civilian views.  The book is well written and allows the reader to experience air combat WWII style.I want to extend my thanks to all the heroes in our Armed Forces who took part in the great struggle which was WWII.  Without the selfless sacrifices of everyone who participated, both military and civilian, the Allies might not have beaten back the Nazi and Imperialist Japanese threat, thus plunging our world into chaos and destroying the freedom we hold so dear.I give this book a solid 4 1/2 star rating and suggest it to anyone interested in a day in the life of our WWII heroes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLU93E26TAFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYMZEL2#wasThisHelpful","R3VLU93E26TAFV","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this cleverly told tale as it was much more than just another sex story.  The author created some memorable and likable characters (as well as a couple you love to hate).  With its food based theme and its accurate descriptions of dishes created by the female protagonist, the reader is confronted with a double challenge...hunger and sexual appetite.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a ""cover that girl in chocolate syrup and #*!@ her til the cows come home"" (thanks, Frank Zappa) type of story.  Food isn't a part of the sexual equation, but caring and loving is.  I felt the author did an outstanding job with her depictions of the sexual part of this love story, nothing kinky or unusual, just two people, one experienced and one not, discovering their love for one another.  It was really quite refreshing.Give this one a try if you have a little time to kill and especially if you are new to this genre.With a bit of dedicated editing I would rate this one five stars but as it stands it gets four.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XLN1X3AAFZLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJTQOL8#wasThisHelpful","R1XLN1X3AAFZLV","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Black and white, right and wrong, honest or dishonest...are these principles nothing more than words, something to be touted as a virtue until they become inconvenient???  Apparently that's all they are for the writer and reviewers of this short story.  With the glowing five star reviews touting the historical accuracy of this one, I thought I'd give it a go...but now that I've finished...I'm ""danged"" disappointed.  It amazes me how people overlook the correct outcome for the convenient one.  This story is simply too filled with contradictions to be enjoyed...unless HEA is the only goal regardless of the path choosen to attain it. The author paints her strong, honest Marshal as a man of principles, one who sees only black and white, no gray areas can sway his beliefs.  Bravo!  A protagonist to look up to, right?  WRONG.  From the opening pages her hero is inconsistent in his actions.  Example: Does an honest gentleman, one who knows right from wrong, secretly watch a woman who is bathing in a river and then use coercion to try and force her to show more?  I think not.  Does that same ""gentleman"" laud his beliefs and then disregard them with barely a second thought?  Not in my world of right and wrong, yet that is exactly what takes place with this character.  What you have here is a bit of yesterday's fiction written with today's lack of conviction.  You know...the end justifies the means.  Well, I say BS!  What kind of woman is so smitten with looks and muscle that she can't recognize the contradictory actions of a man blowing his own horn to impress her?  Yes, I understand there is a sensitive issue which rears its ugly head as a sub-plot but...if the protagonist has beliefs and unshakable convictions, why is he not branded with the courage to stand up for them when he is tested?Here's the bottom line on this one...if you willingly compromise your character's supposed integrity for romance and his total belief system is discarded simply because it's convenient...why even paint him as a man with values and principles to begin with?  Well ""Hell and damnation"" that's the dangedest bunch of hypocrisy I've run across lately.Two stars for this ""today's values"" (or lack thereof) little western.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MRPSU3VSR8DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D0TB0DO#wasThisHelpful","R2MRPSU3VSR8DA","AE41TLMIZPAE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE41TLMIZPAE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story flowed well and was more believable than some of the others in this series.  There were some errors and omissions but they were, thankfully, few and far between.

I also got that when I opened Wordpad to save a copy of this review as I was working on it. It seems that this laptop is typically pushed pretty hard.

You can do basic Office stuff with it. That's about it. As others have noted, it is perfect for a student who just needs to do homework. It is light, so it will fit well in a bag. If you deal with the processor drain you should get decent battery life so that you only have to charge it when you get home. The sub $200 price is certainly right.

Nevertheless, they do a good job of producing sound.They also do a good job of canceling noise by virtue of being over the ear. They don't do any active noise cancellation, but they fit will enough that they mask most of the noise around you.

She is very good at following directions and has good spatial skills. She is also pretty good with her hands.After she spent about 30 minutes with this kit I came downstairs to find the Spirit of St. Louis mostly assembled, the Wright Flyer about 75% assembled, the Space Shuttle assembled well, and the F-18 in pieces because she was so angry she tore it up. I didn't give her much guidance because I wanted to see how it went with the proposed age range. Not so good.The directions are a little confusing because the images don't match the parts very well. The tail section on the Spirit of St. Louis is shaped differently from what you see in the diagram, for example. She really struggled with that, but was able to get past it. The bigger problem was that she just couldn't get everything to stay together.These are fine models, but I wouldn't expect someone 7-15 to be able to assemble them without help. Also, this package is only educational if someone says, ""This was fun, let's look up information about the Spirit of St. Louis.""

"Did you ever wonder how the church managed to survive all those years without lasers and smoke machines? If you look around most American suburbs you can find churches that think it is impossible to survive without incredible sound systems, hip, relevant pastors, and programs for the youth that get them amped up. After all, we need to get people in the door with the bait of relevance and fun before we hook them with the gospel, right?This book is a good antidote to all that springs from that mentality. We don't need to make everything incredibly cool. We don't need to keep generating mountaintop experiences. What we need is what sustained men like Luther and Calvin - the ordinary means of grace. This is true for our churches, our families, and ourselves.How does this play out? It's great if you feel led to go on a mission trip to Chile, but what have you done to minister to your neighbor that just had a death in the family? I don't just mean your ""neighbor"" as the person who is starving in a village in India, but the person who lives two doors down and annoys you because he doesn't keep up his yard or house very nicely. What are you doing to inculcate the faith to your kids? Obviously they need to develop their own relationship with Christ, but they need to at least know about Him. And so on.In other words, the Christian life well-lived is not particularly radical. It still involves going to work, paying bills, buying groceries, and taking your daughter to her ballet class. What this book does is relieve us from the guilt that tends to get heaped on us because we don't do what seems extraordinary. But really the ordinary has become extraordinary. Go to church faithfully. Serve your church. Minster and be ministered to. Love your family. Teach them about the faith. Train them up in the way they should go. Love your spouse. Take care of your spiritual and physical health.These are just the regular rhythms of life, but they are the means that God uses to develop His disciples. The big radical things are great, but really we are fundamentally called to a life faithfully lived. I really appreciate Horton's admonition to live that life and find satisfaction in it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H7XBUHIJ0D5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310517370#wasThisHelpful","R1H7XBUHIJ0D5V","A3JL3YQYI7OR5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JL3YQYI7OR5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I tried this seed under fairly extreme conditions. I put it down before we had several days of rain. I didn't add topsoil, I didn't rake it, and I didn't even really try to get it into the ground. I just put it down to see what would happen.Sure enough, in about a week I noticed some seedlings. I have since fertilized and have begun regular watering. But I did make a point of skipping a day after the rains just to see what would happen. It didn't seem to affect it too much. I still have a fair number of sprouts considering how little work I put into it.I am confident that if you did it right you would have very good results. Is it worth the very high price of this seed? That's hard to say. My dad was an agronomist with a focus on turf grass for 40 years and I asked him what he thought about this seed. He said that the coating was more about marketing than anything.

"I got this because I was legitimately curious about birding. My wife has put a feeder in our backyard and she and my kids have enjoyed looking at the birds with the field guide. I thought it would be fun to learn more about this world, so I read this book. I now feel like I have a pretty solid understanding of the hobby.The material in this book is excellent. I now know a lot more about what to look at and listen for. I know about getting a decent set of binoculars. I have a better sense of resources that are available if I want to get into birding. But what makes this book five stars to me is how all this material is presented. I really like the fun font used for the title and chapter headings. The watercolor illustrations are beautiful. The writing is excellent.I don't know if I will dip my toes into the world of birding or not, but I do know that this book is an excellent primer.

"These are a good set of earbuds. I get a decent range of sound out of them and they cancel ambient noise pretty well. There is no active noise cancellation, but they fit well enough that they do block out most of my office mates.The cord is pretty short, which makes sense considering the whole point of these is that they don't tangle. I like the magnetic clip that works well with a button-down shirt. Plus, this helps to take some of the tension off. Otherwise it feels like they are going to slip out of my ears. The magnetic clip and the magnets on the outside of the earbuds also makes storage much neater than for most earbuds. Normally they get tangled up my bag, but these will stay nice and neat.As you would expect, these come with smaller and larger rubber cups for varying-sized ears. This is pretty standard.Overall, I'm happy with these. They are definitely a cut above what you'd get at Five Below.

"I tried this with my Nexus 6. I realize that it is meant for the iPhone 6 Plus, but the Nexus 6 is just a couple of milimeters bigger in each direction. I have used a TuneBelt armband meant for the iPhone 6 Plus and it works fine.This works OK. It is a very slim armband and you put your phone in it through a slit in the back. Everything is neoprene, so it hugs your phone very tightly. I managed to use it with my phone without taking off the slim case. If I put the phone in by itself I found that the tension made the case keep pushing on the volume buttons.This arm band comes with an extension that anyone who works out consistently will probably need. My arms are not particularly big and I found that it was a little tricky to put this armband on. It did fit, but it was tricky to put on.I do like that there is a little slot for a key. I guarantee that when you have this thing on there will be so much tension that the key is not going to go anywhere.Overall, you get what you pay for with this. If you can afford it you should go with a TuneBelt. But if you are really on a tight budget this will work. I imagine that if it is so tight on my Nexus 6 it will be almost as tight on an iPhone 6 Plus.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8EFXH8SRS12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEIKS1A#wasThisHelpful","R2K8EFXH8SRS12","A3JL3YQYI7OR5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JL3YQYI7OR5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had my 8 year-old son help me test this. He's definitely on the upper-boundary for this game, but what I thought was great was how it adapted itself for him. For example, one game asks you to click on 5 numbers in order. For him it started with 116. Another game asked things like, ""Which of these numbers is less than 5?"" These were good questions for a third-grader. But then we created a new profile for a kindergartner and it started with 6 rather than 116.I also liked how there is a fun payoff after each challenge. The game with ordering the numbers finished with Olaf sliding down a hill and collecting ice crystals. The other game I tried ended with the player waving his hand near a bucket of snow that would turn into a snowball used to cover Olaf in snow. These are basically minigames, but they work well with the controller and camera and would be fun for the target age range.This is definitely a good game for little kids.

"This is a great laminator for household use. I've used another one that will process pages much faster, but this one does the job. It will work with either 3 or 5 mil pouches, which is probably all that most people need. It also will only work with material up to 9 inches wide, which again will suit most uses.It is slow, but that is kind of an advantage in a sense. It doesn't leave bubbles. The box had two sheets in it for starting out and both were somewhat folded. They weren't creased, but they had a serious bend in them.

"I tried this out with my Nexus 6. Pairing was a snap. I used this to play some games with a NES emulator and it worked fine. It is certainly responsive enough. I like how firmly the phone holder snaps in. You can get pretty intense with this and I don't think that your phone will go anywhere. I can't be sure though because it was a little too small for my Nexus 6 in a small case. But if you have a reasonably-sized phone this will probably work.Why not five stars then? Given the price I would have hoped for more quality. The buttons feel rather flimsy. It may look like an XBox controller, but it sure doesn't feel like one. If I received one of these with a Razer Serval console I think I would have been disappointed. It seems to me that if you want to compete with Sony and Microsoft then you should at least be able to make a controller that feels as sturdy.Nevertheless, I can see throwing this in my bag if I want to play something on my phone with a controller.

"I was a little concerned when I opened the box because I have a cockapoo and this ball is clearly weighted for a much larger dog. But my concerns were quickly assuaged when I saw how much he loves this thing. He wants to play with it all day. And when he isn't playing with it he lies down with it. The squeaker gets him riled up and he will chase this ball in the yard as long as I'm willing to throw it.You can throw this like a football, but it isn't easy. The weight feels a little strange and of course there are no laces to grab. But if you're willing to endure a palm full of dog slime you can throw it pretty far with a spiral. Really the best thing about the shape is that it gives all kinds of irregular bounces for the dog to chase. Again, my dog loves it.The ridges are also great. My little guy can't get his mouth around the whole ball like a bigger dog could, but that doesn't stop him. He gets a hold of a couple of the ridges and can carry it just fine.Now, unlike one of the other reviewers who posted a photo of a destroyed ball, I do not have a ""real dog"" in his estimation. However, this toy should be plenty durable for most dogs unless they really put their minds to destroying it.One warning - if you have this in the house everyone will know when the dog is playing with it because the squeaker is very loud. What's great is that the squeaker changes tone depending on how the air is flowing through it. I think that this is part of the charm for my dog. But it is loud. When he first got it I had to put the toy away at bedtime lest he squeak it all night. Think of it like a kid with a new video game. That's how addicted he got to this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6G09KBO3MWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUV6SLU#wasThisHelpful","R1G6G09KBO3MWU","A3JL3YQYI7OR5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JL3YQYI7OR5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Five years ago I made the switch from fancy Gillette Mach 3 blades to a traditional safety razor. I use a badger hair brush and a puck of shaving soap. The problem is that I have to shave my face twice to get a nice close shave. I go once with the grain and once against the grain. But when I'm done it is very smooth and I feel clean all day. I do have to be careful or else I get little nicks.I thought I would give this razor a try since it promises to shave as close as a blade. I've tried using it dry and it doesn't work very well. I've tried it in the shower with some soap on my face and it doesn't work very well. My wife also tried it on her legs and had the same experience. It will give you what I call an ""aesthetic shave,"" meaning that it will shave you close enough that you look OK, but it certainly won't pass the test of rubbing a piece of cotton against the grain on your face.I'm writing this not even two hours after using this in the shower and I already feel like I need to shave again. I don't have a very thick beard either. Maybe I'm missing something in technique, but I don't see how this will really buy me anything other than less nicks.

She is pretty mechanical, so I figured that she would be a good person to test this.The crossbow itself is pretty girly as you can see in the pictures. One cool feature is that it has a combination lock on it, so enemy spies (read: little brother) can't use it unless it is set properly. However, that's not really very meaningful because even when it is set properly the crossbow does not fire consistently. The darts bend and jam. Or sometimes it just doesn't work.

"These are a pretty decent set of noise-reducing headphones. I work in an office with a pretty loud HVAC blower over my desk and these took care of that. However, if you listen to quiet music such as classical guitar you will hear a faint hiss as these try to do their noise-canceling magic. Personally, I think that over-the-ear headphones are better, but these are certainly much better to throw into a bag or pocket.The big cylinder with the AAA battery that includes the noise-canceling electronics is pretty bulky. It comes with a clip, so that's nice if you are a man wearing a shirt with a pocket. However, I don't think that it would be very handy otherwise. If I were a woman I certainly would not want this clipped to the front of a blouse. You also don't want to let it dangle because it's so heavy that the earbuds won't fit right.One thing to note - you wnat to have them turned off when you put them in your ear. The microphones for the noise cancellation are on the oustide of each earbud. When you put your fingers on the microphones it doesn't know what to do with all that noise and it emits a pretty high-pitched squeal. It's not so loud as to damage your ear, but it is certainly uncomfortable.Overall, these are pretty good. It's nice that they are compact enough to fit into a bag. But I'd still rather use over-the-ear headphones if possible. You'll get better sound and you won't have as much hanging off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19NSY6ZQPHF35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C19125A#wasThisHelpful","R19NSY6ZQPHF35","A3JL3YQYI7OR5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JL3YQYI7OR5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this for my everyday tool set. I find that when working around the house I typically don't need more than a screwdriver, pliers, needlenose, and a crescent wrench. This will hold those without a problem. I also like that it has fairly heavy grommets for hanging this on a hook. The Velcro closure folds back on itself well so it won't be in the way of what you're doing.I do think that this would be ideal for chisels though.

"I installed this in our bedroom and I really like the control it gives me over the fan. Just last night I got into bed and noticed that the fan was off, probably because someone hit the switch on the wall. I used my phone to turn it back on. Of course, the irony is that it probably would have been faster to get out of bed.Laziness aside, I tested the security features and they work well. The fan turns on and off according to the schedule as does the light. It is nice to have a dimming feature on my light as well. I can see using this the next time we go on vacation to simulate someone being in the house.I took off a star for a couple of reasons. One is that it is very hard to jam the controller into the box in the ceiling. My canopy did not go back together quite right as a result of this. The good news is that you really need to look hard to see the problem. Other than that installation was a breeze if you can follow directions. It doesn't take a master electrician to install this thing.The other reason is that the app is kind of slow. Your phone has to load the app and then it has to reestablish the connection to the bluetooth controller. You need a very large room or a fan in a very inconvenient place for this to be more than a novelty. Otherwise it really is faster just to walk to the switch.My kids have been in the habit of using the light switch to turn on the fan, so I had to put the remote near the door. Frankly, I find this to be helpful as well.Overall, this is a great product. Just be thoughtful about where you put it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZBT5I5ALE2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQOP2JO#wasThisHelpful","R1WZBT5I5ALE2Z","A3JL3YQYI7OR5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JL3YQYI7OR5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as you pick up the box you realize that this is a serious pot. It is extremely heavy, but that's what you expect with cast iron. The good news is that it is coated, so it doesn't stick. We made some risotto in this and the dry bits came out quite easily. Since it is coated you can wash it like a normal pot and you don't have to just scrub it with a wire brush like you might do with a skillet.I got the purple pot to review and I thought that it was a nice shade of purple. It's not too bright and it almost comes off as a dark blue.But really the color is secondary to how it cooks. Given that the whole point of cookware is to conduct heat to your food I don't understand why you would spend extra on other brands. The coating seems good. The pot works well.

"My kids have gone through a lot of water bottles over the years. We've tried flip straws, unscrew tops, and tops that pull out to squirt the water in your mouth. I think that this is Contigo Jackie Kids bottle has the best design. You unscrew it to fill it with ice and water, but the top flips open with the push of a button for drinking. This means that kids can actually get a lot of water out of it. It also means that if the kid clicks the lid shut you know that the bottle is sealed. Plus, the kids have fun flipping the lid open.Another benefit is that you can actually get the thing clean. The problem with the others is that I always feel like bacteria can grow in the spaces that you just can't get soap into.

"As a baseline for comparison, I've been using a Galaxy S4 for almost 2 years. I have been very happy with my phone over this time and was eager to compare this phone with my experience. I realize that this is not meant to compete directly with a flagship phone, but I figured that since mine was already 2 years old they shouldn't be far off.As far as performance goes I can't tell a huge difference. I threw some very CPU-intensive racing games at the BLU Vivo and they ran just fine. I figured that if there was going to be a problem anywhere that would be where I would see it. I didn't see a problem.As others have noted, the specs on this phone and not impressive by modern phone standards. If you want the latest and greatest you need to go elsewhere. But if you or someone you know wants to get a smartphone without a long-term carrier commitment then this is a great choice.My only concern with this is the interface. One of the great strengths of Android can also be a weakness in that it is easily customized. Each manufacturer takes the base Android code and then customizes it how they see fit (i.e. HTC Sense, Samsung TouchWiz, etc). I am a big fan of trying different launchers, so I quickly installed a different launcher on this phone so I could make it the way I wanted it. That is fine, but it doesn't help when you swipe down for the notifications and you get what I consider to be a somewhat limited interface. I couldn't figure out how to get to a Task Manager, but I did find that tapping the little rocket would ""boost"" the phone. I presume that this kills running apps.I suppose that I could do more research on how to make this better, but to me the whole point of a mobile OS is that you shouldn't have to do that. Nevertheless, I suspect that tapping the rocket will be sufficient for most users. Everything that most people would want to use is in fairly easy reach with a couple of swipes and taps.This is why I still give this phone 5 stars. When I drive my Mazda2 I don't expect it to drive like a Porsche 911 Turbo. When I use a BLU Vivo Air smartphone I don't expect it to work like a Galaxy Note 4 or an iPhone 6. This phone is very good at what it is meant to be. And as others have noted it is extremely slim and light. In fact, it is so light that it almost feels flimsy. I don't think that it is though. I think that it is a well-engineered machine that would make an excellent smartphone for anyone who doesn't want a long-term carrier commitment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UFL3U37JQKT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5C3BCY#wasThisHelpful","R2UFL3U37JQKT1","A3JL3YQYI7OR5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JL3YQYI7OR5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So I wanted to see it this model was in any way better.Unfortunately, it isn't. The snap-on clips look a little bit different, but are as flimsy as in previous version. The thing is, they easily break off. If you misalign the box and the lid just a little bit, you can break the clip. This is what happened to us. The clips snapped off quite often, but then one day just broke off under a tiny pressure.I wouldn't recommend this snack box.

"This is my second Samsung vacuum, so I have something similar to compare this Lift and Clean Bagless Vacuum Cleaner to.The vacuum is very lightweight â excellent for moving up and down stairs. It can be assembled in a minute â just attach the hose and you are done. I like the clear canister so that you can see how much dirt is in it. This canister is easy to empty (âlift and cleanâ indeed). Although many have complained that this vacuum is loud, I dare say, it is MUCH quieter than my old Samsung. It comes with a couple of useful attachments â a mini brush and a furniture brush. A see-through hose is an awesome little addition - you can actually spot where (and if) it is clogged.Now, some things to keep in my:1) I feel that the brush is too narrow. It takes much longer to vacuum the same space in comparison to my older canister Samsung.2) The dirt detector is pretty much a gimmick. I have no idea what is the use for it, unless you are vacuuming in the dark?3) Not much choice in terms of adjusting the power of suction. Same power for every surface.All in all though, I was satisfied with the main quality of this vacuum â good suction. For a vacuum this light it has decent power.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3APZ9795ETR17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8IUDT6#wasThisHelpful","R3APZ9795ETR17","A2W2E6BPPYZO0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W2E6BPPYZO0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start by saying that I am reviewing this touchscreen laptop from a position of a user who utilizes her home laptop mainly for entertainment - watching, streaming, internet surfing, itunes syncing, downloading audio and ebooks, skyping. I do not use it for anything laborious.This laptop/tablet is an odd hybrid. I donât necessarily like everything about it, but I am mostly satisfied with it.Now onto some pros and cons:Pros:1) I love the versatility of it â you can use it as a tablet, as just a screen, as a laptop, as a desktop. You can use a touchscreen keyboard, or attach a regular keyboard, or use this regular keyboard via blue tooth connection.2) The quality of picture is excellent.3) It is sleek looking and light weight.4) It has a fairly long battery life (about 6 hours).5) The laptop comes with a carrying case made of thin lather-like material, itâs more of a cover really. But stylus isnât included.Cons:1) This laptop is very fragile looking, much more so than a tablet like iPad or a Kindle. Especially with a keyboard, it looks easily breakable.2) I do miss a CD/DVD player and HDMI connection laptops usually have. If these two were a part of this laptop, I would have given it 5 stars.Basically, what you get is a tablet with many laptop capabilities. For light use, itâs pretty good if you ask me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QZC3KQYST7AQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCX7Q7C#wasThisHelpful","R3QZC3KQYST7AQ","A2W2E6BPPYZO0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W2E6BPPYZO0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ended up being pleased with the final result, but I think I prefer a regular a/c vent mount over this magnetic one.While the magnets work great and overall it is much easier and faster to place a phone onto a magnetic disc, there is a couple of drawbacks to consider:1) The suction mount will not suction everywhere on your dashboard. I had to make several attempts before I was able to find a spot where it would stick firmly, and this place was rather far from my reach. The sticky disc didn't to the dashboard either.

"I wish I owned this book when I was a child and I wish my parents did all these activities with me! But ok, my boy is growing up, so I will explore all these things myself.This book is an excellent source of fun activities for children of variety of ages and interests. Of course, not all of them will be suitable for every kid. Not everyone would want to weave a mat or make a gum-wrapper bracelet or interpret dreams. Some I wouldn't care for myself - like ""do a skateboard trick."" But most of these activities are super fun - ""go stargazing,"" ""make a papier-mâchÃ© bowl,"" ""make a snow globe,"" and many, many, more. Each activity has almost always only one page of directions and safety tips, but I believe if an activity is interesting, it will be even more fun to learn more about it.

The pockets are of useful shape to keep your bottles, wipes, etc. in place.I agree with others though, the middle pocket suggested for placing a phone to watch something on isn't that great of an idea.

"I have very fine hair and my experience with this oil elixir has been mixed so far.On the one hand, it does nourish and softens my dry hair ends and makes my hair less staticy overall.But on the other, even though I only apply a tiny drop, once I brush my hair, the elixir gets spread all over my hair and makes it look much flatter and a tad oily.I haven't yet decided if I should pick healthier looking ends over a bit sleeker and oily-looking roots.Decisions, decisions...","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LYJR5S5N438P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP255DG#wasThisHelpful","R2LYJR5S5N438P","A2W2E6BPPYZO0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W2E6BPPYZO0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a runner, but I do need comfortable shoes to chase after my toddler and kick a ball with him.These New Balance shoes are great for these things as far as I am concerned.

"First, a disclaimer.  I am neither an engineer nor an audiophile.  I canât always describe how or why sound âworksââ¦ but I know when it doesnât.  Anyone who has ever spent hours and hours imprisoned in the back end of an airplane crossing the Pacific,  limited to what airlines call âstereo headsetsâ , knows what bad headphones sound like. [Maybe theyâre better up at the front of the plane, with the expense accounts and the wealthyâeverything else is.  Iâll never know.]These work, Iâm happy to say.  The sound coming from the QY8s at both ends, bass and treble, is as good as any Iâve heard from wireless earphones in this price rangeâitâs CD quality.  Their ability to cut back on ambient noise is equally impressive.The company tells us a bunch of stuff thatâs probably important, such as listing the five âBluetooth profilesâ.  As I said, Iâm not an audio engineer, so I donât understand what most of it means, except for the last oneâAPT-X.  As I understand it, APT-X is the means by which necessary bandwidth is reduced, enabling earphones to significantly improve their sound. This is something that has only recently been available in earphones in this price range, and is why the QY7 earphones are being replaced by these newer models.Unchanged but useful to know is that they still can be used up to 30 feet away from your smartphone or other device under the mythical optimal conditionsâcall it 20-25 feet in real life if there arenât any walls in the way, and that these are good for up to about seven hours play time. I havenât timed how long these will last on their 80mAh internal battery, but theyâre easily recharged in less than a couple of hours.  I equally havenât experimented with how long they take to lose their charge if they arenât being usedâthe company says a bit more than a week.I also appreciate their appearance; rather than the bright green that some companies are selling, these come in basic black, with a 23 inch (60 cm.) cable running between the two ergonomically designed earpieces (the cable is flat, making it harder to tangle).  The earpieces are matte black with a silver circle; within the circle are the letters âQCYâ, which match neither the brand name (SmartOmni) nor the model (QY8).  I did some cross-checking, and other companies are also marketing QY8s, and theirs are also labeled âQYCâ.Overall, I find these new QY8s easy to wear, with good sound and at a good price pointâand since my QY7s are psychedelic green, theyâre headed for the back of the drawer while these areâ¦Recommended.[SmartOmni offered me these earphones gratis, for evaluation and review.  My reviews, positive and negative, reflect my personal opinion of the product in relation to others priced similarly.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOJZMKTQ9XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140HUHZG#wasThisHelpful","R1EOJZMKTQ9XH","AVY4D87ER3UUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVY4D87ER3UUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second Kiven bulb I have had the opportunity to review, and I like this one at least 50% more than the previous one.  The first one, similarly designed, was a two watt LED bulb, while this one is three watts.  The difference lies in its boasting an extra tier of tiny LEDs.As with the other, when turned on it appears as though the Kiven company has somehow managed to capture and freeze fireworks inside a light bulb.  Tiny LEDs give the appearance of lights bursting three-dimensionally outwards from a central point, an effect improved upon by their golden color.  The retro shape of the bulb serves to make it more interesting, although Thomas Edison certainly never envisioned anything like this.Admittedly, the bulb provides more art than light; it will take a couple of these bulbs to compete with a single 40 watt incandescent bulbâdespite the fact that each of these bulbs contains more than 40 tiny LEDs.  However, for a multiple-bulb chandelier or sconce, these bulbs could provide beautiful and atmospheric light for a room.These bulbs are more oblong than round, coming to a distinct nipple at the top (the original bulbs were hand-blown glass; the nipple is where the pipe would be broken off).  They are slightly more than 2.5 inches wide and 5.43"" high (or 6.4cm x 13.8cm, for Canadians and Europeans), and fit in standard sockets.Recommended.

"The issue mentioned by some other reviewers-- that they didn't recognize that they had to contact the seller if they wanted the address on the label to be different from the one used by Amazon-- was a problem for me, but only a minor one.  The blame seems to be shared-- purchasers failed to read directions that weren't sufficiently clear.I have had better-printed labels, as well as much worse ones.  They come, not quite as pictured with different colors, but in plain black on glossy white-- which is fine, given that we are talking about inexpensive address labels and not works of art.The glue seems adequate for the job, too, although some people have expressed concern.  I chose not to put any of the twelve klogos they offered on my labels-- I didn't care for any of the choices. [Curiously, they do have any American flag-- or at least the illustration on their page shows one, at ""123 American Flag Way"" in Washington DC-- but it's not listed amongst the choices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PW6J0HTVWSFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K89GI9K#wasThisHelpful","R1PW6J0HTVWSFI","AVY4D87ER3UUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVY4D87ER3UUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The vinyl âChalkboard Labelsâ from Home&Us (Ead Industries) are a useful and simple enough ideaâvinyl stickers that may be written on with a special pen, then erased and rewrittenâbut the stickers been designed to look (very loosely) like schoolroom blackboards, and in order to look like chalk on the board, the pen writes in white ink.[Two points, the first of them off topic:  First, so far as I can tell, the only difference between a chalkboard and a blackboard is geographyâat least in the US, in some regions theyâre the one and in others the other.  I have heard chalkboard in place on the West Coast and blackboard in the Midwestâeven when the blackboard was actually green.  For the record, these stickers are all black. Second, whether called a chalkboard or a blackboard, so far as I know the versions used in schools are universally rectangular (and in elementary schools, have the alphabet running around the room above them).  Of these, one in eight isâthe others come in a variety of ovals and gracefully curved shapes, all wider than they are tall.  You have to provide your own alphabet.]The ink is easily wiped away from the sticker with a damp paper towel or cloth, and then once dry the âchalkboardâ can be written on again. So too, the stickers may be peeled off whatever jar or canister theyâve been attached to and stuck onto a different one.  Thatâs an attribute I appreciate, since I have been known to mislabel things. Curiously, the company describes them as dishwasher safe, despite the fact that a damp cloth will wipe them clean.  I havenât experimented with that as yet, having not needed to wash any of my newly-labeled canisters.  [Note: I donât know how well the ink will erase after weeks and months, nor how well the stickers can be peeled away or replacedâI had them for only a short time.  I can only vouch for their functioning at the one-week point.  If I have a reason to change a label some months from now, I may update this review.]The pen, which looks like a large wedge-tipped marker, works differentlyâmore like a can of spray paint.  Before use you have to shake the pen back and forth, listening to the rattle of the tiny metal ball inside, apparently mixing the ink.  Once itâs shaken, press the point of the pen gently against some scrap paper until the ink begins to flow, and youâre good to go.The stickers are loosely 3 inches wide by 2 in. tall (8 cm x 5 cm), and come in a of 48 labels with a single white marker.  I have used them primarily in the kitchen; but plan to extend them to storage containers in the basement and to our earthquake supplies, because they are so easily legible.As an attractive addition, although perhaps detracting from the school chalkboard theme, Home&Us offers a ten-pack of brightly colored âchalk markersâ, which come with reversible tips to give the used the choice between a fine and a bold line.  While this seems to me to be moving the chalk motif from the blackboard to the sidewalk, I can understand the attraction of bright colors.Recommended.[Note: I received these gratis for the purpose of evaluation and preparing an unbiased review.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54S9NPF0TJWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010HN0FN6#wasThisHelpful","R54S9NPF0TJWU","AVY4D87ER3UUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVY4D87ER3UUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These BYB Headlamps, which are shipped two per plain brown box, each utilize a half-dozen LEDs (four white, two red) to provide three separate light settings.  The first two clicks of the single switch turn the lamp on two its dimmer setting, utilizing two white LEDs; âbrightâ is achieved with a second click and two more white LEDs.  A third click of the switch turns off the white lights and on the reds, which are on a flasher.  A fourth click of the switch turns it off.The headlamp is attached to a single, relatively narrow elastic headband in black and gray, with âLED HEADLIGHTâ woven into the elastic.  The strap is fully adjustable.  The elastic is very stretchy.Just to confuse matters, BYB also sells a higher grade model, a CREE LED and more features, including a wider head strap.  The reviews for that headlamp have been mixed into those on this Amazon page, so that it's sometimes hard to tell which review is for which headlamp unless there are photographs.Pros:The âbrightâ level, achieved with two clicks, is quite brightânot CREE level, but bright enough for most uses.  On âdimâ you can still read, especially if you have young eyes (I donât, but I donât have to hide under the covers anymore, either).The battery compartment is easily pried open with a coin or screwdriver, and the part that rests against your forehead is nicely padded.The front piece containing the LEDs tilts away from the battery compartment at up to 90 degrees, ensuring that your light gets where you want it to: your project, book or flat tire.Cons:The light housing feels flimsy, and the elastic strap is quite narrow and relatively weak, and feels as though it might quickly stretch out of shape.  I wouldnât want these to be my only lights on a camping trip, as Iâd be constantly worried theyâd break.The red light mode only flashes.  In the real world, the only use for red LEDs on a headlamp is to preserve your night vision (itâs why Navy surface combat ships use only red lights on the bridge at night).  Flashing red lights canât be used for that, and itâs hard to imagine a situation where you would want flashing red lights attached to your forehead.  Emergency flashers have to be pointed consistently at the source of dangerâ if your car breaks down you want to have your emergency flashers pointed at the road, so no one runs into you.  On your forehead, they flash in whatever direction you happen to be looking.  If these lights were steady, theyâd be good for night vision; flashing, theyâre pretty much good for nothing.Unlike many headlamps sold on the Amazon site, the three AAA batteries that each lamp requires are not provided by BYB.Overall:Part of how I rate products on Amazon is by comparing them to others at similar price points.  In this case, there are better headlamps for sale on Amazon, including some that are significantly better.  They are also more expensive, and some are significantly more expensive.  Comparing these to those would clearly be apples and oranges.On the other hand, there are a few headlamps that appear from their photos and descriptions to be identical to these, only without the âBYBâ on the front, and that are a whole lot less expensive.  At $8.00 apiece, these are pretty cheap, but there are people selling them for even less.Compared to the expensive models, these barely rate two starsâthereâs a reason theyâre shipped in a plain brown wrapper.  But then, compared to a high end Mercedes, my four year old Golf looks pretty cheap, too. I canât give them five stars with the red lights that flash uselessly instead of helping night vision.  I would have given them four, except that the same lights are being sold for much less money, and just a click away on Amazon.  Thus, the 3 Star rating.[Note: I received these headlamps gratis in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review.]","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZYYHLNTME1O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ERPFQW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZYYHLNTME1O7","AVY4D87ER3UUJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVY4D87ER3UUJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The KarnotechÂ® Mini Monopod is, like so many of its type, really misnamedâit isnât a true monopod (a one-legged tripod) so much as, well, a selfie stick.  The part of me that seeks and hopes for linguistic purity was bothered by the misnomer.  Not bad, considering that I have no other complaints at all about this product at all.This remarkably shortâyet quite adequately longâselfie stick is a bit of a construction marvel.  From a sturdy 27.5 inches long, the KarnotechÂ® Mini can be telescoped and folded down to a mere 5.2 inches and slipped into a pocket or purse, and the device only weighs in at three and a third ounces.The âfoldingâ part is the expandable clamp that holds the smartphoneâ the clamp expands between 1.96 and 3.34 inches, and thus can be used with most smartphones.  When not in use it folds down flat against the stick; in use it has a range of 270 degrees, so in addition to selfies it can be used for other sorts of hard-to-get pictures by being held over the userâs head.  In what may be an innovation (that is, something that is new to me, at least), there is also an oval mirror made of chrome attached near the clamp, which can be used for aiming rear camera shots.A feature that I like is that the KarnotechÂ® Mini is âwiredââthereâs a short cable that runs from the head of the stick and is meant to be plugged into the smartphoneâs headphone jack-- it worked well with my iOS phone, but I don't know if it's good on Android or not.  The cable runs down the inside of the stick to a small button in the handle, and all you have to do is push the button to take your picture.Now, I have to admit that I am not much of a selfie-stick userâin fact, as much as I like this one, Iâll probably give it to a friend with children for family pictures.  Itâs not the stickâs faultâI am just not particularly interested in photos of, well, me.For anyone who is, though (no, not who is interested in photos of meâin selfies!), whether for a Facebook page or recording a vacation, or who wants to take group photos with friends or family, this KarnotechÂ® Mini selfie stick makes a lot of sense.  Itâs not limited to selfies, either (which is why my friend may end up disappointed); for taking photos over the heads of a crowd, at a concert, or  a sporting or political event, this selfie stick could be perfect.  In addition, as more venues restrict the use of selfie sticks, itâs good to have one that can be shrunk down to the size of a really fat fountain pen when the guard glowers at you.  Finally, it also makes a fine stand when not expanded, for reading or watching videos.Recommended.[KarnotechÂ®  offered me this selfie stick gratis, for evaluation and review.

Instead, it was shaped like a jar or a large pill bottle.  It made no difference at all, course: the youth were hungry, and the jar held stew as well as a bowl would have.

"Works fine - WHEN YOU READ YOUR MANUAL and understand what you are doing. I learned this the hard way with my new X-5.  Got the unit out, aimed at the camera and....nothing.  Yes, I pulled out the battery plastic thing.  Finally READ the manual for my new camera and found that you have to set it to receive IR signals in the place where you set the self-timer, etc. Then it was fine. (This setting probably saves power by turning off the IR receiver when not needed.)My sensor is on the FRONT of the camera, so standing behind the camera won't work.  You might get by with a little mirror if properly placed.If you want a remote that works from a greater distance, stop complaining about this unit and PAY MORE for a better unit.Remember folks, digital cameras (and accessories) are NOT MAGIC.

"For about $10 more, you can get a reasonable pump maker, and here is why you should:Steam powered units make an entirely different beverage that those that pump heated water through under a certain pressure that is constant. With a pump, fewer undesirables, such as waxy acids are extracted.  What you get with a ""steam toy"" is much more like what you get with a mocha pot.If you are going to make lattes, it may not matter as much, as the milk hides or neutralizes the yuccky acidity.  But for real flavorful espresso, get a modest pump machine.If you already have a steam unit, you can get a slight improvement by shutting it off about halfway into the shot (you have to experiement). This prevents the final superheated burst of steam from releasing even more waxy acids.  It also works with mocha pots.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FMLT31B51WKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000U6BSI2#wasThisHelpful","R3FMLT31B51WKV","A24EMGY9DC4Z72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24EMGY9DC4Z72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am the author of the book, ""How To Use The Digital Camera You Just Bought."" I like to keep up the changing camera scene as I am a frequent guest on Wisconsin Public Radio and elsewhere. It was time to look into ""mirrorless"" cameras and bridge cameras for future reporting. While I teach and write professionally, I am not a pro photographer, so I have more in common with most users, which helps my writing remain relevant. I hope this review will be the same.My purchase was a ""refurb"" sold by another Amazon company for $165.A ""bridge"" camera works similar to a DSLR, but the zoom lens is not removable and there is no mirror-box and optical eyepiece.  Better bridge cameras like this one also have an electronic viewfinder which works great outdoors.  Cheaper models only have the rear screen, which I do not recommend buying.This camera has an optical range roughly from quite wide (24mm in film terms) to about 500mm.  Other brands go out to about 1200mm, but reviews in the UK (often quite critical!) indicate that the range on this brand camera is sharper.  There is also anti-shake technology that helps steady the long shots.Unlike many other cameras, this model has fewer ""modes"" so fans of aperture priority and shutter priority will want to look elsewhere. However, there is the typical ""decision free"" setting, the ""P"" (program setting) that works like decision free but offers more overrides and LIMITED metered manual control.Manual offers only two f/stops, which may also be why there is neither shutter or aperture priority options.  If you want full manual control, look elsewhere.There are quite a few ""scenes"" that pre-set the camera for specific situations and also built-in special effects.One of the best features is the exposure compensation button on the body that allows you to quickly lighten or darken the shot without resorting to a screen menu. Exposure compensation is useful for backlit situations and to slightly darken fall leaves and flowers for more color saturation. In my book, I say this is one of the best controls (and most overlooked!) found on modern cameras!The top shutter speed is 1/1500th, good for most uses, but is nowhere near as high as the 1/4000th found on DSLRS.  The slow speeds also do not reach down to the very slow speeds (1 minute,etc.) found elsewhere.The electronic eyepiece is adequate for framing a shot, but not as high resolution as more expensive models. However it is much better for use outdoors than the big screen. There is also adjustment for your eyesight.The macro mode gets insanely close, down to 1 centimeter. AF is not as responsive as more expensive DSLRs , but for all but extreme action shots, it should be fine. Like so many others in this range, this is NOT the camera to buy for indoor ""gym"" sports shots. Low-light action is a frustration for many who know little about cameras and post one-star reviews that the shots are ""blurry.""  Get the right tool for the job!One con:  The battery door for the 4 AA batteries is tight and needs to be handled with care.  The SD card is in the same area, so it will be opened often unless you use the connection USB cable. Don't get frustrated and try to force it!I'll post more as I get through the 224 page manual.  There is a lot to like in this camera, especially as the price drops due to new models.I'm not a big video user, so I will leave that for later.For the price I paid, I'm happy so far.  Will I ditch my aging DSLRs and lenses?  Perhaps.Get ready to see fewer ""old school"" DSLRs with mechanical mirror boxes and optical finders.  The pro cameras of the future may have more in common with this camera than you think!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BOSM0SL6IZJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091T97J6#wasThisHelpful","R2BOSM0SL6IZJT","A24EMGY9DC4Z72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24EMGY9DC4Z72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE: Seller was wonderful!  They send a replacement even before I shipped the first one back.  I'm up to three stars and will be able to evaluate it more soon.  But what a great seller!Replacement works fine and is the best ""novelty"" camera I have used.  Beats the black 2 MP ""world's smallest"" models.You will have read the instructions CAREFULLY.  It is also a good idea to plug the camera in to the PC with it TURNED OFF.  Otherwise you may trigger the ""new found device wizard"" which gets you nowhere. It's also easy to go into sepia mode without knowing it.There are instructions for setting the date and time, but I am trying to find a way for it NOT to show the time.For the TOY/LOMO fan, this is a good buy.

"Having taught eBay classes for about 10 years and even writing an electronic book on the subject, I am addicted to cruising thrift stores. That's where I found a virtually unused unit with accessories for $6.50.Had somebody donated a dead unit to get a tax credit or with the mistaken idea that ""maybe somebody can fix it."" [You can't].With dual lights flashing and no apparent water leaving the generous water tank, I thought it was clogged or the pump was no good.  But then I remembered to PRIME THE PUMP. I did this by switching over to the steamer and letting it chug until some water came out. Then I switched back to espresso and pumped out some water.  Presto!  Problem solved.  I wonder if some folks here have forgotten to do that when no water comes out?Cheapos are getting better than a few years ago. This (Chinese) maker is ready to dispense a shot in very, very short order.Like the ""better"" machines, this unit sends a pre-brew squirt of water before the main flow begins. The taste is about the same, and my only complaint is that the ""push the button and then turn the dial"" is a bit odd. Probably a way to keep costs down, less complex.Obviously Mr. Coffee's holding company is not in the business of stocking parts or making repairs, but this is more common everywhere now that these devices are all from China.  It is cheaper to send you another one than paying some tech a large hourly wage to swap out a gasket.The alleged complaints that some have been told the units are out of warranty at the time of purchase because they are ""new old stock"" is intolerable.  What they are really saying is that they have moved on to another model or found another supplier and have no replacements. That is THEIR problem, not yours! People experiencing such a dodge should contact their elected representative so they can contact the FTC.  Trust me, it works!Regarding leaks, I strongly suspect that many never read the instructions or did not keep track of how many drips finally filled the holding area below the metal shelf.  You can't fix stupid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVQFW1U7H051/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EU9UTM#wasThisHelpful","R3AVQFW1U7H051","A24EMGY9DC4Z72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24EMGY9DC4Z72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I write and teach about camera use (my book is on Amazon). This unit was sent to me for evaluation. I am not paid for my reviews.Many years ago a US monthly photo magazine ran a fake full-page ad (probably in the April 1 issue) for a non-existent photographic accessory called a ""Hail Mary Helper.""  Named after the last-minute desperation plays found in some sporting events, this device attached to a photographer's camera and allowed it to be hoisted far above a crowd with the idea that any shot taken would be better than from behind the crowd and, if lucky, it just might catch something great. [The ad was not found humorous by some, others never heard of a HM play, and still others tried to buy it.]Take this fake device, turn it 180 degrees, add a dash of narcissism and a camera phone and you have a selfie stick.However, this particular stick has many genuine uses for all kinds of photographers and will remain useful after the selfie fad is yesterday's news.First, it comes with fittings for camera phones, Go-Pro type cameras and a standard 1/4-20 thread for tripod sockets.  As most cameras now have some kind of wireless remote, this all makes sense.Second, at the bottom of the padded handle is another tripod socket, so the unit could be attached (for example) to a sturdy tripod for an even higher point of view.  [Beware of top-heavy situations!]Third, new, lightweight battery powered LED lights can also be attached to insert light in otherwise inaccessible locations.Fairly inconspicuous when collapsed, the unit extends quickly and has an articulated top and a small parabolic mirror to aid in aiming the camera.There is an included bluetooth remote for cameras so equipped. My little Nabi Square HD camera with 170 degree stills and videos has it's own remote.The build quality is quite good, with the all-important top head tightened with a screw, not a rivet. This means it can be tightened if needed.Will all such sticks, extremely heavy DSLRs are probably not the best choice.  Even if the unit holds up, your arm may not be able to control the excessive weight.  Get the right tool for the job...a smaller camera!NOTE:  Do ask first in public places (especially indoors) about stick use.  It's just a common courtesy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J0S90DEM0JNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJNH0BS#wasThisHelpful","R2J0S90DEM0JNU","A24EMGY9DC4Z72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24EMGY9DC4Z72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am using an older model, not from Germany, not from Mexico or China but (I think) pre-PRC Hong Kong.My two espresso machines work best with a very high quality burr grinder.  I found a used one that sold new for around $600 and I cannot get it set to grind fine enough for espresso.  Perhaps it is worn down, I don't know.So I tried my Krups and got pretty good results!  This is why I was suprised:Most blade grinders end up with an ""aggregate"" of grounds in terms of size.  This usually doesn't bode well for espresso machines, as the pressure finds the largest grains and works it's way through.

"I found one of these unused in the box and made in India. Apparently the latest batch are from China, and once were from the USA.This is basically an all metal mandolin slicer without the other blade options.  The cutting deck can be moved manually (no gears or gimmicks) and the instruction PLAINLY say to keep your finger on the rear tab (to offset any slippage).I just sliced up some potatoes and it worked well and is MUCH, MUCH easier to clean than those ones with lots of plastic parts and slip-in blades.In short it is an old-fashioned design that works as described. No, it isn't Bluetooth enabled.Now, if you are adept at cutting with a decent knife and board, you may not like this.  But for me, it has it's place.Please note: This and all other slicer-dicers have SHARP blades.DO NOT use this if you are prone to distractions, trying to watch TV while slicing, arguing, or have an animated political discussion!  You will cut yourself and have no one else to point your bloody finger at and blame. I know this from long past experience.  Don't ask.Also USE the finger shield and do not let small children or accident-prone people (such as my co-worker who TWICE backed out of the home garage forgetting to open the garage door).

Also claims that the rose tea offers ""Reduced symptoms of depression,calmed nerves"" will not go over well.  At least the ""has not been evaluated"" verbiage should be somewhere.For example, I find Earl Grey tea [not from this company] with both natural and artificial flavor. Then there is the question of preservatives, etc.Even though the company appears 100% respectable, people and the feds will want to know more. A simple laser printed sheet would suffice, as a similar  label on the tin would probably be OK as well.I did appreciate the sugar packet, which clearly implies that a bit of sugar can bring out the taste.

I LMAO at the scene where she's trying to get the fully loaded pack on for the first time and I think she did a marvelous job of portraying a woman who is sure of herself, but yet still afraid of what she's facing - but confident enough to see it through.  Anyone who's ever gone on a backpacking trip of more than a few days will totally relate to this movie, just suspend your disbelief a little for the small details - IT'S A MOVIE!

"They seem to fly pretty straight, so far only 4 of them haven't had the proper aerodynamics to fly straight and land in the middle of the fairway.  They do, however, seem to have an anti-gravity force field that I take issue with because I'm having a hard time getting them to consistently drop into the cup.  I'm hoping that Srixon responds to my requests to develop a Death-Star ball so that I can more easily slay my competition.Seriously though, they seem to be pretty good balls and the price is far more acceptable than ""the ball more tour pros play"".  Come on people, if you're not a ""tour pro"" then will you really notice a quantifiable difference?  I highly doubt it.  The only thing I believe is that I can't trust ""used"" or ""reconditioned"" balls because who knows how long they may have sat in mud, water, etc.  I'm willing to accept the fact that at my level of play I WILL lose balls, and these are at the price point that I'm willing to accept - and they perform to my level of play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N6TAZH0Q79FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1MZ22C#wasThisHelpful","R1N6TAZH0Q79FG","A13WTW1IQFI0GF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WTW1IQFI0GF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very sturdy cart, holds the bag that I normally use on a driving cart and so has relieved me of the need to move my clubs from one bag to the next like I used to do when I was walking instead of riding.  Putting it together is very easy, just make sure you get the wheels on the correct axles.  I didn't read the directions and ended up with the fronts on the rear and vice-versa.  The pouch on back is just big enough to hold my driver head cover, putter cover, and hybrid cover.  I haven't used the cooler, but it does have drainage and so I can imagine it would work quite well.  I've had many compliments on it from other push cart owners, so it must be pretty good.  It folds up pretty compactly, I have a Hyundai Veloster and I stow this behind the passenger seat - short legged passengers have no comfort issues riding when I have the cart back there.  Being a fair weather golfer I have yet to use the umbrella holder, but when I fiddled with it in the garage it seems to be pretty nice.

"When I woke up this morning and, like I've done practically every morning since September 10, 2008, and frothed my milk with the Aerolatte I thought it was high time I updated my review.  To my chagrin I found that I never had reviewed this marvelous piece of kitchen gadgetry.  So as if the fact that I've used this nearly every morning for almost 2,000 days should be review enough.There's really not a lot to review since it has one feature; turn it on and the whisk spins, frothing your milk.  It does this extraordinarily well.  Unlike other reviewers here I don't find myself replacing batteries every two weeks, I would remember that.  But I don't keep meticulous records of my battery replacement activities so I'm no help there.Some reviewers complain that it doesn't froth non-fat, low-fat or ""milk"" made from various tree nuts or legumes very well.  My response is that it isn't the fault of the frother, so DON'T BLAME THE FROTHER!  One of the primary reasons you can get copious amounts of froth from the milk of animals is the amount of fat in it.  When you reduce or remove the fat, you reduce the ability of milk to produce and hold foam.  My morning coffee consists of coffee, 1T MCT oil, 1T organic whipping cream, 1T pastured unsalted butter - If I produced any more foam the cup would probably float away!Bottom line - don't listen to the whiners who complain that they can't get their walnut milk frothy enough.  If you want that kind of froth you're going to have to buy an expensive machine that shoots 212 degree pressurized steam into your product, and even then, without fat, you're going to be disappointed.  For the price of four snooty, burnt up tasting venti's you can make your own froth.As an aside to the lactose intolerant people who can't use heavy cream like I do - you can use the mct oil to add some healthy fat to your tree/legume milk and you should get a better froth out of it if froth it is you seek.I almost forgot - this thing has been great on the trail backpacking.  If you've ever eaten any of the pre-packaged, just add water, dehydrated backpacking meals you know how you sometimes end up with dry clumps.  I don't, because I take this along with me and use it to mix the water into the meal.  Yeah, by the time I come back I may have to take a toothbrush to the whisk to get little bits out of it, but cleanup isn't as laborious as some here might lead you to believe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REX1CVAED2WOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002KZUNK#wasThisHelpful","REX1CVAED2WOS","A13WTW1IQFI0GF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WTW1IQFI0GF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very attractive alternative to the straight from the store plastic soap bottle.  The only downside is that after a while the small opening will start to gum up with drying soap.  To remedy this problem you need to dilute the soap with some water to get it thinner.  As other reviewers have stated, the dispenser tip is extraordinarily fragile.  When I was taking mine out of the box I accidentally dropped the tip, still in it's bubble wrap, on the kitchen floor and it shattered.  This is not a reason for a lower rating, my clumsiness caused that....but subsequent emails to the manufacturer to inquire about purchasing replacement ""spouts"" yielded absolutely no response - so that in my book drops you a star.I bought two more - one just for the spout.  The other one I use in the bathroom to measure out mouthwash - it looks magnificent and performs flawlessly with the watery liquid mouthwash.Overall these are very stylish and functional, as long as the liquids aren't too thick.

"I loved this from the moment it arrived.  Yes, when you take it out of the package it will retain the crease marks from folding.  But if you're like me you will spill your morning coffee on it within a couple of weeks, forcing you to clean it in some way.  If you're also like me you will recoil at the thought of how much the dry cleaner is going to charge you so you'll ignore the cleaning recommendation on the label and wash it at home.  I applied stain remover then put it in the wash on the gentlest cycle available, in cold water.  So far so good.  Then I dried it on ""Air Fluff"" (NO heat) for 40 minutes, then upped the heat to the ""Delicate"" cycle for another 30 minutes.  It came out stain free, and the packaging creases were gone as well.  There was no noticeable shrinkage, and all of the stitching remains straight and true.  So if you are careful and take some extra time you can care for this at home and not have any issues.As for comfort - I like my room to be pretty cool at night for sleeping and this provides just the right amount of heat retention for me.  Mind you I've slept in the Rockies with the windows open and the temperature (in the room) at 17-degrees, so it doesn't take much to keep me warm.  If you are a naturally cold sleeper this will not be enough to keep you warm without additional bed coverings, but it is very nice looking and well made in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IYNVSUR2GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000R2X8JG#wasThisHelpful","R3IYNVSUR2GH","A13WTW1IQFI0GF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WTW1IQFI0GF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Just remember that you have to pre-heat it in order for it to work properly, so don't give it a bad review if you're not willing to prepare the product correctly....I give 1-star to the users complaining about this carafe not keeping things hot when it's their own fault.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ENIANXM6CLRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MAOOLE#wasThisHelpful","R2ENIANXM6CLRV","A13WTW1IQFI0GF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WTW1IQFI0GF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just had my first cup of this, having roasted a batch two days prior.  I roasted it to a full city roast and the flavor is very good.  I'm not conversant in all of the ""spice, floral, etc."" ways to describe a coffee.  All I know is that this far outweighs any store bought, pre-roasted and pre-ground coffee I've had and that's good enough for me.  I won't go so far as to say that it's any better than CBD's already roasted version of this blend because honestly my palate isn't sophisticated enough to be able to discern that.

"I like this over the gel because there is no odor involved, and you don't have to ingest silica like you do with the gel.  Yes the gel is a better value for the money dosage wise, but I'd rather pay a little extra for the benefit of not ingesting an ingredient that my body doesn't need.  My ONLY issue with the purchase of THIS particular product (the capsules), is the pricing.  You can absolutely find this identical product for $15-20 less from other online vendors (and some also provide free shipping).  Don't get me wrong, I am an Amazon devotee and have been for many, many years, but if I can save $20 shopping elsewhere I will.

"Considering the price this is a good value purchase.  Although not as high a quality as the major brick & mortar competitor Mauna Loa, the nuts are of a good size and, to me, are salted just right.  About 20% of the nuts are of a darker color and have a slightly off taste, but not so bad that I'd pitch them.  I'd guess that about 50% of the nuts are halves, the rest whole nuts.  As I say, for the money it's a good buy.  If you are looking for more intact nuts, and more consistency in flavor then you'll have to spend the extra money for the Mauna Loa Macadamias, Dry Roasted with Sea Salt, 11-Ounce Packages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NS8OGW542KLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RVT5B0#wasThisHelpful","R3NS8OGW542KLQ","A13WTW1IQFI0GF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WTW1IQFI0GF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't really say that it's any better or worse than any other bug and tar remover I've ever used.  The bottle seems to leak a lot, which is annoying, so better not store it in the trunk of your car or you'll end up with a stain.  But to be clear, my review is of the product performance, not the packaging.  Bottom line is that unless you're fond of the company and have brand loyalty I would buy whatever tar and bug remover has the best value for the money.

"I recently purchased a new car with one of the large touchscreen integrated systems and so adding a new stereo was out of the question.  I bought this to compensate for the horrible auto-industry standard Bass-Midrange-Highrange ""equalization"".  I had it professionally installed by an AudioControl authorized dealer, in addition to a separate amp and new speakers and I have to say that this little equalizer is PHENOMENAL!  You will NOT be disappointed in how much more rich and full the sound is.  I have permanent hearing degradation in the high and mid ranges from 20-years in the Navy of high noise exposure and this unit has enabled me to put more emphasis in exactly the spots where I have a deficiency.  I can once again fully appreciate so much that I've missed by not having an equalizer in my car with the same capabilities as the one I use in my house.  Very highly recommended.  I also recommend the  2XS - AudioControl 2 Channel Electronic Crossover so that you can split the output from this to a sub-woofer mono amp as well as the amp for your door speakers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8IKFXF3VPPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UDM3HO#wasThisHelpful","R3N8IKFXF3VPPG","A13WTW1IQFI0GF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13WTW1IQFI0GF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thought this greenhouse was going to be tricky to assemble since it has so many parts, but they all fit together easily even with only one page of tiny print instructions, and NO screws or bolts!  Just push each rod into the next building from the bottom up, lay the shelves on top (they aren't long enough to reach the ends of the areas where they sit so don't know if that's intentional, this is my first real greenhouse), then put the plastic cover on and Voila!  It's done in less than an hour with only one person.  I moved my tender plants into it about a week ago but left the door rolled up since it was only down in the high 40s at night, but two nights ago I started zipping up the door to see how air tight it was and if any condensation would form like it should.  It does.

"I gave this grinder a near 5-star rating at first.  Compared to my previous burr grinders it was quieter, a more perfect even grind, and far less messy. It was actually true that the design reduced static. But I did not get even 3 months use out of it before it simply quit.  At first I thought  the outlet was faulty.  Nope. My husband checked the safety switches on the machine (i.e. the lid has to be on tight or it will not grind) hoping to find a fixable reason that the electricity was not getting to the motor.  Very disappointing!  I especially liked the ""timer"" which is just a setting vs. a spring timer.  I could set it on 3, which would cause it to run about 10-11 seconds, which was perfect for what I do every day.  No need to turn or set the timer every time you grind,  and no spring action timer to break.  Unfortunately, I don't think the other Capresso grinders have that feature, but I won't buy this one again.  I know even the best of high end production lines can sometimes produce a lemon, but my experience is apparently echoed by other reviewers.  I'm sad about it,because while it worked it was fantastic.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AWAUCTLEA6RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G8Y2NG#wasThisHelpful","R1AWAUCTLEA6RM","A3NS13VBQS0HS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NS13VBQS0HS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm surprised I like this as much as I do.  I started with Perricone MD foundation and found it not to have enough coverage, so I used it under other foundation products so as to take advantage of its claimed benefits.  I noticed an improvement in the appearance of my skin after a couple of weeks. Can't say for sure it's the Perricone, but on advice of a beauty consultant, I added the concealer to those areas that needed more coverage.  It surprisingly makes enough difference for casual wear to be used without any other added foundation.  I added Dr. Perricone's bronzer to my collection, as well.  Such a tiny amount is needed, which is the opposite of the foundation. My next purchase will be the blush,  Perricone products are so dang expensive, which is the only reason I docked it a star.  It may well be worth it, and therefore unfair to take away a star, but as a trusted cosmetic chemist once told me, ""the cost markup indulged in by the cosmetic industry is second only to the illegal drug industry.""  Maybe true, maybe not.  I know that I cannot really justify paying the outrageous prices I pay for makeup.  I could probably retire on the amount I've spent over the years.  And after all is said and done, I cannot possibly know if it has honestly made any difference over Target-priced products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D39BRCS6VN2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MRQJ18#wasThisHelpful","R2D39BRCS6VN2W","A3NS13VBQS0HS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NS13VBQS0HS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was my first burr grinder, so I have no real comparison except for 2 previous blade grinders I've owned. (See update below).  I was lucky, and immediately found the ideal setting to be 3.25  for my drip coffee maker.  I've had this grinder for about 2 years and it has never failed, but I rarely use a fine setting.  I tap it after each grind to empty the shoot.  Occasionally I clean it with a brush, but not religiously.  I can't believe the difference in flavor using fresh burr-ground coffee.  But I also realize that my new  Capresso single cup brewer and fresh Trader Joe's coffee contributes to the success.  It is oh- so-much better than any K-cup I've ever used.  But the trade-off is indeed the huge mess it makes. Thus 4 stars.  According to other reviews by those who have more experience with burr grinders, this grinder may indeed be messier, but my search for how to reduce static (which is the main problem) revealed it is a typical problem with burr grinders.  The best tips I found for that are 1) waiting a minute after grinding before opening the lid,  2) wetting your finger ever so slightly and stirring the beans with your wet finger before grinding.  It all helps, but it by no means is a mess-free operation.  I will be comparing my grinder to a Capresso 580  in a few days, as I have access to one at work. I'll update after that.Update:  The Capresso burr grinder 580, (only a 3-star product on Amazon) is significantly less messy. I means SIGNIFICANTLY.  I would not recommend the Nesco after having seen this difference.

"I have not enjoyed a book so much in a very long time!  Amazon  offered the ""audio"" version for an extra $9.99 and it was so worth it. I have not used audio books before, but this narration really is outstanding.  I can read along and even though the British pronunciations aren't always the same as what I'm used to, there are plenty of unfamiliar words in this book that the help of hearing them is appreciated.  It is such an elegant narration,  Science was never so much fun!  I'm always excited to share what I've learned from this book with others.  It really is fascinating stuff!  Things you never knew you never knew.  And of course, science and theories are forever changing, so the going theories of 2002 may not be what is accepted as most probable today, but still, there is plenty of background on how we have progressed in our efforts to understand the earth, the ocean depths, microbiology, the universe, and evolutionary processes.  It's a discovery experience  that I don't think anyone should ignore, - creationist or atheist or anything in between.  I'm a believer in God, but I am not so bold as to assume he couldn't have used evolution. How would I know what His process is?  I see God as the Great Scientist who knows all natural law beyond anything we can even grasp.  But what man has learned so far is dang impressive!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q312BZ9GCWKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FBFNII#wasThisHelpful","R3Q312BZ9GCWKJ","A3NS13VBQS0HS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NS13VBQS0HS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really can't say I love this hat, even though I feel it deserves 5 stars based on the accurate description and quality.  I think I expected that the draped part in the back would be more feminine and less tent-like.  It's comfortable though, and doesn't blow off in the wind as long as the strap is securely cinched.  It is really about protection from the sun, of course, and that is where it shines (no pun intended.)  Also, I like the color ""Lapis"" very much.

"I was really surprised that I could hardly zip these up.  I did not read any reviews that described them as narrow in the calf.  I've gotten many boots that ARE described as narrow and have never had a problem, so I wasn't expecting this at all.  I'm wondering if I got an odd pair ?  I got 8 W, and although I didn't intend to get Wide, the foot bed is fine.  Just more room for a foam pad.  They are really nice boots -- great quality, nice burgundy color - not too pink and not too orange, pretty lining.  The leather is waterproof and they can be wiped clean with a damp cloth.  Mine bunch just above the ankles, but this slenderizes the ankles, so I like the look. They don't dig into my ankles  as some people have experienced.  I wore them around the house for 15 minutes and the pinching at my right calf was pretty miserable.  The left calf was tolerable. My right calf is 14 1/2"" and my left is 14 1/4 inches.

"I purchased the Magic Mesh  ""as seen on TV"" version, hung it in easily and it worked beautifully, but it was too short for my oversized slider, so I moved that one to another door, and rehung it, again with no problem, even though it meant reusing the double stick tape.  I was happy to find this Life and Fit Magnetic Screen in a longer version for my slider.  It arrived much faster than predicted, but it does come from China, so be prepared to wait. Getting it to hang so that the magnets would grab was not nearly so easy as with the other one.  Hint:  Cut the two sides apart and hang the middle where the magnets come together so that the edges are just touching and a fraction of an inch higher than the outside edges.  You want to help those magnets move toward each other. My first hang ended up unsatisfactory.  The magnets were sluggish about coming together, and about half the time, I had to reach down and close the last couple of magnets at the bottom.  Taking the double stick tape off the door frame was as bad as you would imagine. After scraping it all off, I got new tape to rehang. But it's better this time.  Not perfect, like the other one, but better.  Getting the double stick off the door frame was about as bad as you can imagine.  And for the longer version, more tape than they supply is needed in my opinion. Of course, I had to buy new tape to re-install.  It came with a lace border which I attached at the top.  It looks nice. I bought the brown color, and I wish I had bought the black.  I have black in the original one and it tends more to disappear behind the glass.  But I have no complaints with how it looks.  Another note:  this one was a couple of inches wider than the tv version, which means it would not fit your average-width door. Measure before buying, noting that the install involves placing the double stick tape on a surface that it can stick to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCCP8YS5PCMBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YM93SKO#wasThisHelpful","RCCP8YS5PCMBX","A3NS13VBQS0HS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NS13VBQS0HS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am finding this product to be superior to  most self-tanners.  I have to say it is not quite as good as the more expensive brand (MyChelle) which is my favorite, but the difference in price is quite significant.  MyChelle has been out of stock for quite some time, so I tried this one.  It's but pretty darn natural looking, even on my feet.  A lightly warmer color than MyChelle produces, but to be honest, it is almost imperceptible.  Most brands make dark spots at the ankles and toes which  advertise that you use self-tanner, but I'm finding this product is not prone to that problem.  I mix a little of my regular moisturizer into it and with a little effort to get it even, I'm having good luck.  Even in bright sunlight, I see very few flaws with my fake tan, and if I do, a little regular moisturizer on those spots seems to fix the problem after a few hours.  It lasts well, also. I use a sugar scrub 2 or 3 times per week to keep skin prepared for a nice fake tan.  I have fair to medium coloring and stay out of the sun, so my self-tanners have their work cut out.  I have not tried using it on my face, but when I do, I'll update.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D3LTAA5UXA5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001SAUBOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1D3LTAA5UXA5T","A3NS13VBQS0HS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NS13VBQS0HS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Don't know how anyone manages without a password app like this.  I have it installed on all my devices.  It works best on my computers.  As a phone app, sometimes I struggle to figure out how to use it to logon automatically.  But at least I can look up my passwords easily enough using this app. On portable devices, it would be unwise to simply leave it ""on"" which would allow anyone who got hold of your device to logon to any site that requires your UID and PW, so that limits it to being a vault only.  At least in my case, because I don't use my phone as a browser except sporadically. For my home computer, I keep it on for the most part. logging on manually has become a thing of the past for all but the most secure sites, such as government sites that require multiple logon steps.  I do have concerns that if it were ever hacked it could be a disaster, but it's a chance I'm willing to take.  They claim it is ultra un-hackable, but how really knows?  In any case, there is no way I could remember all of my passwords and ID's nor am I willing to carry around a list or a separate device to store them that would require manually updating with every change or addition.  This app grabs ID's and PW's when you logon and stores them for you automatically unless you tell it not to on any specific logon.  If you have more than one logon for a given site, it stores all of them and brings up a popup box for you to choose the correct logon.  This makes it easy for my husband and I to share the account.  We pay for the unlimited version and get our money's worth for sure. One thing, to be fair to anyone who uses your computer, you should tell them it will grab their ID's and PW's and that they should delete them from Password Box to retain their privacy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZR6J7BAHRI0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZW8GRA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZR6J7BAHRI0W","A3NS13VBQS0HS8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NS13VBQS0HS8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm disappointed.  I have tried over-applying to get enough color, and it looks great on lips and cheeks for a bit.  But it fades in no time and constant reapplying removes the BB cream foundation I use, so then I look like I forgot to apply my makeup as flaws and discoloration become more apparent.  I got Petunia, which is a bright peachy color. Very pretty and just right for my coloring if it would just stay.

"I bought a product like this for $9.99 that works better. Mine doesn't use a cell phone or GPS, it just uses a transmitter that sits on my desk. It's certainly not as sophisticated. The problem with both mine and this one though is that you have to be able to attach it to whatever you want to keep track of.  It would look stupid dangling from my glasses even if I could think of a way to attach it, and there is no way to attach it to a remote. If you can't attach a keyring to the item, you can't attach this finder thing.  And it's bulkier than the one I use which is bulky enough.  I wish someone would come up with tiny stickers to place on things that could be activated by an electric panel. And $49 for each gadget to find one item, I don't know, maybe it's worth it for luggage.  But what if the battery dies?

"I've already written a review of book 2.  I guess I'm doing this out of order.  I'll just say that this book starts out happy and rather unremarkable, except for the incidences of incorrect English which bugged me a lot at first, but I got thoroughly engaged about 1/3 into the book.

"When I started the first book of the series, I was not very impressed with some of the writing.  For example, I hate when people say, ""older than me"" or ""older than her.""  Quoting charcters who would speak that way is okay, but in the narrations, I would expect correctly English.  But there was enough to love about how the characters and the story developed that I'm giving it 4.5 stars.  I bought all 4 of the series and I'm enjoying #3 right now.  It has brought home the sadness of the reality that there have been and still exit societies that allow and even encourage men to use and abuse their women, and societies where children are beaten routinely as an accepted method of discipline.  I have also been inspired by a hard-working people, and by the strength of a young woman who loves, forgives, and conquers with nothing but her good heart.  I'm also enjoying becoming more acquainted with an unfamiliar culture.  The setting is a small farm community in New Zealand in the 19th century.

"I thought all self-tanners were pretty much the same until I tried this one.  NO orange, no streaks, even on my feet.  The only drawback --  It is pretty expensive for being such a little container, and it has been out of stock since I bought the first one, so I'm bummed that I won't get it in this month's subscribe and save. A tube lasted me about a month.  First time I used it, I applied it full strength to my legs only. The next day I had to think back to my time in the sun, which had only been about a  half hour after 5pm.  I don't tan that easily. The color is so close to a sun-induced tan on my fair to medium skin that I couldn't believe it. Since the first application, I've mixed a little into my favorite lotion each day rather than using it full strength, and it works really well to maintain the rich color.

In another place it stated  17"" which IS what I was looking for. I just measured -- from the top of the heel to the top of the shaft is 16"" in a size 8.  I am 5'' 4"" and they hit me just below the knee, which is perfect. I really like the color - I chose the ""dark tan"" which is a dark cool brown, not golden or reddish brown at all.

"I was beyond excited when this BBQ grill brush came in, as we just got our backyard done, including a brand new BBQ grill! We have used it a few times, and my dad was in desperate need of a brush to ensure that it stays nice and clean, and doesn't have too much build up. This grill brush is very firm, which is great because you can use a lot of pressure when cleaning your grill without worrying about it breaking. The handle is really nice as well. You can get a really firm grip on it and it is comfortable in the hand-- it was comfortable to hold for myself and my father. There is a hook at the end of the handle so you can hang it up-- talk about easy storage! This worked great at cleaning the grill, and it is DEFINITELY heavy duty! This has been a wonderful addition to our household, and it will sure get a lot of use since it is grillin' season!-Received for the purpose of my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9HUOTD3DOYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONGPC14#wasThisHelpful","R3F9HUOTD3DOYG","AD9JPNVX2COPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD9JPNVX2COPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(Keep in mind, I am a size small in Juniors and he is a size medium in mens.. NOT HAPPENING!) This shirt fits him perfectly, and he said it is SO comfortable to wear! The material is really soft, and even after washing it, the print stayed on the photo. He absolutely LOVES it, and now has his own so he doesn't have to have the urge to steal mine!

"I am obsessed with this skirt. When I got it in, I was a little hesitant because I have a very... flat body. This skirt fits me so well! I got a size small and I usually wear a size 0 in jeans and shorts. This skirt fit me really good-- it wasn't too tight or too loose in any areas. Another plus? It makes me look like I have a booty! I kid you not! I thought it would look terrible on me due to my lack of booty, but this makes me look like I have one (it may be little, but it's there!). This is perfect for jobs, church, or just getting dressed fancy. It is really comfortable to wear, and it doesn't ride up while wearing it, which I love!

It comes with everything you may need-- the charger itself and the cord to plug in the charger. As a fair warning to everyone interested in purchasing-- be sure to read what phones it is capable with! A lot of the new phones that have recently come out, or are currently coming out, have the technology to be able to use this. However, older phones are more than likely not compatible. With that being said, I was able to use this to charge my phone and it worked great! It didn't charge quite as fast as the cord I plug my phone into, so I took away one star for speed.

It comes with the micro SD, but also the larger SD so you can insert the micro SD card and insert it into your computer for easy transferring of items. It has been great to me so far!

"I have read all of the 50 Shades of Grey books, so I felt like it was necessary for me to read this book. As much as I loved the original series, I was a tad bit disappointed with this one. I was expecting it to dive deeper into Christian's thoughts and views, but it only let in a little bit. It did explain some things, and I like that it went into his dreams a little bit more, but I feel like I already knew what was happening because, well, it was the same as the first book, it just happened to be a little bit different. It was still a good read, and I am glad I read it. I hope she releases parts to match up with the other two books, because I still have way too many questions.

I figured it would get a hole in it easily or would fall apart. To much of a surprise, I have had no issues with the trash bags falling apart or anything of that sort!

The quality of this wooden play set is amazing-- they are painted perfectly AND they do not contain led-- perfectly safe for littles to play with!

The bottom of this bottle screws off, and you are able to keep supplements or powder in the bottom section so you can easily have a second drink readily available. It is secure, and does not come apart easily. It also is really easy to clean. It is dishwasher safe, but I prefer to hand wash it because its quicker.

The actual grating of cheese is easy too-- it is sharp (but not so sharp you have to worry about slicing off your fingers) and it grates it perfectly.

"I really like this bracelet! The paracord is a REALLY strong material, so this can hold up to just about anything! The size it came in was too big for my wrists, but I have REALLY small wrists. I handed it over to my brother to try out and it fit him perfectly! He has worn it for a couple days and it has not even frayed one bit! Let me tell you-- this boy is ROUGH, so the fact that he hasn't broken it says something! He loves the colors, as they are are neutral and he can wear it with anything!

"This bracelet is absolutely adorable! It is really comfortable, and fits pretty well on my wrist! You can actually untie it, then retie it so it fits your wrist! I have really small wrists, so I kept it small so it doesn't fall off my wrist! I love the colors, they definitely add a POP!

"Living in Arizona makes it almost a necessity to have blackout curtains! I used this particular one in my own room, which allows my room to stay dark and cooler. With the sun blaring in through the window, my room would usually heat up pretty fast. When I put this blackout curtain up, I was able to prevent the sun blaring in my room. It effectively blocked out the sun, and prevented my room to be bright as can be. Now nap times during the day can go uninterrupted from the sun! These are flexible as well, which is another great thing-- who likes stiff curtains!? I sure don't! These are machine washable, so no need to worry about dry cleaning your curtains!

These are recommended for 3+ years, but my daughter who is younger than that has been playing with them (under adult supervision, of course).

"This serum comes in an adorable bottle with a really nice dropper. It looks elegant, which I love, because if I leave it on my bathroom counter, it still looks fabulous! After using it for a while, I have fallen in love. I have noticed with some vitamin c serums, my face will get really oily, which causes me to break out. However, with this face serum, my face has not gotten oily AND it hasn't broken out (huge plus in my book!). I have not reached the age where wrinkles are appearing, however, this does get rid of fine lines. I had my mother test it out as well, and she instantly fell in love with it. It has reduced her ""crows feet"" and has made her skin look perfect. It is easy to use, and can be applied underneath makeup! The smell is normal-- it doesn't stick and it doesn't have an unbearable scent either!

"This wine opener is absolutely awesome! It is stainless steel, which I personally love, due to the fact that all my appliances are stainless steel-- it fits right in! Of course, when I got this I new that I needed to grab a few bottles of wine to give it a try! It worked GREAT! It was easy to use, and it has a foil cutter on there, so you don't need a corkscrew AND knife to get a bottle of wine open! It folds up nicely, and not to mention unfolds nicely as well. It is in no way difficult to use, and makes life so much easier having it all in one nifty tool! The corkscrew is sturdy, and has not bent nor broken on me. The foil cutter is nice and sharp, but it isn't overly sharp-- no worrying about slicing fingers off! I am very pleased with this wine opener, and it has made a wonderful addition to my kitchen!

"Summer has quickly approaced us here in the sunny state of Arizona. With that being said, sandals will be worn, and feet must look pretty and be soft! (Who likes nasty feet hanging out by the pool?!) I decided that I would give this exfoliating foot peeling mask a try, in hopes that my feet would be silky smooth after. I am beyond thrilled that it actually worked! It is really simple to use and comes with great instructions. Keep in mind, this is a 7 day process. It doesn't happen over night, so you have to be sure to keep up with it the entire 7 days. It causes your feel to peel (as it is a peeling mask) and underneath the dead skin peeling off, comes silky, soft, new feet! My feet have been incredibly smooth and I owe it all to this mask!

"Snoring. It's something that we all have faced at some point in our lives. It may be us snoring, or it could be a family member. Either way, snoring has been destroying sleep for a lifetime. This little clip came in and I immediately handed it to my father. Let me tell you, that man snores so loud I have a hard time falling asleep... and we are on DIFFERENT floors of our house! He told me he would give it a try, to see if it would help. Let me tell you, this helped him so much! He said that it was in no way uncomfortable, as we had thought it may be due to it being a plastic clip. He has had no issues with pain from this clip! It opened up his air passages and his snoring went down a LOT. It did not completely get rid of the snoring, but it was minimized, which had all of us in the house jumping for joy not having to hear the loud bear sleeping downstairs.

"I am going to be honest-- these gummies don't taste like candy, but if they did, it would be a problem for me and my family! When I got these in, I was really excited to give them a try. I have a difficult time swallowing some multi-vitamins because they are so large. With these gummies, I don't have to worry about that! The taste isn't awful, it's completely tolerable, and I don't have to swallow a massive pill. I can chew these up and be on my way! They are not overly sticky either, which is something I have faced in the past with other gummies. Sure, they may stick to your teeth a little (what gummy doesn't?), but they don't get stuck and stay.

I decided to try them on a night when I knew I would be able to sleep in the next morning for lack of sleep during the night. I chewed up 2 of the gummies, and crawled into bed to watch some TV. Let me tell you, after taking these gummies, I got the best sleep of my entire life. They worked fast, and they helped me fall asleep.

"This wallet has become my new favorite wallet! It is a cute size, and it holds everything I need in it! It has a section for cards, and a section for money. The zipper works great on both sides-- however, as fair warning, on the money side, be sure you have it tucked in, and don't let the zipper get stuck on it. It is a HUGE pain to get it unstuck, but it was COMPLETELY my fault for not paying attention! This wallet is more than just a wallet-- it protects your cards. There is a new thing going around where people simply walk by you and can steal your card information-- which allows them to use your cards and rack up a huge bill. This wallet helps prevent that.

There is nothing worse than dried out skin, which is what I often find myself struggling with.

"I have come across a new obsession-- I love infuser bottles! When these bottles first started appearing around town, I was a little confused as to why people would use infusers, rather than just a regular water bottle. Then, infusers came into my life. I realized that not having nasty pulp in your mouth, or seeds from the fruit, is the best thing ever! This bottle is seriously SO easy to use and clean. All you do is unscrew the cap, take out the middle part, fill it with yummy fruit of your choice, fill bottle with water, insert said fruit in the middle part back into the water bottle, screw on lid, and enjoy! I love making a bottle in the morning, placing it in the fridge for a few hours, then drinking it in the afternoon.

"When it comes to pet odor and stains, my family is a little too familiar. Last night, my cat decided that it was necessary to throw up on our not-even-a-year-old carpet. After cleaning up the mess, I remembered that I had received this in the mail, so of course, I had to test it out! I was really surprised by how well it worked. As you can imagine, vomit is not the most delightful smell in the world. This took the stank right out, and it was SUPER easy to use!

"I am no watch repairman, however, my brother absolutely loves tinkering with old watches from family and trying to get them up and running again. He always just used tools we had around the house, but once I got this set in, he was so excited because he would be able to have the correct tools! This repair tool kit comes with everything you may need any more! The added hammer is a great bonus too! It comes with 14 pieces, including the hammer, and all of them are in perfect condition. It all looks exactly as shown in the picture, and comes exactly as described. I was confused by a few parts, so I had to look up a few items to make sure they were being used correctly, but after showing some videos with my brother, we had it down pat! This kit has everything you may need for repairing a watch!

"This kitchen scale is GREAT! I have recently gotten into cooking more different meals, and I noticed a lot of times recipes call for weight, rather than a cup, 1/2 cup, etc. I was frantic the first time I saw a recipe with this, because I did not have a kitchen scale. Once I got this in, I decided to try it out and see how well it actually worked. To my surprise, it was right on! I love being able to weigh all the different foods I may have-- steaks, fruit, veggies.... The list goes on! I have had no issues with it, and I have been using it every single day for the past few days! It looks sleek and nice on my counter, and is small enough so it doesn't make a cluttered mess! I have stainless steel and black appliances, so this fits in perfectly!

"I am not the most tech savvy person on the planet, so when I got this in, I had to call a friend for some assistance. For starters, it is REALLY small. I didn't realize that something so awesome could come in such a tiny little thing! Once it was all plugged in and ready to go, I felt like I had my own personal ""hot spot"" with no added pains or high bills to go along with it! It is really easy to set up once you have it all plugged in. You can go in and change your settings to whatever you may wish for it. The instructions are pretty easy to follow, but like I said, I had to call for assistance because I am not good with a lot of tech stuff. It is really great and convenient, especially when traveling!

"After looking at all the reviews on this item, I am curious if updates have been made to it, because I have had no issues with it so far! It is light in weight, which is great because I don't have to feel like I am carrying a brick every place I go. I have had no issues with the screen cracking, however, I take very good care of my electronics, and I always place them in cases and/or keep them in safe spots where cracking is not an option. It connected to my WiFi just fine, and never glitched out on me once. I will tell you, however, you cannot overload the tablet with a ton of apps and games. Once your memory gets low (like any other electronic on the market) it starts to slow down. So, if you are sure to not overload it with tons of apps, photos, music, etc-- you should be fine! I love the pink color too-- it is beautiful, fun, and vibrant! It charges easily, but be sure to not leave it charging all night, as that can destroy the battery (again, just like any other electronic). I like to restart it once a week, so it continues to run smoothly, and I am sure to check for updates as needed. I have yet to have any issues with this tablet, and I love it! I let my daughter play a couple games on it, and it works great! It came with all the cords that you may need as well! I love having an Android tablet because I can connect to the Google Play Store and have all my stuff from my phone be able to be transferred onto there. Overall, I am beyond pleased with this, and like I said, I have had a MUCH different experience than others with this tablet-- I have had nothing but positives!-Received for the purpose of my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11H2A7S775Q8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RHAIGSE#wasThisHelpful","R11H2A7S775Q8X","AD9JPNVX2COPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD9JPNVX2COPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here is an author who truly knows her subject. In addition, she has consulted some very respectable works to enhance her booklet. At a time there is no âmainstream Americanâ any more, she addresses the issue of World English speakers. English in different parts of the world differ, different parts of US differ, different dialects of any given language differ, and variability within different dialects differs. The author encourages awareness of the implications of dialect differences in education. Schools have not satisfactorily addressed these issues. The added complication of dialect diversity as a result of new immigrants should also be considered, whether they speak their English dialect or whether they do not speak any English.The sections on Dialectology and developing educational policies are well thought-out by the author.Too bad this booklet is out-of-print.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJU5Y7HZ6KN9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006QXSHA#wasThisHelpful","RJU5Y7HZ6KN9W","A1J9SUX6DLLADK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J9SUX6DLLADK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author has made every effort to simplify the extremely detailed South Indian cooking that can be challenging for the beginner. She recommends only the most essential spices to make curry powders and mixes.The Indian ancestors used a lot more spices in almost every dish. Their preparations were time-consuming, but they took the time. Good cooking generally takes time, but the patience and efforts pay.This great cook/author provides varieties of sub-recipes within each group of dishes. For example, there are 11 types of dosais described with ingredients and recipes, with colorful photos. The photos in this book are as much a treat as the recipes themselves.For the beginner and pro, here is a wealth of ideas, creative and authentic. Attempting a book on the intricate South Indian cooking is no easy task, but the author and her helpers have done an exemplary job.For the global vegetarian, this can be a great reference manual. Vegans can modify the  recipes easily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GOH620DBL82K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0207184771#wasThisHelpful","R2GOH620DBL82K","A1J9SUX6DLLADK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J9SUX6DLLADK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why did this already controversial author bother to make this amateur attempt? So that she can vent herself and express some misplaced anger?She is a professor at a reputable university? How did that happen?Obviously, she has no concept of time and space. She wants to judge an ancient culture and civilization with her narrow-minded values and 21st century standards. If all she wants to do is throw mud at time-honored ancient accomplishments, there are plenty of old civilizations that she can attack and bad-mouth. I wonder who/what is her next target. Her prejudice knows no bounds.Totally misinformed and sadly mistaken about the essence of the Vedas, Upanishads, epics, traditions and lineages, the author keeps on making arrogant statements throughout her work. She has no respect for the authenticity of traditions and lineages, and does not seem to understand what makes an epic, tradition or lineage. She has completely omitted not only the major Upanishads but other important scriptures. Some of her criticisms are as silly as, for example, if explorer Columbus is put down because he could not drive an automobile!If the author has so much doubt such as if Mahabharata is an epic or if Sankaracharya is the head of the tradition, why did she even spend her precious time writing this fat book? She certainly has wasted the reader's time.What is her source? She has not substantiated any claim she has made. The chapter on Hinduism in America should never have been published. Here she shows that she has not done her homework and that she is an outsider, a frog in the well (a common Indian expression) who has not seen the world outside of the well but writing a book about that world. She has proved that she is just an outsider who has no clue on Hinduism in America or ancient and modern Hinduism.The author's ignorance, lack of direct experience with the culture, scorn, pettiness, convenient omissions, and oblivion to the times of her subject come through very well. What does not come through is the subject itself.There are many huge factual errors in this book, Wendy owes an apology to her readers.Do not waste your money on this book. If you are curious, borrow it from a library.Wendy needs to find another hobby.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OIZGKQS90E34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HB9H98#wasThisHelpful","R2OIZGKQS90E34","A1J9SUX6DLLADK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J9SUX6DLLADK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an easy, approachable account of lifeâs experiences, happy, sad, and humiliating, along with lessons learned, put together in an entertaining read by this all American young author. He chooses to give a candid profile of himself with his very expressive vocabulary skills. He is not shy about sharing what many people will hide from the world. Comedy is tragedy + time, and his âtragediesâ have probably become comedies by now.The author is a 30-ish, Oklahoma school teacher, husband, father, knowledgeable in American sports in general, especially basketball. The most appropriate readers for these anecdotes are those who grew up in America, who will understand the slang and cultural expressions generously spread out throughout the book. The under 35 readers will identify with him more than other age groups. Sports fans and childhood sports participants will enjoy this memoir immensely.The book is full of funny, embarrassing, as well as unfortunate incidents well-described with the authorâs unique style. It will make the reader laugh and cry at the same time. Whether he reminisces Edward the palm tree, the âforeignâ culture of California surfers, the amazing effects of ice baths, or his young student with no pinkies, he makes his point extremely well. His readers will look forward to more short stories from him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REZKKUF32FC3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615961770#wasThisHelpful","REZKKUF32FC3P","A1J9SUX6DLLADK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J9SUX6DLLADK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For those who have read much of Cayce, and visited Hopkinsville museum or Virginia Beach A.R.E (Association for Research and Enlightenment), this program may not have anything new to offer, but for others, it offers a wealth of information.Why this prophet is not nearly as famous as he should be, is an important question.

"The author has touched on an issue that has been around from ancient times. Throughout history, many independent and financially secure women have either stayed single or left a bad marriage, and raised children without a man's involvement and support. Women who are not financially independent have felt stuck and have stayed in abusive marriages. It is not always easy to leave. Times and values have seemingly changed, and women do see themselves as strong individuals. The author is highly encouraging women to see their strength and be independent.In the areas of the world of ancient cultures and hard-to-get-rid of old values, women are not privileged, and future of young girls is still decided by parents and the society. If things go wrong, the same parents and society who got her `trapped' may or may not support her.The author's points are great for the woman who has established herself as emotionally and financially independent. The encouragement is also helpful for the `stuck' woman and mother who must truly struggle to become independent in every level. Luckily, today's girls are raised to become career women of freedom.The book does not pretend to answer all complex questions, but serves as a good read for men and women to think through issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAL2X8SBFAQBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804104107#wasThisHelpful","RAL2X8SBFAQBN","A1J9SUX6DLLADK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J9SUX6DLLADK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We, the grandkids and I, love this book. They are 8 and 9 years old and like nothing better than to be in the kitchen helping to make stuff. The recipes are easy for both of them to read. The photos are clear and bright. Ingredients are real food, with no artificial colors or flavors. We liked making the  ninja turtle nuggets and the tomato and fresh basil skewers. We have planted a large garden and both kids can identify lots of kitchen herbs. They grow several types of mints which will be used at decoration for the lemonade drinks in the book. Their favorite part of the book is the rating pages at the back. It is a chart listing the recipe, the page it is found on, date made, notes and a yes/no choice to make it again or not. My grandkids love trying new things and rating them. They gave this book a five star and asked me to order the lunch book by the same author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6HOR3M9K2IJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592336612#wasThisHelpful","RY6HOR3M9K2IJ","A1XFI340SHOS5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XFI340SHOS5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very cute little sweater. I like the plain navy blue with the trim. The trim looks more gray against the blue than white. It had four large buttons, easy for little hands to manage. No pockets and it has navy blue patches at the elbows. Look perfect with khaki pants. The sweater is light weight, just right for Spring and Fall here in the Northeast US. Not heavy enough for Winter. The tag says, ""School Sweater"", so I am thinking it is acceptable as an ad on for school uniforms. My size 5/6 fits a second grader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8UMI34TFK8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D01CQ8A#wasThisHelpful","R3N8UMI34TFK8G","A1XFI340SHOS5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XFI340SHOS5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an historical fiction novel, however all over the world this same sort of human trafficking is still occurring. Girls are sold into slavery and prostitution, treated as property and discarded when no longer profitable. I was enthralled by the authors attention to detail. In the first pages she tells of an execution. The family and friends know that they have no control, there are no courts, lawyers or ways to combat wrongful accusations. The best they can do is use their last coin to pay the swordsman to sharpen his weapon so the slice will be swift and merciful. The entire tale pulls you in, wanting to help the young girl, feeling her pain, yet not wanting to read the details. It's like watching a horror movie through your fingers. You want to look away but can't. I will be looking forward to more books by Ms. Curry. This is a peak into the darker side of Chinese culture and history.

"Growing up we always played ping pong in summer school, in the garage and at the local youth center. The paddles were always green, splintered and wavy. This heavy weight , thickly padded paddle is 100% better than what I have ever used. This would make a fine gift for any serious player and would surly improve the game of anyone using the old green paddles. I wonder how Bruce Lee would have played with this paddle, seeing what he can do with a pair of nunchuks.

"I've had the opportunity to use several speck products and I like them all. This case is very functional and great looking. It is a combination of both hard (black) and soft (green) material. It makes the perfect combination for the phone to be easily slipped into and out of a purse or pocket, yet the ridges allow a nice firm grip and it does not slide off of a dashboard. The raised side buttons protect the volume controls and the bezel raised ridge prevents the screen from smacking a surface in the event of a fall. I also love the packaging that Speck products come in. They mail them in thick, plain brown boxes for protection, yet when you open the box the blue logo brightens up the inside and red tissue paper wraps the product.

"This style iron worked very well on my hair. The only caveat being that I could not use it myself. My daughter styled my hair and it did a good job. I am not coordinated enough to get good results on my own head. The rotating barrel gets very hot and you have to be sure to use the guard so you don't burn yourself. My hair is gray, thin and fine so we were very careful not to overdo and not leave the heat in one spot for too long. It is called a wet to dry iron, however it takes forever if your hair is wet. This works much better on dry hair with a bit of spritz of heat styling gel. The set comes with a comb and a nice storage/travel bag. Go to the web site myinstyler.com and view the many helpful video tips. One thing I learned from one of the videos is that this can be used on hair extensions, only if they are human hair. The InStyler will melt synthetic hair extentions. Also, do not place the barrel too near the root of your hair if you do have extensions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11JFPG8XT904/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOJ8V5I#wasThisHelpful","R11JFPG8XT904","A1XFI340SHOS5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XFI340SHOS5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that I am spastic when it comes to styling hair. Every one of this style iron/curler gets tangled in my hair. This was no exception. My hair is thin and fine and I was hoping to get a little lift and volume by wrapping the hair around the bristles. I got myself tangled up but the good feature is that the heating element is inside the brush and I did not burn myself when trying to extract my hair. The reason for four stars instead of one is that I had my nine year old granddaughter use it on me and she had much better results. She sectioned the hair in small parts and was able to create a little life. The unit has low, high and off settings.

"We have several manual laborers in our household and I run a kung fu school. On any given day, someone is sore and achy. This ball was delivered on a cool spring day, and right out of the box it felt good on shoulder muscles. You can pop the ball out of the holder by pushing up on the bottom and chill it in the freezer for at least two hours. It is not to be used on kids under 14. Teens up to 18 should use under supervision. Be sure to read the enclosed flyer. You don't just grab the ball and rub it around. Some techniques are different. For instance, you can lay on your side and hold the ball firmly on a spot on your thigh and then bend and flex your knee and lower leg. The ball stays in one place, the muscle changes position.  It does a nice job of kneading tight muscles. The only thing I did not see anywhere in the literature was instructions for cleaning the unit in between use. I don't know if you wash in water and dry, use alcohol wipes or some other method. I would think in a gym situation with body sweat it would get nasty if used often. The ball is stainless steel and the grip some sort of rubber. I'm sure it can be cleaned, I just don't know the process.

She is afraid of dogs in general, so this little one was a nice way for me to begin a conversation with her about animals. We put a birthday party hat on my giant mastiff and he sat very still for the dress up. We like the way the legs on the girl bend and even gave her a ride on my live dog.

"This set is good for a quick fix. Perhaps a second bathroom, a kids bath, a first apartment or someone in a new house, not yet ready to commit to a quality bath set. The soap dish, cup and curtain rings are plastic. The soap dish does have holes to drain water, but does not have a tray underneath to catch the water. It makes a mess if you use it on the counter top instead of a ledge in the shower. The curtain is bright and cheery, yet not so thick that it makes the shower dark when closed. Something to consider if your bath tub/shower does not have a light in it. The curtain is polyester and so it washes well and dries quickly. I always like to use a clear, plastic shower liner to keep the curtains cleaner, but it is not necessary. The holes in the curtain are sewn button hole types, not grommets. They are sturdy but there are only 11 holes and 12 hooks. Doesn't bother me, but for more obsessive types they may find the extra hook a problem, especially if you use a liner.

"This is a beautiful watch and makes a nice fashion statement. Bright gold with a black frame and just the tiny pink logo for accent. I have small frame arms and wrists and the watch fits me nicely just out of the box, however it does appear heavy on my small wrist. The 3, 6 and 9 are marked with numbers, the 12 with a pink spade and the rest of the hours and minutes are show by lines. The face of the watch is bright gold. Mine came packed in a very pretty red, blue and gold gift box. It was nestled on a white foam cushion.  Perfect for gift giving. My watch was set at the proper time and running, directly out of the box. If you are looking to make a fashion statement and have lots of shiny, yet classy gold showing, then this is a beautiful piece. I received my watch as a review piece from Vine and am very happy with it. I will wear it on all dress-up occasions. One feature that I would have chosen if I bought this watch is a backlight for nighttime viewing. There is no built in light, making it very hard to read the gold on gold lines in dim light.

Of course, washing clothes in very hot water and hanging them with wooden pins on a line outside in the fresh air and breeze is, in my opinion, still the best way to go. If you don't have the time or inclination, then just toss these in the load of wash and bring a little baby scent to your day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QY6ASEPP7FA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMWNRQ#wasThisHelpful","R37QY6ASEPP7FA","A1XFI340SHOS5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XFI340SHOS5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Colgate has been a staple in our house for decades. This Optic White Platinum has a clean refreshing taste of mint. It does a good job of cleaning the teeth and gives a nice shine to the enamel. It foams when brushing, but not excessively. The paste is smooth, not gritty like some whitening products. This product is a part of a system of pen, mouthwash and toothpaste. I would assume that you get the best results using all three. Since I am kind of ""Long In the Tooth"" and have sixty plus years of wear and tear on my mouth, I did not see much difference in the whiteness after the suggested three days. Use twice a day, but do not use on children under 2 years of age.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R239Q3IUX8S9G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDNIWBY#wasThisHelpful","R239Q3IUX8S9G9","A1XFI340SHOS5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XFI340SHOS5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very soothing on ruff skin. Our family is prone to eczema and it gets worse in the winter months. Curel is easy to apply, is not sticky and does not stain. We shower with warm water, pat dry instead of rubbing and then apply to warm, moist skin. My grown daughter and small granddaughter both agree that it helps with elbows and knees. We use this and another well known product ""Euc---n"". Both help get through the long, dry winter months. There is no scent, which makes for another plus.

"Pantene has always been a favorite product of mine. It feels like a salon treatment. The light yellow/cream colored lotion is easy to spread through the hair and has a great fresh scent. My hair is dry and fly-a-way and this gives it a nice body and volume. My only con comment would be the need to wait for several minutes before rinsing the product out. If you are getting a beauty salon treatment, it's not a problem, they apply, wrap your head and later you lay back in the chair and they rinse. When you are a ""bath"" type person, still no problem, you apply, sit back on your bath pillow, read a book and then rinse. The issue becomes with ""shower"" people. You apply, turn off the water so you don't waste gallons and gallons of fresh water, hum a few songs, get a little chilly then futz around with the water temperature and rinse out. Just a general though about all rinse out conditioners, I wish they could be made to stay in the hair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG1CV4Y2AKXSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OFXLF0W#wasThisHelpful","RG1CV4Y2AKXSM","A1XFI340SHOS5K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XFI340SHOS5K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The think I like most about this mouse is that it works on my Plexiglas desk top cover. No need to drag out a pad or mat. This has a lower profile than the HP mouse that came with my PC, and it will take a few hours to get used to. It connected on the first attempt, which is a plus for someone like me who is not tech savvy. It tracks perfectly and is ambidextrous. Very portable and easy to tuck into my travel bag.

"This book is a sequel to Crazy Rich Asians and unfortunately when I started reading the first few chapters I got the feeling that it was a book I had already read. More super rich, super shallow, over the top characters who just don't fit in my everyday world, except that they remind me of too many people in the news today. Entitled, uncaring, selfish, secret e-mails, bribes, phoniness, it's just all to sad.

"It's hard to find any products that are free of GMO's artificial colors and unnecessary chemicals.  I was very happy with the list of things that are not added to these vitamins. I know I could use more fiber, B vitamins and  Omegas in my daily routine. Some Omega caps are very large and hard to swallow and some have a pronounced fishy taste. Since these are gummy style, it is easier to get them down and they are not fishy in flavor. They have a natural sweetness to them. Although they contain an nice amount of vitamins, I would not call them complete by any stretch of the imagination. The container comes with a childproof cap which is a good thing, since they are marketed to look like a kids gummy with a cartoon owl and a baby sounding name, Smarty Pants. I really don't like the mix of childish labeling on an adult product, too much chance of kids trying to get to it. I will keep them in the refrigerator so they don't oxidize.

"This is so easy to use that it is a pleasure. The base is heavy and solid but the trays are light and easy to clean in the kitchen sink. (they don't fit flat, but I can stand them on edge in my standard size sink and hose them down after use). For my first experiment I did two trays of strawberries, sliced in 1/4"" thick pieces, a 1/2  tray of banana slices and half of lemon and lime slices and one tray of pineapple chunks. I set the dehydrator on 6 hours and 135 degrees. After the first hour of running, the entire room smelled like strawberries. Delicious scent on the first day of Spring after this long snowy winter. The unit only has two dials. I used the shallow trays, but there are spacer trays included if you need to dry thicker or taller food. You push the time button to power on the unit and set the hour then dial up the temperature on the other knob. Very simple to use. The unit hums when working, kind of like a small, personal heater sounds. It does give off some warm steam, which may be a problem in summer if you have a small kitchen. I have mine running in a converted garage , mainly because it has a large footprint and does not fit on my small kitchen counter. You do have to check on your food frequently and remove the pieces that are done. I love this unit and can't wait to use it for my produce from my large garden. Herbs, tomatoes, greens. Just be sure not to mix sweet fruits with potent garlic or onion slices. I will store the dried foods using my Seal-A-Meal unit. Hoping to eat healthier and more organically this year.

"I love having toys in the bedroom, I feel they are a great way to add a little something to ones sex life. I have a little collection of favorites, so I was anxious to see if this toy would earn a spot in my ""toy box"".Like so many, the battery size kinda threw me off. Most of my toys use 2 AA batteries, however this one requires 2 AAA batteries. I thought immediately that this toy wouldn't have much... well... zing. Boy oh boy was I wrong! This toy is comfortable to use, and has a very nice shape to it. It is designed for clitoral stimulation, but also the way the main shaft is shaped, it can also stimulate your g-spot. The toy has a hard silicone feel, not too soft, not too hard. Juuuuust right! It has 2 buttons, one for on/off and the other to go thru the functions.I like how this toy felt, and it did provide a great deal of pleasure. However there are a few things that I would change. One is the size. It is one of the smaller toys that I own. I think if it was 2 inches longer and a inch wider in girth this would be the ultimate toy. I also don't like the placement of the buttons. When you are in the middle, its easy for a finger to slip and off goes the toy. I like toys with switches on the top of the toy, and not on the side.Overall this is a nice toy, and definitely something I would recommend for beginners or couples who just want a little extra.Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CEOZ60IB4HUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQCR8C8#wasThisHelpful","R3CEOZ60IB4HUU","A2BM0K1XK4O2OX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BM0K1XK4O2OX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These heat sealers are honestly such a fantastic product to have in the kitchen! I like to have chips, and snacks, however I hate that I can never seal them up well. I either use bag holders, ties, clothespins, or what have you. Air can still get into the bags and make my food go bad a lot faster, which is a waste of money.These are so handy! Just pop in a battery, move the shield, and you are ready to go. I found the best way to use this is to start off slow, and find the speed that works well with the type of plastic you are sealing. Some plastics seal a lot faster and don't require the slow speed. Others take a bit longer, so it's really trial by error. Once I got the hang of these, I was able to seal a bag up in seconds and have a full seal with one swipe. At the beginning, it would take me a few go overs to get the bag fully sealed!These do have a magnetic back, but I found that they are way to heavy to put on the fridge. They just slide down to the floor. So I keep mine on top of the fridge for safe keeping. I also wouldn't recommend children using this since it is melting plastic.Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTL0QW4VJY68C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HW3874#wasThisHelpful","RTL0QW4VJY68C","A2BM0K1XK4O2OX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BM0K1XK4O2OX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have quite a few brushes in my collection, at least 25+. Washing day can get quite crazy to say the least! I like to wash my brushes with baby shampoo, and normally I would wash them with my fingers and the back of my hand. When I was given the chance to try out the Scrub Shell, I happily obliged! I could use something to help brush cleaning day go a bit faster, and provide a better clean.The day it arrived at my home, I had to try it out, so 4 days early my brushes got their bi-weekly wash! The shell has 2 scrubbing surfaces that work well with all sorts of brushes and fibers. I find that my eye shadow brushes and smaller tipped brushes work best at the top with the small silicone bristles. They really provide a deep clean. The bottom half with the ridges works wonders for my larger foundation, blush and kabuki brushes. It kinda reminds me of a old laundry washboard! I will say the Scrub Shell does make cleaning my brushes a lot easier, and faster. I was surprised at how much additional makeup was coming out of my brushes. It really does give a deep clean.I only have 1 slight issue with the Scrub Shell. It is awkward to hold onto when you are trying to wash your brushes. I would really love if this had a handle of some sort, or perhaps even a suction cup base. The shell is hollow inside, so you can put your fingers in the shell hold it in place while you use your other hand to wash. However it just felt awkward. I was going to try and snap a photo of this process, but because I don't have a hand free, I couldn't capture the cleaning process. That is my only complaint.

I personally would have liked these to be in a brush roll, it makes safely storing and travelling with brushes so much easier.The brushes themselves are pretty good. There is a brush for every type of need you might have. My personal favorite is the stippling brush. I love how it works with my liquid foundation! The brushes are soft, and feel nice on the skin. They don't have any strong smells that some synthetic brushes can have. I have only had very minor shedding with these brushes on their first wash. Other than that, no real shedding when applying makeup. I wash my brushes with baby shampoo, and these held up find during washing.This kit is pretty basic, and would be a great starter kit for someone new to makeup, teens, or even for pros who want to add more brushes to their collections.

All you do is unhook the clasp, then pull the bracelet in opposite directions. You don't have to pull too hard. Once you do that it opens and you can put it on your wrist. It is also fairly easy to put on by yourself as well.Overall very nice bracelet, just be sure to read up on how to use the clasp if you are unfamiliar with this type of closure.Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V5UMW36FA0XX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGDOYVG#wasThisHelpful","R3V5UMW36FA0XX","A2BM0K1XK4O2OX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BM0K1XK4O2OX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am the type of person who hates to iron. I have never been a fan of it. This was my first time using a steamer to get rid of wrinkles in my clothes, so I was pretty anxious to see how well it would work.This device is easy to operate. Just a few simple steps to get started and you are ready to steam your clothes. I used this on some dress slacks, denim, cotton tops, and dressy blouses. They all came out wrinkle free. I also decided to try it out on my curtains, which are a pain in the rear to iron. Within a few minutes my curtains were wrinkle free, and crisp looking.I like that this device makes getting rid of wrinkles in your fabrics super simple. It takes hardly any effort! I'm a on the go working gal, so if I can find ways to get household chores done quicker, you best believe I will take advantage of them!This gets a full 5 star recommendation from me.

"These packing cubes are without a doubt fantastic! I like that you are supplied with bags that are different sizes. This makes packing all sorts of things super easy. These are great for keeping your suitcase organized while travelling, or you can use them around the house to keep things in their place. I like to use these in my closet and under my bed for storage. They fit perfectly! They have so many uses, and so many different situations where these come in handy!The bags are nicely made. I haven't had any problems with the zippers sticking at all. No ripping or tearing. The color is vibrant and rich.It's also nice that they give you a laundry bag and a sleeping mask. Again, if you are travelling these are 2 terrific things to have with you! The sleeping mask I really enjoy, it blocks out light and really helps me get a nice nights sleep! The laundry bag is on the small side, however if you are using it while travelling, or perhaps at the beach, it will suffice.Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB9WFVYZS1LB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VQDC3Y#wasThisHelpful","RB9WFVYZS1LB0","A2BM0K1XK4O2OX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BM0K1XK4O2OX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned a few copper magnetic bracelets, however most of them just weren't pretty to look at. The first thing that drew me to this bracelet was the design on it. This sets it apart from other copper magnetic bracelets and gives it a nice appeal. You can wear this with any outfit and it will look terrific! The bracelet is easy to put on, and you can adjust it to perfectly fit your wrist. My wrists are slightly on the larger side, and this fit me no problem. A few minor adjustments and it was perfect!I have a job that uses my hands a lot, and it is very repetitious. Carpal tunnel is something that I am proactive in trying to prevent. So when I am at work I wear this bracelet. It not only helps my hands and wrist be comfortable, but it also helps eliminate back pain. Because I have used copper magnetic bracelets before, I know the proper ways to wear them, and which wrist to wear it on for which ailment. If you are unfamiliar with this, definitely do some research before wearing. You will get a good understanding of how these work, and how to have them perform top notch!So far I really like this bracelet. Not only does it work well, but is is very fashionable as well! I don't think there are any changes I would make to this bracelet, it seems 5 star worthy in my book!Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10X8F7P083MXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149VAU6E#wasThisHelpful","R10X8F7P083MXG","A2BM0K1XK4O2OX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BM0K1XK4O2OX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I absolutely love these snack bars! Out of all the flavors, my favorite is the coconut and banana. These bars are great for snacks at home, at work, or just on the go. They have nice flavors, and I love the flavor combos that they have. These sort of remind me of cereal bars in a way. They are light, so you can eat one and not have that heavy feel that you can sometimes get from granola bars and other health bars.I am on a weight loss journey, so these are fantastic alternatives to have when I am hungry, and want to reach for something good!Overall I am a fan of these, they taste great, and make a perfect snack!Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN24Z4BDVZ5L7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K13CLE4#wasThisHelpful","RN24Z4BDVZ5L7","A2BM0K1XK4O2OX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BM0K1XK4O2OX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A family member of mine loves to knit, but I noticed that she just would keep her yarn and knitting tools in a plastic grocery bag. The kitting needles would always poke through the bags and fall out. Her yarn would get tangled. It just wasn't the ideal set up. The minute this Yarn Storage Bag arrived at my door, I gave it to her to try out. She was able to put a couple yarn rolls inside the bag, and bring the yarn she was working with up thru the opening at the top of the bag. She could knit without her yarn getting tangled, and everything was right in its bag. There are pockets for knitting needles, and other accessories she uses. It is fantastic!She said that she loves how neat it keeps her knitting tools and yarn spools. Being that it's all in a bag, she said that it makes travelling with it so easy. She can knit anywhere.

"I have to say that I absolutely love this coconut oil from Island Fresh! I use this in so many ways. Let's go thru some of my favorite uses!- Cooking - I love using this in my cooking and baking needs. I use this in replacement of butter and oils, and my foods come out tasting great. It has a very subtle coconut flavor, which in some dishes you can really bring out the flavor, however in most cases, you really don't even taste it.- Hair Care - I use this along with a few other oils to make my own hair conditioning mask. Simply combine my favorite oils, apply to my hair, and I will let it sit on my hair over night. When I wake up in the morning I will have shiny, soft, smooth, sleek hair! Plus it smells fantastic too!- Skin Care - This is a great oil to use on your face and body. I like to use this as a bi-weekly treatment on my face. I will mix this with my favorite moisturizer, and apply it to my skin. It adds that extra nourishment to my skin! And again, it smells great!- Massage Oil - Finally, I love using this as a massage oil. It melts easily in your hands, and provides a nice slip on the body. You can add in some essential oils with the coconut oil to give a bit of aromatherapy.The size of this jar honestly surprised me, it is huge! I won't be running out of coconut oil anytime soon! If you love coconut oil, or are wanting to try it for the first time, I definitely recommend purchasing!

I have to say that I was honestly shocked at how well this product performed!I have a home with 20 year old carpets, and pets. So between foot traffic, and all the messes that pets can make, my carpets have been through it all. I had a few stains on my carpets that were old, and I had 2 that were fresh. I followed the directions on the bottle, and sprayed this on them. After drying and vacuuming, I was shocked at how well this had worked. On the fresh stains, it was as if they had never existed. With the old stains, it brought my carpet back to its original color! I now go around the house looking for old stains other products couldn't touch, and use this on them!

"I have been taking Biotin for years. It is one of my tried and true supplements. I color my hair regularly, so my hair get's damaged quite a bit. To help combat this damage, and help my hair grow a lot faster, I will take Biotin daily. Within a week of use, I notice a huge difference in my hair. For the past month I have been using the Life Glow Biotin, and my hair has been growing at a much faster rate. It also is a lot shinier, and overall healthier looking. Now, this doesn't only effect my hair, but also my nails. Again, within the first week of use my nails will start growing at a much faster rate. So it's a double whammy!There is only 1 con to Biotin, and that is it makes your hair grow... all of your hair. I notice that my other body hair will grow much faster as well, (under arms, legs, etc). So I do have to do my hair removal in those places a bit more frequently than normal.

"I have 2 cats in my home, so I have 2 cat boxes for them in different areas of my home. They are ALWAYS tracking cat litter out of the box and onto the floor. This drives me crazy! This mat though is a saver! As soon as my cats come out of the box, it collects the pieces of cat litter from their paws and traps it. Also if your cats are like mine and tend to accidentally fling cat litter out of the box, this will trap it as well.I have a large sized cat pan, and a medium sized cat pan, and this works well with both. Cleaning up is very easy, simply pick up the mat, and empty off the litter. I find it easiest to just take it outside and remove the litter as if I were cleaning a rug. Very simple, and mess free!Your cat's might take a day or so to check it out and see what it is, but after that they will get used to it being there and have no issue!I really recommend this to cat parents! This is a home must have!Please note that I was given a discount on this product to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TV5VTNZ053N8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7X2298#wasThisHelpful","R2TV5VTNZ053N8","A2BM0K1XK4O2OX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BM0K1XK4O2OX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ring fits perfectly and seems to be very true to size. It is shaped with nice rounded edges, so it is extremely comfortable to wear. It doesn't feel bulky or anything like that. The ring is nice and shiny, however I noticed that like many rings, it does tend to show finger prints and smudges. These however can easily be buffed and cleaned away with a cleaning cloth.This ring is unisex, and it would look good on either a man or a woman. I myself am a woman, and it looks fine on me. This ring is very nice for it's price point, and is great for those who are either on a budget, or those who may worry about losing or damaging their fine wedding bands and want a alternative for daily wear.It comes nicely boxed, and gives a nice presentation.

"I don't have a baby in my home, so I instead use these for my own personal use. I wear makeup daily, so at night removing it is a must for me. I like to use wash cloths since they tend to be a bit softer, and obviously are the perfect size for my face.These wash cloths from The Motherhood Collection are fantastic. They are soft, but they are also quite durable as well. When I wash my face with these, I can give myself a nice cleansing wash, slight exfoliation, and have my skin left clean. I also like to use these in the afternoon when I get home from work, and don't have time to take a full bath, so I use these to give myself a quick sponge bath. Again, they work perfect. They are absorbent, soft, and feel nice on the skin. They wash and dry easily, no issues there.These work great, and again, these aren't just for babies or children.

"I have been using these types of brushes for about a year now, and I honestly will never use the old paddle style brushes again. I have baby fine, dry, hair. In the mornings my hair can be completely tangled either after waking up, and even after a shower. My hair just likes to be a pain in the rear! I love this brush because it glides through my hair easily, and it gets rid of any tangles without damaging my hair.I use it starting from the ends of my hair and working my way up to the roots. I have used this brush on my hair both when it is wet and dry, and it works perfectly each time.The brush itself is easy to hold when your hands are dry, however if your hands are wet or greasy from hair products you might find that the handle is a bit hard to hold onto.

"When I am cutting my hair, these clips are a must have for me! I can easily keep the sections of my hair up and out of my way. I have baby fine hair, but I have a lot of it, so this can be very challenging with clips. Because my hair is baby fine, it slips through most clips very easily. And because there is so much hair, I need quite a few to keep all my hair where I want it. Every time I have used these, I have never been let down. They grip my hair without damaging it, and every single strand stays clipped in. They are long enough that they can grip onto a good section of my hair as well, so the set of 6 is plenty!I really don't have any negatives to say about these.

I have seen these baking mats that have the guides on them, but I would always forget to pick one up! Luckily I have had the chance to try out this one from The Simple Baker. It is truly a kitchen must have if you like to bake. This has helpful guides on it, which will aid you in creating perfectly baked goodies. Plus it lists different conversions and amounts which really help when you are busy with a recipe. You don't have to stop and research to find out what equals what! It's right there!Being that it is silicone, nothing sticks to it as well. You can also use it in the oven as a standard silicone mat for your baked goodies!

These I didn't have to wrap cellophane around my stomach to keep it in place. These comfortably stick on the skin, stay in place and can be worn under clothing which is nice compared to other wraps.I have also found that with wraps like these, they make me have to go to the bathroom more than normal, so I tend to wear them overnight rather than during the day.These are a good way to get rid of some toxins in the body, however I feel that they are a bit over hyped in ""weight loss"".

"I like to use this as a daily sunscreen under my makeup to help protect me against the suns rays. This is a very light formula, that is a bit thinner than other sunscreens that I'm used to.

It has been quite hot here in New England lately, and this has been protecting my skin against those harsh sun rays.

"One of my favorite childhood memories was going to the local candy shop and buying a Jawbreaker with my Grandpa. When I had the chance to try these, it was a trip down memory lane! I am in my late 20s, so it's probably been a good 10-15 years since I have had this type of treat. I forgot just how long they take to consume!Unlike the Jawbreakers I had as a kid, these come in lollipop form which makes eating them a million times easier. Less mess! I have been enjoying one for the past few days and I am just now about half way done. I am now on the 4th color which is always exciting! I love getting down to see what the next color and flavor is! All of the flavors so far are quite nice, it's not a over powering fruit flavor, but just enough.These are fantastic, and would be great for parties, showers, or just to have around the house!

"Like so many people I get phone calls, or make phone calls when I'm driving. I have a older car that isn't equipped with the high tech technology of the new cars that have cellphone service built right in, so a cellphone holder is my best option. I have a HTC Desire phone, and it is a larger phone, the same size as a iPhone 6 Plus.When this product arrived, the next day I decided to test it out on my way to work. I took off my cellphone cover, and inserted the metal piece that would stay between my phone and the case. I then tested to make sure that the magnetic piece worked with the actual holder before heading out to my car, and all was well. It seemed to have a strong hold, and everything was fine. I put the metal piece in the dead middle of my phone. I got out to my car, and I had the first problem. My air vents are the rolling kind, the whole vent can roll up or down. So I had to roll my vent all the way down so that it would stay. Once I got that all set, I put my phone onto the holder, and everything seemed fine. I started up a call, and backed out of my driveway. When I got to the end of my housing development road, I went to turn and take off, and my cellphone went flying down onto the floor. I pulled over, and picked up my phone, and attempted again. About a minute later, the same thing happened while I was driving straight down the road. Finally after 2 literally dropped calls, I gave up on using this device.The next day I went shopping with a family member who has a iPhone 5C, and I decided to try it out on her phone, in her new car. It worked better with her phone. I think this isn't quite a universal cellphone holder, it seems to do better with regular sized cellphones. If you have a larger one like mine, the iPhone 6 Plus, or any other phone that is similar to that, from my experience, this probably won't work for you.Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7F1GJ6IWSPMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z4FRLHG#wasThisHelpful","R7F1GJ6IWSPMH","A2BM0K1XK4O2OX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BM0K1XK4O2OX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a coffee fan, however I am a fan of only iced coffees. I don't know why, just love the flavor of coffee chilled better than warm. I like to make my own at home because it saves so much money, and I can make it exactly to my liking. First I will say that the day these arrived on my doorstep, I could smell the aroma before even opening the packaging they were in. It has a very nice coffee, nutty, yummy aroma. I immediately ground up some of the beans, and brewed them. I use a standard drip coffee pot for my coffee in case you were wondering.I made up 8 cups of coffee, and let it come to room temperature. Then I put it in a container, and let it set overnight in the fridge. The next day I enjoyed my first cup of iced coffee using this coffee. It tasted absolutely sensational! It has a nice flavor without being too robust. It has a great flavor by itself, but I also added some flavored creamer to it, and that just took it to a whole other level! Brilliant flavor, I am quite a fan!I also let my mother whom is a big coffee fan try this when she came over for a visit. She too enjoyed the coffee very much and wanted to know where she could find this coffee herself! Needless to say this coffee is a big hit in my home!

"This was my first time using a manual coffee grinder. I have used this a dozen times now, and I really like having access to freshly ground coffee at my fingertips. Unlike getting coffee that is already ground, that sits around in a bag until you use it, I can keep whole beans on hand, and grind them up minutes before putting them in my coffee maker. To me this is such a better way to enjoy coffee. A true fresh brew!Using this device is VERY simple. Simply take off the top piece and load your beans in. I fill it to the top, enough so I can place the cover back on. Then I attach the knob, and start turning. This grinder can be set to different grinding preferences, all depending on your personal taste, or the way you will be brewing. I use a standard drip coffee pot, so I like to keep my coffee ground on the finer side. Once you have that set, you are ready to grind. Simply turn the knob. You will know when all the coffee is ground because it will be a lot easier to turn, and you won't hear the grinding sound. After that, simply take off the bottom piece, and there is your fresh coffee!This is such a great tool to have around the house!

"I have a charm bracelet that I have recently been updating, and adding more charms to. I loved the look of this charm, and I added it onto my bracelet. It fit on my bracelet perfectly, not too tight, not too loose. The charm is covered in swarvoski crystals, most of them being white. There are a few random pink and blue crystals mixed in as well. Finally there are 3 larger crystals, 2 that are a pink opal color, and one that is a white opal color (I'm not sure if this pattern is the same with all the charms, or if it is randomly chosen). The crystals are very shiny and add a nice bling to my bracelet. The pops of color on it is nice as well!For the cons, the charm has some beautiful pink and blue crystals on it, however they are awkwardly placed. I would have really liked if the colors were more strategically placed, perhaps with a different pattern. Overall though, it is a very nice, pretty charm!

"With all the credit card hacking and scams lately, I wanted to get something to help protect my cards while I am out, and save me from any mishaps. I didn't use the passport piece in this set because I don't travel internationally, so my review is solely based on the credit card holders.At first when I saw these, I thought for sure it was a rip off. They seem like flimsy paper pouches. But before coming on here and writing that, I wanted to take apart one of the sleeves and really see what it was make of. The outside of the sleeve is just like paper, nothing special. I sacrificed one sleeve and tore it apart. In between the paper layers there is a foil layer, which I imagine is the part that is the RFID blocker. The sleeve itself is pretty sturdy, and holds up fairly well.My cards fit securely in the sleeves nicely, and they easily go right back into my wallet. It does make it a bit more time consuming when getting my cards out, but in the long run its well worth it.

"I love to paint, it is so relaxing for me! I enjoy using acrylic paints because they are so easy to use, plus you can alter them into textures and thickness/thinness that you prefer. Plus if you make a mistake, you can wipe it away with water and start fresh!This kit comes with so many beautiful base colors, so you can use them as is, or mix colors together to get your own special shades. The colors are very well pigmented and vibrant. They stay true to color when they dry as well. Dry time with these paints is fairly quick as well which I like. The paints are of a good constituency, and are easy to work with. I use mine on canvas, and my paintings come out beautifully! I do recommend using a sealer, this will lock in your beautiful work!This paint set would be a great gift for the painter or crafty person in your life. Or perhaps a wonderful gift for yourself!

The comfort grip that are on the hooks, make creating whatever project you are working on so much easier! I am still very much a beginner at crocheting, and I am enjoying trying out each of the hooks, seeing what I can make with them.I love that each hook has its own color, so it is very easy to distinguish which size hook is which.

"This was the first time I have ever used a nail clipper like this before, so I was excited to see how it compared to traditional nail clippers. To my surprise, this nail nipper is so easy to use! I can get into the hard to reach areas of the nails (both toenails and fingernails) and have a clean cut. It provides a nice curved cut shape, and doesn't split my nails.It comes with a protective cover to keep on the tip of the nail nipper when you aren't using as it is quite pointy and sharp. If you are used to using traditional clippers, it may take you a few tries to get the feel for this, but you will easily get the hang of it! I also use it around my cuticle area to trim away any dead skin when doing a manicure.Overall this is a very nifty nipper!

"After my ancient A215's battery died for good, I was able to use it for another year by simply never unplugging it. When I got a new laptop, I gave the old one to my mom, and ordered this battery to avoid the phone calls that would result if it ever came unplugged. It slapped right in, and works just fine.HOWEVER, after completely discharging it and charging it fully, a charge lasts less than an hour and a half on the ""balanced"" power setting. Granted, I paid less than 10 bucks for it, and it's better than having to stay near an outlet, but if you need a 3 hour window before charging, this battery isn't gonna cut it. Still, it's cheap, and better than being tethered to the wall for eternity.

"Dangerous, in that the pieces are cut so that each piece has a needle-sharp point on one end, that is just itching to puncture the roof of a mouth. Also, these are not the sort of pig ears that will last for a long, satisfying chew. They're roasted, and my Corgis love them, but they last about 2 minutes. They're brittle, which is disappointing AND helpful, since I can break off the pointy ends with my fingers.

"I'm always hesitant to buy products that boast of their recycled content, since it usually means that they've already been broken down at least once. It's usually a ploy to assuage consumer guilt, while lowering production costs and allowing a higher price.  These pillows are a prime example of that. When they first arrived, they were firm and pretty and thick. Two months later, they're pancakes. I'm a sound back-sleeper. I rarely move at all. They simply don't hold up. I like a firm pillow, and have searched forever for a pillow that lasts. I'm convinced that no one makes a good pillow anymore.  I called a hotel supply, and asked how often they recommend replacing their top-of-the-line pillows, and was told that most hotels replace them yearly. I understand cleanliness and image considerations, but those pillows aren't even slept on every night. At around 8 bucks each, these pillows aren't even close to that quality, but I also don't like someone taking my money and handing me a product that becomes useless for its intended purpose in less time than it takes for corn to grow.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GL2KQS80SR1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079OBIQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1GL2KQS80SR1N","A3PHFICWOLF7H9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHFICWOLF7H9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is okay, depending on what you're looking for in a how-to book on distilling. For instance, Davis describes the pros and cons of different kinds of stills, but if you want to construct your own, there's NO information in this book on actual still building. There's a lot of theory, and the main point of the book is that you'll need to experiment. The book lists 5 basic recipes for simple mashes (Bourbon, Rye, Irish, peated, and un-peated malts), and then recommends that you play with them.  The cause and effect of varying ingredients is repeatedly emphasized but, again, the majority of the advice is to just rely on trial and error. He DOES give some basic, vague advice on his own preferences, and why he chooses not to use a lot of the methods and components that some choose to use.  On the whole, though, the book offers only a few recipes and a whole lot of encouragement. The idea seems to be that you'll need to figure it out for yourself, which sort of made me wonder why I bought the book. The advice on aging your whiskey, for instance, consists of buying oak barrels and charring them yourself. I'm not sure how feasible that will be for most amateur distillers. Like any book, though, there's useful information to be gleaned, and it should make a nice, brief addition to a distilling library. More of a footnote than a guide. Certainly not a stand-alone book for someone just entering the world of home distilling, but it may float your boat, especially if you're more of an adventurer than a stickler for recipes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WSVLYUIEBBTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480174408#wasThisHelpful","R1WSVLYUIEBBTL","A3PHFICWOLF7H9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHFICWOLF7H9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It hides cords. It hides them well, and doesn't look TOO obvious, especially if painted to match the wall. I have a couple of recommendations, though, if you're thinking of using them.First, ignore the adhesive strip on the back. It will eventually lose its grip on your surface, and you'll have to think of a new way to mount it, especially if it's a longer piece. I'd advise you to just go ahead and use screws. Peel of the backing and stick it up, but just to hold it in place while you drive some small screws through the back. This way, you can avoid eventually having one of those annoying things on your ""to-do"" list that nags at you, but isn't important enough to have to deal with immediately. The plastic is stiff, and doesn't like being bent, so use a small, long screw.Or ignore me and just stick 'em up. I'll say, though, that I own a small motel, and I got tired of walking into rooms and seeing these popped off of the walls. One day, I just went and put screws in them, and now I sleep better.

"Well, apparently there was a description error at some point, judging from the other reviews.  As for the PS2 wireless controller currently offered, though, it's a toss-up. The wireless functionality works perfectly. It takes 3 AAA batteries, and fires right up. No problems there.  The Start, Select, Turbo, & Mode button are crammed together unnecessarily. You could lay a quarter over them, and they'd all be covered. Hitting them on the fly is a crap shoot, but how often do you use them, really?  Here's my biggest gripe: the Turbo button. I use it for an extra boost in Tiger Woods' EA games. At least, I would if it worked. It doesn't. It tries, I guess, but I can press a button repeatedly faster than the Turbo button can build up my swing. Since the Turbo button was the reason that I ordered the controller, I'll be sending it back.

"Simple to install. Twist together the white wires from the fan and light, and use a wire nut to attach them to your homes own white wire. Twist together the black wires from the fan and the light, and do the same.  There are holes in the top of the hood to accommodate screws to mount under your cabinet. It took me about 10 minutes. It's metal, cleans up well, and moves quite a bit of air. Low noise level, especially if it's mounted tight.  You can vent it up through the cabinet, which will require a 10 inch duct, if I remember correctly, and knocking the covered vent hole out of the top of the hood. Conversely, you can leave it as-is, and it'll vent out the front of the unit, with the airflow directed upwards.  With fewer stores carrying these smaller 24 inch range hoods, it's nice to find them at a decent price. It's not the prettiest range hood in the world, but it's also not an overpriced 700 dollar fan.

"I own a small motel, and am constantly updating and remodeling. I recently bought new televisions, and wanted to wall-mount them. I needed something that would provide a theft deterrent, since it's unbelievable what people will steal.These mounts fit the bill.You first mount the bracket onto the back of your television, then attach the other bracket to the wall. All screws are included, even different depths for different televisions. I had a ton of screws left over.The small width of the brackets means that you'll need to hit a stud, at least on the middle holes of the wall bracket. The product photo shows the bracket that attaches to the TV. The wall mount bracket has fewer holes, of course After that, you just slide the TV down into the wall bracket, and it's hung.The feature that makes it useful for me, though, is the fact that there are 4 tabs on the bottom of both brackets that line up and screw together, making it impossible to lift the TV out of the wall mount, unless you remove the 4 screws. A 10 inch screwdriver is long enough to accomplish this. The TV sits pretty close to the wall so, if you don't know the screws are there, it's really hard to tell what's holding the brackets together, especially with everything being black. Of course, if someone wants something badly enough, they'll get it, but these mounts offer a simple, effective solution at a fantastic price. The fact that they mounted in about 10 minutes was just icing on the cake.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCYACVZFAJW19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001SDBVCE#wasThisHelpful","RCYACVZFAJW19","A3PHFICWOLF7H9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHFICWOLF7H9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's the sound of the Salts you remember, and after Nina finishes her first few vocal lines, and those gorgeous harmonies kick in, it's like an old friend that you're really happy to see. They haven't tried to alter their approach or their sound, because they didn't need to. As Joe Strummer said, ""When you find 4 people with that chemistry, you don't mess with it, and we learned that...bitterly."". Maybe Veruca Salt have, too.  Let's hope that everyone involved can get along this go 'round, because the world needs more loud guitars with gorgeous voices, and Veruca Salt do it better than most.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13S9AF96OI91S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8T4WTW#wasThisHelpful","R13S9AF96OI91S","A3PHFICWOLF7H9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHFICWOLF7H9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Gazelle has been in the Adidas lineup forever. Some might call it a ""retro"" shoe, but it's a timeless, no-frills design.Some things to be aware of, if you're new to the Gazelle:  It's suede. You don't want to get it wet too often. It'll darken the color permanently. If you get the black version, it won't matter as much. Some reviewers complain that it's tight and narrow. This is desirable in suede. As the suede stretches from wear, it conforms to your foot, and you end up with a very comfortable shoe. I'm a 9.5, and that's what I wear in these. It takes about 10 days of daily wear for them to start loosening up on my foot.The tongue isn't padded. It's a thin, vinyl tongue, like the tongue on the Adidas Samba. When you first get it, it'll be squeaky, until the laces set themselves into the tongue. This thin tongue allows for a more responsive feel on the foot, but it may be an adjustment if you're used to wearing modern moon-boot shoes. In fact, the entire shoe is quite thin, but it isn't floppy. You can easily squeeze into them while they're laced, without having to dig a finger into them to pull the scrunched-up back of the shoe out.It has a fairly slick sole. You won't be hiking in it. It's not a hard rubber, but it's not a sticky gum rubber, either. It's VERY well bonded to the rubber rand around the bottom. The shoes, in general, are tough, simple, and understated, with the suede providing a bit of casual elegance.I've worn them for so long that I take them for granted. I think of the Gazelle as a utilitarian shoe, until people comment on them. ""Sweet shoes...""Then I think ""Yeah, they really are."".","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WKMAAAIEWTEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N41OZI#wasThisHelpful","R1WKMAAAIEWTEG","A3PHFICWOLF7H9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHFICWOLF7H9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was prepared to dislike these pants, due to the polyester content. It sometimes gives fabric a weird, shiny appearance, and makes them feel gross against the skin.Not these pants, though. They look very nice, and the polyester content gives them a soft hand. You may not even realize that they contain polyester. It's certainly not apparent to the eye. The 1% spandex content gives them just a tiny bit of stretch, more of a flexibility than an actual stretch.The fit is roomy, but not baggy. The thighs are generous, and taper down to a pretty narrow cuff, which I like. Not skinny-jean-narrow, but a trimmer, sleeker look than most khakis. Button closure is sewn on well, and the zipper hasn't stuck or gotten buried up so that it's tough to dig out of the fabric.I got them for 18 bucks and, after wearing them for a couple of months, will be buying more. They're nice looking, very comfy, and fairly tough. I don't know what more I could want in a pant. The low price makes them one of the more pleasant surprises in my online buying career.

"I haven't priced these at any local stores, but they seem worth every bit of the 4.79 I paid for them. The spring steel is sturdy, and just flexible enough for the large-diameter handles I stick in them. At this price, I can have them all over the house. One thing to note, though- if you plan on painting them to match their surroundings, look for some sort of rubberized paint, as the flexibility will cause your paint to crack. I used a brushed nickel spray paint, which isn't too noticeable when the paint does crack. But yeah- keep your broom bristles off of the floor.

"I just ran my 1,000th brad through this nailer- the last of the package. I thought that I'd reserve judgement until I had fired at least that many through it.  A brad nailer is a pretty simple tool, really. It only has one job to accomplish. Shoot brads. And maybe not leak air or blast oil everywhere. My impression, after a couple of weeks of using it on molding, 1/4"" Birch, Pine lumber, & Mahogany, is that this is one of the best purchases I've made.  Granted, I'm not a contractor, and I don't throw my tools on the ground or abuse them, but the only difference that I can detect between this nailer and the more expensive nailers that I've used is the price.I normally don't skimp on tools. I'm not rich enough to buy cheap goods. The reviews here convinced me to take a chance, and I'm completely happy with this tool.  It has performed flawlessly on every material that I've tacked up with it. I WILL say that I've only run 2"" (50mm) brads through it, since they're the longest and, therefore, most likely to not completely sink into the substrate. Out of my first 1,000 brads, I had 4 that didn't fully sink. I can live with that.  I don't know anything about the WEN brand. If they continue making tools that work this well at prices like this, though, I suspect that we may become a lot more familiar with them.

"I own two of these watches. This one, and its brother in a grey finish. I was drawn to them for their thinness, light weight, and minimalism. They're beautiful to me.However, as far as these watches go, beauty is only skin deep. I was fooled be the ""titanium"" description. I thought it was a mesh titanium band and titanium case. It's not. It's an anodized titanium finish. Microscopically thin.I rarely remove my watches. I'll swap them out if they don't match something I'm wearing, and leave it on until that one doesn't match something. You can't do that with these. They will NOT stand up to ANY sort of abuse. That mesh bracelet will catch on the edge of something eventually, and you'll have a tiny, stiff wire poking off of it. Soon, it'll be 5 tiny wires, and the band will look like carpet unraveling, with a divot in the side. It happened to both of mine, and I'm not that hard on my things. The finish will also wear off. They aren't expensive watches, so it's probably worth considering if you want one to wear occasionally.

"The effective pressure of a low-flow shower head is usually achieved by putting an aerator in the path of the water, while making the output holes really small. Sometimes, this makes these heads feel like needles on your skin. Not this one. There's no aerator, so it's a full-on blast, unmitigated by air introduced into the stream. They say that this means less temperature loss, but I don't know how much water can cool between a shower head and my body. The more important thing is that gunk and minerals are less likely to accumulate in the head if it's constantly shooting water out. It's touted as being ""self-cleaning"", and that's the result of this constant stream of water. If you have low water pressure, the 1.5 gallon per minute flow is a good balance between miserly output and deluge. I also have the 2 GPM head, and like it a bit more. Whichever you choose, it will definitely make your shower seem more powerful. On top of that, it's a bargain.

"Some here have said that the fabric is thick. They must have gotten a different shirt. It's sheer to the point of requiring an undershirt. I like the subtle striping, the notched cuff, and that the tail is not too long. I do NOT like how thin it is, or the fact that the collar stays are sewn in. If one of those stays gets bent in the wash, the collar is going to be crooked, and there's nothing to be done about it., aside from cutting them out. I got it for 20 bucks, so I'm not complaining much, but any more than that, and I'd have wished I had gotten a better quality shirt.Update:Less than 3 months later, and I pulled it out of the wash today (its 3rd or 4th washing), and it already has a hole in it, right in the middle of the fabric. Not on a seam or in a high-wear area. A dine-sized hole about 4 inches below the chest pocket. Apparently, the shirt isn't thick enough to withstand washing. Downgraded from 3 stars to 1 star.

"I buy it for backpacking. I didn't have the expiration date problem, but I DID notice that now, in the first week of February, I have until late June to eat 24 boxes of Rice-A-Roni before it expires. I'm sure I can handle it. One issue that concerns me, though, after poring over the ingredient list, is the use of the already mentioned disodium inosinate. The package doesn't tell the source of this salt, and much of it used in food is sourced from genetically modified organisms. I'm not paranoid about genetically modified salts as much as I despise companies just putting stuff in my food without telling me and letting me decide if I want to buy it. Genetically modified corn is a different story for another discussion. I love the taste of beef Rice-A-Roni, and I doubt that I'll throw any of it away. All the same, until I can find an answer about the makeup of the product, I probably won't buy any more, which saddens me. I've been eating it since I was a kid. I hope it doesn't turn out to be The San Francisco Genetically Modified Food Alternative Treat. If anyone already has the answer, please let me know.Update: I received this from Rice-A-Roni when I asked if any of their ingredients were genetically modified...""We appreciate the opportunity to respond to your concerns about Rice-A-Roni. Disodium Inosinate is sourced from dried seaweed or dried fish. It can also be isolated from mushrooms."" I was hoping for more of a ""Yes"" or ""No"".

"The Mansur is part of Tsubos Spring/Summer 2012 line. The only shoe I liked from the collection, too. It also comes in a leather version, which doesn't look as good, if you ask me. Upon first seeing the Mansur, I thought ""Those laces are going to saw right through that suede in no time."". Well, after ordering them anyway, here's why it won't: notice there's no tongue. It's basically a stiff, supportive sock with a suede shell wrapped around it. The laces aren't even needed, if you get the right size. They don't need to be tight. There's a plastic shank under the polyurethane footbed to help the shoe hold its shape, a removable sock liner, and an anti-bacterial lining. The packaging says that there are perforations to help air circulation, but my feet still get warm in them. I'm a 9.5, and it's snug out of the box, but a good snug, like a water shoe. Sometimes, Tsubos have a stupid-looking giant toe box. These are quite low-profile. I love the fit. Looking at the pictures, I was also hesitant about there being suede wrapped on the bottom of the shoe. It's solidly stitched to the sole, but I'm hard on shoes, and I'm pretty sure that this will be the first part of the shoe to go on my pair. If you're a city dweller who spends most of his time on sidewalks, though, it should last a good long while, especially if they're kept dry. I had them on my wish list at 65 bucks for a month, debating whether to buy them, and then the price dropped to 47 bucks, so I grabbed them.

"Here's a little gem in the Clutch catalog, and one well worth hearing, even if it isn't as mind-blowingly, consistently good as most of their other records. The title tells you all you need to know- this is the sound of a band having fun, and many of the songs are anomalies in the Clutch canon. Gnome Enthusiast, for instance, sounds nothing like anything ever recorded by the band, with its 70s beat and warbly leads framing a falsetto vocal that's completely uncharacteristic. In fact, the whole album owes a lot to the 70s, but not in a Monster Magnet, metal way. It's more of a loose, soupy Allmann Brothers vibe, but you can still smell the smoke coming off of it. It offers the first glimpses of the straight blues sound they would experiment with later down the road. There's Jean-Pauls only studio drum solo, too. It's brief but effective, There's a blues boogie instrumental, a couple of spoken word comedy intros, the original version of One Eye Dollar, and my own favorite- the full-moon, wind-through-the-trees, eerie menace of Basket of Eggs. I Send Pictures rocks all over the place with only 3 notes, but The Drifter tests my patience with its repetition. Neil has a lot of fun with his wordplay here, and it seems like everyone is having a good time. The production sounds very organic and warm, like it was actually recorded in their Jam Room on an ancient TEAC or something, and it suits the vibe of the songs well. While it's not as aggressive in the riff department as most Clutch albums, it's still an interesting listen from a band that seems incapable of making a poor record.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A62UB1EUUMBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002JP29S#wasThisHelpful","R3A62UB1EUUMBT","A3PHFICWOLF7H9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHFICWOLF7H9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mark Twight wants you to know how hardcore he is. And how punk he is. The thing is, though, that he comes across as more of a goth kid who's mad at the world because his parents don't understand him. Having something to prove doesn't make for compelling reading, and there is almost nothing in these essays that describe the actual climbing.The prose is atrocious. Provoking reactions seems to be the only motivation. Chapters begin with Nietzsche quotes, which is funny. If you're an Existentialist who believes that we're totally alone in the universe, maybe you shouldn't adhere to someone elses philosophy. There are ruminations on loss- mostly to illustrate what a dangerous life he leads. There are admissions of weakness- mostly to try and convince the reader that his ego isn't totally in control. Which, of course, proves that it is. False humility is bad acting. He rails against people who lead commonplace lives, while sleeping in their spare bedrooms and back offices. He whines a lot, which seems at odds with his seemingly total devotion to the idea that the world doesn't owe anyone anything. In short, I found nothing compelling about reading Kiss or Kill. Do you have an angry teenager at home? Sneak into their room and read their diary. There- I just saved you ten bucks.His ideas about European style alpine climbing, and his proof of its superiority are the sole redeeming qualities of the book. Unfortunately, they consist of about 10 pages. I may sound like a curmudgeon, and this is the only time I've ever given a single star review, but I was shocked at how disappointing this book was. With his list of accomplishments, Twight could have come up with a much better collection of writings. Instead, he seems more interested in promoting his reputation, and then complaining about it. Others have enjoyed the book, so I'm in the minority, I guess.

"Here's where the Misfits said goodbye to kitschy sci-fi and horror B-movie odes and entered the realm of real-world physical and spiritual violence. For some, it's the least satisfying Misfits release. Taken on its own terms, though, it's where the Misfits HAD to end up if they didn't want to become a cartoon caricature. It also increases the tempos by about a bazillion percent, and songs speed by in a blur of blinding rage. 12 songs in 21 minutes. Some may miss the doo-wop catchiness and singalong choruses of previous Misfits, but Earth A.D. is brilliant in a different way. It forces you back in your seat instead of making you want to jump out of it. Glenns voice is in fine form, and punctuated with a lot more syncopation in the rhythms on this batch of songs. Indeed, the drumming is intense. The lyrics have grown much darker, and a few of the songs were actually intended to be Samhain songs before being added here to flesh out the album.

"These are very thin, so follow others' lead and use Liquid Nails to install them. If you don't, you run the risk of denting in the centers of the tile eventually. As I said, they're thin, but they're deep enough to dent. They're completely uniform in size, so everything lines up perfectly with a little patience. The results look spectacular. I did a 2'x6' area behind my range, and then wrapped it around to form a backsplash. I purchased a grey caulk from Lowes that's sold to go with their laminate countertops, and it's a great match for the brushed aluminum tiles. If the different textures in the pics throw you off, realize that, in the brushed aluminum finish, the photos are showing them installed with one tile with the ""grain"" running up and down, and the next tile running side to side. The effect is awesome. I tried both the triangular and square looks, and opted for the simplicity (and fewer cuts) of the square pattern. They cut very easily with scissors, yet don't warp when handled. A great project for someone who may be a little nervous about doing it themselves, as they can be stuck on with the 2 sided tape before they're actually glued- thus allowing for accurate alignment.

"...and it's a big IF- you don't think you'll ever want to fire up a stove in your vestibule. For the size, the Morrison 2 is quite light, which was its initial attraction, as I backpack with a lazy Corgi who refuses to carry anything. As others have said, it's awesome for those 6 feet or over, which is something that a lot of 2 person tents can't say. If you're more than 3 feet wide, though, you may be squeezed a bit. Others have also expressed dissatisfaction with rain entering the vent below the door. Mountainsmith have remedied this. Newer models don't have the vent. It DOES, however have 2 ingenious top vents that are held open by a rigid piece that's sewn onto the tent fly and flips into place to hold the vent open. They can also be left closed. See the mesh on the upper half of the door? There's fabric that can be zipped up to cover the mesh, which would leave just the ends of the tent with mesh exposed. Kind of odd for a mesh-walled tent, but okay. Two doors, too- no more crawling over the bigger bladder or late sleeper. There's no problem getting in or out. The fly provides good coverage all the way to the ground, and enough stakes are included to guy out every point on the tent. 10 in all. The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star tent (for the price) are the vestibules. You will NOT fit a pack in them without it contacting the fly, thus sucking in moisture. A pair of boots is about as much as I'll put in them. If you use a liquid fuel stove that produces a taller flame upon its initial light instead of a low propane flame, you'll be lighting it outside of the vestibule. Whether you try to bring it under the vestibule after it's lit depends on how brave you are, and your confidence in nylon not being able to melt. It's the only flaw with the design, but it's a big one. Unless you use a JetBoil, I guess. The clips are beefy and attach securely, without being a pain to snap off like some Mountain Hardwear clips can be.There are plenty of mesh pockets inside, and the gear loft is even included, although it hangs too low for me to sit up when it's in place. I leave it at home to save a couple of ounces. All in all, it's an amazing tent for the price. I just with they'd make at least one of the vestibules a little (lot) more useful. Recommended for anyone looking for a lightweight tent that's also easy on the wallet. Just plan on bringing everything inside. Even the Corgi.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EACF92VU5ABB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00452C2IC#wasThisHelpful","R2EACF92VU5ABB","A3PHFICWOLF7H9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHFICWOLF7H9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used the Wahl Peanut for 20 years. I've bought other corded trimmers, and nothing comes close to the power of the Peanut. Contrary to what others have said, the Peanut is easily capable of doing an entire haircut. In fact, the idea that it can cut hair well on part of the head, but not on another part is just silly. The Peanut has the benefit of a power cord. No matter what anyone tells you, a cordless trimmer will never be a good substitute for a corded one. The motors just aren't designed for the power of AC current and, as the blades dull, more power will be necessary to push the blade through the hair. A battery won't provide this power and will, in fact, decrease the available power as the batteries age. With the Peanut, you just pop on a new blade for 15 bucks or so. Voila- new clipper. The power cord is about 8 feet long, too. So no loss of mobility if you need to run around the room while trimming your beard or leg hair. The Oster T-finisher is close, but not as good. It's also more expensive, and can't be used with guards for hair cutting like the Peanut can. It'll shave a beard down to barely visible stubble, with no pulling or grabbing. I suppose that it's technically a ""Trimmer"", due to its small size, but it's easily the equal of most clippers in all but width. If you want to cut your own hair at home, buy the Peanut and a set of combs/guards. If you have short hair (less than 1/2""), that's about all you need. Try them. You'll be glad you did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HISUV8DI3RZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0008JF0EY#wasThisHelpful","R1HISUV8DI3RZ2","A3PHFICWOLF7H9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHFICWOLF7H9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book with a fascinating premise- build your own cabin! It does a fantastic job of explaining the benefits and shortcomings of different roofing, foundations, and wall fabrication options, and then explains how to build them. The drawings are clear and the text very well-written for the DIY layperson. It covers clearing land, the best options for your lands foundation needs, how to frame the walls and then slap a roof on the thing. It even tells how to hand-cut logs for your walls. Here's the only (arguable) drawback. It does NOT go into what to do if you want electricity or plumbing, except for a brief few pages on how to collect rainwater or install a pump from a well, pond, or stream. While this good and useful information, I'd like to have seen a page or two on plumbing and wiring considerations that might befit a more modern application. Of course, there are other books in this same series that will help with those, so it may not be an issue for you. As it's written, it provides all of the info you need to build a rock-solid, albeit primitive, array of buildings.

"I'm a big fan of Charmin Ultra. I can do without a lot of superfluous niceties, but toilet paper is one product where I don't mind paying a higher price for a better product. This isn't it. My local grocery was out of the Ultra, so I chose this in the name of research. Oops. It's single-ply, with very little texture and no softness or absorbency at all, compared to my usual. When I spun it off the roll, I immediately thought ""commercial toilet paper!"". Seriously, this is just like the stuff you'd find in the restroom at a campground. Charmin Ultra is like sitting on a cloud. This Charmin is like sitting in the rain. It'll do the job, but so will leaves, right? Leaves are probably more absorbent than this, too. It's the only toilet paper I've ever had in my home that seemed like it would never run out, no matter how much I wanted it to.

"The Dunlop Fin is like getting a 12 string guitar for the price of a pick. The scalloped edge, when strummed across a chord, produces a chiming, shimmery effect that adds a lot of depth and sparkle to the chord. Sounds gimmicky, right? It's not. I don't know how it works, but it does. It also makes for pretty effortless pick scrapes, if you're into those. They also hold their shape better than most picks, but then I only use the green and purple ones, which are quite thick. The sharper, horn-like point also makes tremolo picking a lot easier. Lastly, you have a standard, rounded blunt pick end for your normal playing. The somewhat textured surface makes them stick to your fingers better than a plastic pick, especially when sweaty. It also makes it easier to rotate the pick in your hand to access the various edges of the pick. All in all, I don't know why anyone would use a regular triangular pick when these are larger, sturdier, and provide such interesting tones when you want them to. Try them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4HHVTMO9XSG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AVM5LS#wasThisHelpful","R4HHVTMO9XSG2","A3PHFICWOLF7H9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHFICWOLF7H9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perry Ellis makes clothes for real guys, not runway models. This jacket is a lightweight herringbone linen. It's fully lined with 2 flap pockets, 3 interior pockets, and a center vent. The backs of the lapels are unlined, but the collar has a felt backing. It's thin enough for warm weather occasions that require a jacket, and thick enough to have a substantial feel. Working cuff buttons, too. Size runs true. Sleeves weren't too long, as most sleeves are for me, and I have longer arms.

"No modifications needed. Slipped right in the hole on my '99, using the arm from my broken handle. Screws are NOT included, so a couple of those and some locking nuts, and I had a new handle in about 10 minutes. The springs are beefier than the stock springs, so I anticipate a long life for this new handle. Which is more than I can say for the original part. For the price, this is an inexpensive and simple fix for the malfunctioning handles that all Explorer owners eventually encounter.Update- 1/17/13 It broke. Not even on the arm that holds the spring. It broke where the plastic meets the handle itself. The seller, AutoHalo, informed me that the 1 year warranty didn't apply because it was broken ""during use"", and refused the return.Another update- 6/18/13I ordered another one, in case my first experience was a fluke.

"These are very thin, so follow others' lead and use Liquid Nails to install them. If you don't, you run the risk of denting in the centers of the tile eventually. As I said, they're thin, but they're deep enough to dent. They're completely uniform in size, so everything lines up perfectly with a little patience. The results look spectacular. I did a 2'x6' area behind my range, and then wrapped it around to form a backsplash. I purchased a grey caulk from Lowes that's sold to go with their laminate countertops, and it's a great match for the brushed aluminum tiles. If the different textures in the pics throw you off, realize that, in the brushed aluminum finish, the photos are showing them installed with one tile with the ""grain"" running up and down, and the next tile running side to side. The effect is awesome. I tried both the triangular and square looks, and opted for the simplicity (and fewer cuts) of the square pattern. They cut very easily with scissors, yet don't warp when handled. A great project for someone who may be a little nervous about doing it themselves, as they can be stuck on with the 2 sided tape before they're actually glued- thus allowing for accurate alignment.

"First of all- it's a micro-amp in a plastic housing, with plastic knobs and a plastic strap, even though the product description says it's leather. It's around 5 inches tall. On/volume, tone, and overdrive knobs. No reverb circuit. Sounds pretty basic, huh? It is. It's also capable of a LOT of different sounds, and good ones, at that. And it's LOUD. Much louder than expected for an amp with tiny wattage. Instructions are minimal, which is fine, since the controls are self-explanatory. The best part about them is that they show 15 control settings for different tones, from 60s British to fuzz to 70s hard rock. It captures them pretty convincingly, too! At higher volumes, the plastic cabinet starts to sound a little thin and twangy, but it's loud enough that it's not necessary to push it hard enough to enter that territory. I played mine outside, and had a buddy walk down the road. He could hear it a little less than a quarter mile away. Impressive. On mine, the belt clip needed to be removed and squished together to make it able to clip onto thinner materials. Out of the box, it could be clipped onto something 1/2 inch thick. It's sturdy, though. In fact, the whole unit feels pretty sturdy, with the possible exception of the knobs. But they aren't wobbly, and that could just be own reluctance to trust plastic knobs. But then, most amps have plastic knobs. I ordered a 9 volt power supply with mine, and I'm glad that I did. This little monster puts out enough power that I doubt that a battery would last long in it. Given the choice between the sounds of the Marshall, Fender, and this little beast, The Danelectro is the hands-down winner. At less than 20 bucks, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K4BHY4PA5QFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027M30Z6#wasThisHelpful","R3K4BHY4PA5QFI","A3PHFICWOLF7H9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHFICWOLF7H9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use sprayers for my garden. It's about 80' x 40'. I spray for cutworms and bugs, and sometimes fertilizer or food. I spray about 5 or 6 times a season. In the past, I've sometimes had to buy 2 sprayers a year, due to broken handles, leaking seals, or faulty nozzles. I think those days are over. This is a VERY substantial sprayer. The nozzle is solid brass, the handles moving parts are metal and solidly assembled, and the screw-on lid is quite beefy. I've only had it around half to 2/3 full, and found that around 40 pumps allows me to spray my entire garden without having to re-pump. That alone makes it a joy to use. It has a pressure relief valve, too, which illustrates how effectively the tank holds the air. It's needed. I don't know exactly how much the output is, but it's quite a bit. To saturate a 5 foot tall tomato plant, I only have to stand in front of it for about 10 seconds. That's a lot of spray. And the angled nozzle makes it easy to spray the undersides of leaves, too.

The decorative fronts that came with these weren't particularly attractive either, but given the ability to choose my own designs, I probably could have found something a little more to my liking.The frames I received had an outside edge of approximately 12""x12"". Since I really didn't care for the decorative fronts I received, I decided to do a little experimenting. I have quite a stash of 12x12 sheets of scrapbook paper, and some 12x12 stretched artists canvases, so I thought ""Why not?"". I found a scrapbook sheet (heavier stock) in a design that matched my room, attached it to the canvas with double-sided mounting tape, then pressed the canvas into the frame. It fit perfectly and feels snug and secure, and voila, I now have a made-to-order picture (See my photo of the black and white fleur-de-lis print) that will  easily remove from the wall when I am ready for it to do so.So, A+ for ease of installation, B- for the cheap quality, and D for the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SFV3GC2BQHQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9Q7MOM#wasThisHelpful","R3SFV3GC2BQHQ8","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for a way to get individual loads of laundry from the large bathroom hamper to the laundry room. What I didn't want was a bulky plastic hamper that takes up a lot of room and is not easily stored. This hamper is perfect for what I want it to do. It holds a substantial amount of laundry but easily folds up for convenient storage. The canvas from which it is made feels very sturdy, as do the web carrying handles. This bag would also make a great beach bag, perfect for carrying towels and beach toys.

"I have been using the Hoover TwinTank steam mop for about two years now, and I really like it. So, i was interested in comparing this mop with my current one.There are a couple of striking differences between the two mops:  1) The SteamFast provides a continual blast of steam, while the TwinTank has a lever that releases steam only when you press on it.  2) The Steamfast has just one tank for clear water, where (as the name implies) the TwinTank has two tanks: one tank holds clear water, and the other holds a cleaning solution for hard-to-clean areas.I have mixed feelings about the constant steam approach of this mop. I like the idea of not having to repeatedly push a lever for a blast of steam. But, sometimes I want to back off of the amount of steam/moisture being applied to a certain area of the floor, and that isn't possible with this mop. I don't see it as a big problem, but it may be an issue at some point.Second, I like the ability to add a cleaning solution to the tank of the Hoover model (to use only as needed). Obviously, with just one tank, that isn't possible with this mop. You could, however, get around that problem by putting some cleaning solution (like the kind made for the Hoover model) into a spray bottle, and spraying it onto particularly dirty areas before you use the steam mop. Actually, you could use what I already use in a spray bottle for quick touch ups, and that is the Swiffer Wet Jet cleaning solution.This mop is very straightforward: It steams the floor. It isn't fancy, but it feels like a well made product, and it does glide very smoothly across the floor. And assembly was easy, taking only about 90 seconds.If your steam cleaning needs are basic, then I believe this is a really nice choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDXJ3W4HGUWMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVBURBC#wasThisHelpful","RDXJ3W4HGUWMF","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am experiencing my music in a whole new way with these headphones. I have had others, and some fairly expensive, but these are the best I have owned. Granted, I have never owned the Bose headphones that everyone raves about, but at this price point (compared to Bose), I am very happy indeed.The fit is very comfortable, and when I have these on, the music is crystal clear and I hear NOTHING else but the music; even when my husband is watching football on TV with the volume turned up to a significant level. And when I am listening, I hear things in the music that I never noticed before: the bass lines are clearer, background vocals more defined, and the stereo quality exceeds my expectations.This product also comes with a nice carrying case, perfect for travel.I would recommend these to someone who is looking for a great set of headphones at a manageable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KFPLM2IW45Q2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND880H6#wasThisHelpful","R3KFPLM2IW45Q2","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am pretty  disappointed with these glasses. While great in theory, the reality just doesn't live up to the hype.After washing the glasses I put them in the freezer and left them for about 5 hours. When I removed them, the liquid had frozen and the glass was very cold. That was good. But it was, sadly, about the only thing that was good...Here are the problems as I experienced them:1) In spite of the claim that the silicone sleeve acts as a coaster and prevents condensation, that was not at all my experience. I sat the glasses on the counter top, added whiskey, and within less than thirty seconds condensation began to form on the bottom of the silicone sleeve. When I picked the glass up to take a sip, large droplets of water dripped off of the bottom and had to be wiped away with a napkin. The formation of condensation persisted for the first five minutes or so until the glass began to warm up a bit.2) The silicone sleeve does not protect your hand from the cold of the glass as advertised. Initially, the glass was uncomfortable to hold, even more so than a regular whiskey glass that has been chilled in the freezer.3) The whiskey did not get, nor did it remain, any colder than whiskey served in a standard whiskey glass. It took about fifteen seconds of swirling the whiskey around inside the glass to cool it down, and it had warmed back up to being cool (rather than cold) within about twenty minutes.If you like really cold whiskey that is not quickly diluted by ice, I would skip these glasses an opt for the large spherical ice balls that can be made at home in silicone molds. They cool the whiskey down very quickly, and due to the surface area of the spherical cube, it takes it a long time to melt, so the whiskey is only marginally diluted. I bought some about a year ago and love them.

"I run a small craft business from home, and am always looking for nice scissors with blades that stay sharp and a grip that is comfortable to use for extended periods of time. These scissors fit the bill. I love the way they feel in my hand - very well balanced and the grip is very comfortable. The inside of the handle grip is fashioned from a soft rubber and there is another spot of the same ""grippy"" rubber on the bottom side of the handle grip, perfect for resting your index finger on while cutting.The blades are thick (in a good way) and are made of titanium, which keeps them lightweight while remaining durable. The only thing I would have changed about these scissors is that I would have made them a bit finer (more pointed) at the tip. For whatever reason, the tips of the blades are squared off at the end, which makes it a little more challenging to get a sharp, precise cut into corners.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MA164EINYCIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBKVMJI#wasThisHelpful","R1MA164EINYCIE","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am no athlete, but am middle-aged, and therefore, need to pay closer attention to my level of fitness and strength in order to stay healthy in my ""silver"" years. So, I really like the idea of resistance bands: no trips to the gym (costly and inconvenient) and no condescending looks from the young, super-fit crowd.I found these bands to be well made and relatively easy to use. The set comes with handle grips that make it much easier to grasp the end of the bands and attaching them is easy. Simply slip the loop on the end of the grip through the loop on the end of the band, then slip the handle back through the loop, and the handle is securely attached. The set also comes with an attachment that allows you to attach the band to a door, but my doors fit so tightly that I couldn't get the nylon attachment between the door and the frame, so I am not able to use that option.I was a bit disappointed that the set didn't come with printed exercises. I was able to go online and find lots of resistance band workout exercises, many on YouTube. But printed material would have been nice. Not everyone has access to the internet and a printer.My biggest problem with these bands is that I am short, and some of the workouts provide no resistance at all, since the bands are so long. For example, if I stand in the middle of the band and try to pull the bands up into a bicep curl, the band stays fairly loose. When I pull up on the handles, they reach almost to my ears before they tighten up. So, that's a problem, but not a problem most people will have to deal with.Overall, they are nice and I can see myself using them for certain types of exercises going forward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REZ8NENIASTL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EW0V2EW#wasThisHelpful","REZ8NENIASTL4","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an exceptionally thick mattress, and finding a mattress pad that truly fits has been challenging. Many of the products say they have deep pockets, but they still aren't deep enough to fit my mattress (a standard thickness innerspring mattress with a 6 inch memory foam topper). I bought a waterproof mattress pad at a local discount store, but the second time I washed it, it literally fell to pieces.This is a much nicer pad. It truly does have deep pockets. It slipped over my mattress and topper with room to spare, yet stays tucked in nicely without slipping. And, in spite of being waterproof, it feels soft and silky, not like plastic or vinyl. It has a bit of cushioning on top. The description of this pad says it is ""plush"" but I think that's a bit of an exaggeration. It's is just about 1/4 of an inch of soft, quilted fabric. Nice enough, though.By biggest complaint with this pad is that it is really difficult to launder. I washed it straight out of the bag to get rid of the smell of plastic and dye. Due to it's size, it took up the entire tub of my extra-large capacity washer, and it was really difficult to spin the water out of it at the end of the wash cycle. In fact, I never did get it completely spun out, and had to put it into the dryer while it was still very wet. So, then it took 80 minutes to dry. That's a lot of electricity to be used on one item.Overall, this is a nice pad, but I am already dreading the next time it has to be laundered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSR3EQA1PUR1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWTK87M#wasThisHelpful","RSR3EQA1PUR1J","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay - this does print nice pictures; however, canât say I enjoyed the process.I attempted to connect the printer to my computer using the âwirelessâ feature to no avail.  I then turned the process over to my tech savvy teenage students, who gave it a valiant try, but still to no avail. So, going ""old school"",  I hard wired the printer to my laptop and attempted to load up the paper. Sadly, the control panel and the output tray did everything they could to prevent this from happening (what a ridiculous design concept this has in the tray/display panel) but after lifting the front of the printer up with one hand, and reaching under the output tray with the other, I managed to slide an entire assortment of tray/cd holders out.  So, balancing the printer like a waiter with a tray full of wine glasses, I was eventually able to put the paper in and hit print. The printer informed me that I still needed to load paper... Frustrating. So, I lifted and balanced and reloaded time and time again and, eventually, was able to get this finicky machine to recognize that I had indeed put some paper into the tray. Success!! And it only took 15 minutes!! (Should have taken thirty seconds.)Next, I loaded a 4X6 sheet of photo paper and that precipitated a whole additional go-around of ""load paper"" messages, paper jams, and swearing. Eventually, I did get a really nice color photo of my dog. Great quality photo, horrible experience.So here's the scoop: Printing, faxing, copying, scanning...this machine does it all. Sort of. If you have patience. And Valium.The printer is very cool and has an impressive robotic movement of trays and a nice colorful display on the front panel, but itâs hard to use (in my experience), especially the loading of the paper.  But if you are an acrobat or a yoga master, you might pull it off without having to get your head upside down or sit in the floor under your desk to do so.I don't have the patience for fiddling with this printer, and have now tucked it neatly into the closet of my office.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4JCE3WJWD9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV97KYS#wasThisHelpful","RA4JCE3WJWD9J","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted this product to work. The idea of alleviating hot flashes without the use of hormone therapy is very appealing. Unfortunately, this product gave me a significant and unrelenting headache. Within twenty fours hours of taking the first dose, my head began to hurt.

I finally decided to discontinue the product, just as a test. My headache was gone within a day. So, just to be fair, I waited a few days and then began taking the product again.

"I haven't used a Corel product since the early '90s, back in the days when CorelDraw was king, so I was really interested in trying out this photo editing software. I have been a user of GIMP, for the past couple of years, to edit photos for business  publications, and I really like it (more than PhotoShop), but it has a REALLY steep learning curve which I still haven't fully mastered. That's where a program like Corel PaintShop may be a better choice for the casual user.I won't go into all the features here, since if you are already pretty handy with editing software, you can read the product description yourself, and if you aren't real experienced, technical explanations won't mean much. Let it suffice to say that you can do an awful lot of cool things with this program without feeling overwhelmed.You can erase the background of your photos fairly easily, which is my favorite feature in any photo editing software. So, let's say you snapped a fantastic shot of your daughter, but she's standing in front of the trash cans at the end of your driveway. Not so attractive. Well, with this software you can eliminate everything but her and add the background of your choice. I did this with a picture of my daughter holding her dog, and now they are enjoying their time together in a ""sunny meadow"" rather than down in my basement, where the picture was taken. Nice.If you are a scrapbooker, this is nifty software because it allows you to easily add colorful text and other special effects to your photos. You can also do creative ""artsy"" things with it like changing the colors in the picture to give it a fun, funky feel (think Andy Warhol-ish primary colors). There are ""quick tip"" style bullet points in a box on the right hand side of your screen that help guide you through some of the functions as you are using them, which is nice, and there are online tutorials if you need more help or need to see a demonstration of the procedure.There are far too many features too cover here, but just know there are lots. The only reason I don't give this program five stars is because I still believe that truly learning the ins and outs of its use requires more time and dedication than your average user may want to spend, but if you are willing to devote some time to the program, you can turn out some great photos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VB8GIQUD4FL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LYYN13O#wasThisHelpful","R2VB8GIQUD4FL9","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am all for doing things that are good for the environment and our well-being, and Seventh Generation presents itself as being a manufacturer that incorporates both of these philosophies into their products. And they do - sort of.Throughout Seventh Generation's website, product literature and labeling, they refer to themselves as ""green"" and the makers of ""plant based"" cleaning products. I won't dispute that, but I encourage you to read the label on the back of this product. Water, as in most products, is the first listed ingredient, but the second ingredient is sodium coco sulfate which they say it is a plant based cleaner. And so it is - but so is sodium laurel sulfate, the much maligned cleaning ingredient in many household products. In fact, sodium coco sulfate is actually a blend of sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium caprylic sulfate, sodium capric sulfate, sodium oleic sulfate, and sodium stearyl sulfate. Run an internet search on sodium coco sulfate if you want to know more... Don't get me wrong, I am no chemist and don't claim to be, but I thought that was interesting. Apparently, ""natural"" is in the eye of the beholder.All of that said, this hand soap is o.k. It's a bit thin in consistency compared to many other hand soaps, and I feel like I am using more per pump than I am with other soaps, so there may not be much cost advantage here. It has a pleasant, citrusy scent that works great in the kitchen since it helps tone down the smell of fish, garlic, onions or other smelly stuff on your hands.I probably won't buy this again since I really don't see a lot of advantage to this over some other soap options and I think its cost- per-pump is higher. I am also not one who is afraid of anti-bacterial agents (like Triclosan) in my kitchen soap since I feel like the kitchen is one place that I really don't want to be spreading germs around. But, if you are concerned about the ingredients in the antibacterial soaps or really like the idea of trying to be ""greener"", this may be worth your $4.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I3AJN61MSMSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LR2173O#wasThisHelpful","R3I3AJN61MSMSQ","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using multimedia projectors in the classroom and for business presentations for many years now, and have always been a bit disappointed with what I had to work with. Getting everything hooked up, getting the picture squared up and at the appropriate size, and then getting the room dark enough that people could actually see what was being projected was, frankly, a pain in the neck. I feel that those issues have been nicely addressed in this projector. Getting everything hooked up is pretty easy, and the projector comes with the cables necessary for using it straight out of the box.The color brightness on this is a real improvement over what I have used in the past. I actually ran a side-by-side test with my older multimedia projector and the difference is pretty impressive. The images from the older machine were very ""faded"" looking, with not much color contrast, and the room had to be pretty dark to see the image clearly. Not so with the 7230. The colors are bright and the images are crisp, even in standard lighting. While I still prefer to dim the lights while presenting, I could present in a normally lit room and participants would still be able to clearly see what was being projected.This machine also has a feature that my older projector doesn't have, which is a sliding lens cover that allows you to blank out the screen when you are in between videos or slides, which is handy, but one caveat: you have to be careful not to accidentally hit the focus arm when you are attempting to slide the cover over...they are really close together and you can knock the focus out of whack with just a little bump.My favorite feature on the 7230 is that it lets you adjust the picture to level/square its position, even if the projector is sitting at an odd angle to the screen. As anyone who has used a multimedia projector more than once knows, it isn't always possible to get the projector on a perfectly level service and squarely in front of what you are projecting onto. While most projectors have some mechanism for compensating for that problem, the 7230 has addressed it more efficiently than any other projector I have tried. Other manufacturers could learn something here.Overall, this is a great little projector. It is quiet, lightweight, and versatile (runs HDMI, MHL, USB A and B, and S-Video). But you will pay handsomely for the technology. If you don't need all the varying input modes and high level of projection brightness, there may be less expensive options out there that will work for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E82ZIXEWZNAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8XKAA2#wasThisHelpful","R2E82ZIXEWZNAS","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have spent the better part of my adult life looking for the ""perfect"" vacuum cleaner. This isn't it. But, it's a nice little vacuum nonetheless.I have always had dogs that live inside and like most dogs (and some cats) they shed. Actually, mine shed a LOT. So, keeping dog hair off of the furniture, my clothes, and my even sandwich is a problem. I need something that has a significant amount of suction in order to get those stubborn dog hairs out of the weave of the carpet and upholstery. This vacuum has that in spades, It has an extraordinary amount of suction (it can suck the throw rugs right up off of the floor), but that can be controlled by a dial on the canister. It also has a little ""valve"" on the chrome wand that you can open with your thumb to also minimize suction without having to bend over. That's a cool feature that I haven't seen on other vacs before. Another point in its favor is that it is fairly quiet. I have had vacuums that you needed to wear ear plugs to use, so the relatively low noise from this machine is nice. And emptying the canister once you have finished vacuuming is a snap (literally). You just snap off the dirt receptacle and shake the contents into the trash bin. It has a strange little attachment for dusting and getting into crevices, an all-in-one sort of thing that didn't impress me much, but I did use it on the upholstery with satisfactory results.My biggest complaint about this vac is that the actual vacuuming head does not have a rotating brush, and on certain carpets it is almost impossible to push it across the floor, even with the suction regulation reducing the amount of drag. It worked pretty well on my Berber carpet, great on my hard floors, but my deep pile area rug was a challenge to vacuum; an ""eat-your-Wheaties-before-you try-it"" kind of thing. I also found that the automatic cord-rewinder required a little coaxing, I kind of had to jiggle the cord a little bit and push it toward the machine to get it to rewind fully.All in all, if you are going to use this for quick cleanups on carpet, or heavier jobs on hard floors, I think you will be fine with this machine (that's what I will be using it for), but if you plan on vacuuming your whole house with it, or have deep pile on your carpets, I would probably look for something that has a rotating brush on the vacuum head.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERQWHE2V1O4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4MHJH8#wasThisHelpful","R3ERQWHE2V1O4A","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This coffee maker is just about what I expected at its price point. It does the job, the frills are few, and the price for a programmable coffee pot (at less than $30) is a decent one. My daily ""go-to"" home coffee pot is a programmable Mr. Coffee with a stainless steel carafe, for which I paid about $80 a couple of years ago. This pot is not in that league, but it gets the job done.Be advised that the majority of the ""stainless"" on this appears to actually be plastic that has been painted to look like stainless steel. I'm okay with that in this price range. Is it sturdy? Nope. It has a lot of plastic in it which speaks for itself. But, the ability to have a nice cup of coffee waiting on me when I arrive in the office in the morning (which is where this coffee pot has taken up residence) is a nice thing. Getting it programmed is a pain in the neck, but I don't find that to be unique to this item. I feel like I have had to wrangle with every single programmable item I own, so this is par for the course. While some complain about the auto shut off feature (the warming plate turns off after two hours have passed since brewing), I find that to be a good thing for me. I have unfortunately, on more than one occasion, gone home and left the pot on only to return to stinking scorched coffee remains in the morning. So, this saves me from the nightmare of scrubbing away burned coffee (best case scenario) or writing a thank you note to the fire department for all their hard work on my behalf (worse case scenario). If I want hot fresh coffee all day, I just make less to begin with and brew a fresh pot as needed.All said, if you are looking for an inexpensive pot with some useful features (programmability, auto shut-off), this may fit the bill for you. Don't expect it to feel or perform like a $50+ pot, because it won't. But so far, I have had no problems with it and am enjoying my morning ""cup o' joe"" at the office.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7OXBRUDLBWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESXYAFQ#wasThisHelpful","R2I7OXBRUDLBWJ","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like a BIG cup of coffee first thing in the morning so I gravitate toward larger mugs. These mugs hold a full 16 oz. (2 cups) of liquid, so they are perfect for me. While the design isn't ""beautiful"", they are attractive in an abstract and artsy way. This particular color would be perfect for a beach house (if you are lucky enough to have one). They are also microwave and dishwasher safe. The microwave safe aspect appeals to me as well because their larger size would make it ideal for heating up a cup of soup.One disappointment, though, was that one of the mugs in the set was broken when it arrived. As soon as I picked up the box, I knew it had some broken pieces in it. It turns out the whole side of one of the mugs was broken out and it was easy to see why. The mugs are packed into a box at the factory that is divided into six cubes made of thin cardboard. The cups were inserted in between these flimsy walls with no padding to cushion them from damage. And then to make it worse, Amazon put them into a larger shipping box with absolutely no cushioning around the inner box so, of course, the inner box just slid around inside the bigger outer box, banging and clanging away. You don't have to be an engineer to know that is a poor way to protect (or in this case, NOT protect) breakable items.So, I would recommend the mugs themselves, but I would probably look for them at a store where you have the opportunity to open the box to inspect them and ensure that the mugs are still in one piece.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZTYOKTHF7EMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGR35G#wasThisHelpful","R2ZTYOKTHF7EMC","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will confess right up front that this is my first experience using a french press coffee maker, and I am apparently no good at it. Many coffee lovers have told me that a french press is the way to go if you are a true coffee ""aficionado"" ; that coffee has a better taste. That may well be true when someone else is doing it, but is certainly NOT true when I make it. Mine just tasted scorched, in spite of repeated tries. I feel like I may be doing something wrong, but I have followed the directions precisely and each time have varied the amount grounds I use and the time I allow it to brew. It still doesn't taste as good to me as what comes out of my Keurig machine. So, I am a bit disappointed. Someone suggested that perhaps the machine is heating the water to too high of a temperature. That may be true, but since I have no experience with other french presses, I have nothing to compare it to. I will say that it is incredibly messy to clean after use, since the machine does not use filters. The grounds go to the bottom of the pot, and getting them out is tricky. Shake them into the garbage can? Wash them down the sink? I tried it both ways and it is just messy. For that reason alone I will stick to ""regular"" pots that use filters or pods.What I DO like about this product is the ability to use this as an electric kettle. It heats the water up quickly and works great for ""Just add hot water"" items like instant soups or tea bags.So, I give this item three stars. Some of my disappointment may be related to my inexperience with a french press, but after having given it a few tries, I am just not enjoying the resulting brew, or the mess it leaves behind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V216GAT60L6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHRHBSO#wasThisHelpful","R1V216GAT60L6U","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I sit at a desk for the majority of the day, and have problems with circulation in my legs. From what I have read, and what my doctor has told me, that increases my risk of blood clot formation. So, I decided to try these socks and see if it helped with the swelling and discomfort. They did.  I didn't see nearly as much swelling in my feet and ankles, and I felt more comfortable overall. They are tight, but not uncomfortably so. Doctors will tell you that if a compression sock is not hard to put on, then it is not going to be effective. These are snug, and putting them on is harder than a regular sock, but not so difficult as to be problematic.My biggest complaint about these socks is that they are unisex; you order according to shoe size, and the sizes are broken down according to men/women. So, the sock will say (for example) that a size small fits ""men's shoe size 4-6.5 and women's shoe size 5-8"". But the problem with that is that most men have much longer legs than women, and so the sock (I ordered a medium) extends all the way over my knee cap if I pull it up completely. So, I have to ""scrunch"" it down a bit, and that makes it a little uncomfortable in the knee area.Overall, I like these, and would have given them five stars had it not been for the problem with the extra fabric at the knee.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ETN6RRVDZNEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFZJ2N6#wasThisHelpful","R3ETN6RRVDZNEP","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dogs think these taste pretty good, but I don't recommend them unless you are the kind of person who would buy salmon scented air freshener for your home.When I first opened the bag, these treats did not smell overwhelmingly of salmon. But once the dogs ate them - WOW! For the next thirty minutes every room they breathed in smelled like a fish market. I gave them water, then a standard dog biscuit, but it didn't help cut the stink.The up side of these treats is that they are made in the USA, and salmon is the #1 ingredient (not surprisingly, based upon the smell). But the #3 ingredient is sucrose (sugar), which I don't understand. Why do manufacturers of dog treats think they need to add sugar? My dogs are both prone to yeast infections in their ears, and we were advised by the vet to avoid sugars and starches in their diet as much as possible. So, I doubt I will feed these treats to my dogs on a daily basis, for that reason alone.All said, these treats may be just the ticket for your dog if you can stand the smell and don't have a dog with health issues related to yeast. But if you do object to these ingredients, I would recommend looking at other glucosamine supplements for pets, such as chewable tablets, or at least treats that minimize the starches and sugars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DTGZMRL47LW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTCVWWY#wasThisHelpful","R1DTGZMRL47LW1","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was, and still am, a bit skeptical about the true usefulness of this tool. It purports to help predict the effects of aging on wine by mimicking the aging process in a matter of seconds, simply by dipping the ""copper dot"" at the end of the tool into a glass of wine. Each second in the glass supposedly equals one year of aging in the bottle. Sounds handy. But, how well it works is really anyone's guess...it hasn't been around long enough to bear out its predictions. So, for the short term, it is also presented as a way to ""age"" young wines in the glass in order to make them more drinkable.So, that is the only way that I can assess its value at this point, and for me, in that regard, it is a waste of money. I have dipped it into $60 wines and $7 wines, and for me, the difference is not significant. And when I could actually taste the difference, it wasn't necessarily a positive one. I actually felt like it made the wine taste a bit like metal. Sort of like when a piece of aluminum foil touches a filling in your mouth...Now in all fairness, my husband also tried the same test, and he felt like it did subtly change the characteristics of the wine and made the wine a bit more, in his words, ""smooth"". I didn't get that feel, but everyone's palate is different. I have seen a far more positive effect on wine simply by using an aerator.So, here is my advice. If you are into wine gadgets, and feel you have a fairly sophisticated palate, you may appreciate this tool. And, you may even elect to cellar your bottles based upon the Clef's predictions regarding aging. But, if you are a casual wine drinker who simply wants a smoother glass of wine at the table, invest in an aerator and skip this gadget.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BEPAL9EKFPEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0BOAD2#wasThisHelpful","R3BEPAL9EKFPEZ","A1TH5UXT33E7RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TH5UXT33E7RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Crochet has been a passion of mine for quite a while, and I am always looking for new and interesting patterns to try. This book has some really beautiful designs, especially for women's wear. There is a fantastic wrap in a spiral theme (gorgeous), and a couple of sweaters that are simply stunning. I know I will be making a few of the designs. However, like many ""fashion"" crochet pieces, the yarns that are called for tend to be very light weight (lace or sport) which are exceptionally hard to come by in my area. To make things in these weights, I inevitably have to order my yarns online, so it becomes cost prohibitive. I would really love to see some options for trendy, fashionable things made in worsted or DK.My only other criticism of the garments in this book is that many of the sweaters are pullovers in a very close-fitting style, which aren't very flattering on me.

"This is a really pretty little bed that was relatively easy to put together. It took me about an hour, but that was because I was doing it alone. Had I had some help, it would have gone much quicker. You really need someone to hold the side rails steady as you insert the slats that form the mattress support, and it's also nice to have someone to hold up the ends of the bed as you attach the headboard and foot board. I propped them up with pillows, which worked, but two additional helping hands would have been better.The finish on this looks nice. To me, it looks more like a dark walnut shade than espresso, but that worked great with my other dark-stained furniture in the room.I didn't actually get this bed for a toddler; I got it for my dog (yep - the dog has his own bed). He is a large breed (100lbs.) that developed bone cancer and had to have a leg amputated. He slept with us, but can no longer jump up onto the bed. So, I purchased an orthopedic-style crib mattress and put this little bed next to ours. Now, he has his own safe-height, comfortable bed to sleep on. I left one of the slatted side rails off (not the frame support rail) to make it easier for him to get in and out of the bed, and it did not impact the overall strength of the frame at all.

A billiant story of how robots would react to real life situations, this novel has a dramatic plot and will leave you turning the pages until the very end.  Well worth the read and I would recommend it to any other sci fi fan.  Vadim Babenko is truly an awesome author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BIK1HOHXU684/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1QB2FI#wasThisHelpful","R1BIK1HOHXU684","AMTK0AKATZEBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMTK0AKATZEBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jack is a main character that will pull you in and plant you in your seat, turning page after page until the story is over.  The seventh book of the Jack Lazar series, Kevin Sterling places Jack in a plot so mysterious and terrifying that it takes over 300 pages for Jack to find his way out.  Better yet, Sterling even fins a way to place romance in the midst of murder and international terror, making a story so good that you can't put it down.  This is series well worth reading and sinking into, you won't be disappointed.  I kept myself up late reading night after night, and I wanted more when it was over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTFZEEIYDTHVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSI2YUE#wasThisHelpful","RTFZEEIYDTHVN","AMTK0AKATZEBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMTK0AKATZEBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suppose that every girl falls in love with that ""bad boy"" at some point in their lives, and ""Boy in a Band"" by Lisa Loomis encapsulates that story in a way that is both meaningful and powerful.  Morgan Mallory, the main character, is just like any other young girl, and when she meets Matthew O'Conner (the boy in a band) she cannot help but to fall in love with him.  In a story filled with twists and turns, will Morgan be able to find herself and make the right decisions?  Only the end of the novel will make it clear, and with such a gripping plot, you won't want to put it down until you find out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21NUKCSLASDK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007F1VSLW#wasThisHelpful","R21NUKCSLASDK4","AMTK0AKATZEBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMTK0AKATZEBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Luckily ""The Seeker"" is not just a novel, but a series.  Don't be afraid to just go ahead and buy the whole set, because you will love them, and after you first meet Ember Wells, you will want to follow her story to the very end.  Ditter Kellen is an author whose talent cannot remain hidden.  Ember slides deep into her fears, and you will have to read to the very end to find out if she escapes unscathed.  This would be a great beach read, as you can just lose yourself and the world around you as you sink into the story.

"Cross stitching is something that my wife has wanted to learn for awhile, so when I saw this book, I decided to go on and get it for her.  This book is definitely a quick way to learn, a crash course of sorts, and she has really enjoyed it.  The author shows you how to practice cross stitching, and also shows you how to stitch quickly.  This book covers the basics, along with telling you about all the materials that you need.  The many different types of stitches are outlined, and the author also provides you with patterns to go by.

"Pines is the first Blake Crouch novel that I have read, and I really enjoyed it.  I am so glad that it is part of a trilogy!  The Sidekick really enhanced my reading and understanding of the novel, and it really added depth to my understanding of the story.  Ethan Burke makes a great main character, and the depth of the character of David Pilcher and the questions he raises about humanity itself are very thought provoking.  There were some underlying themes and symbols in the story that I might not have picked up on if it had not been for this sidekick.  I wasn't too keen on the alternate endings though.  I was glad to be able to connect to other readers of this novel.  As with any other Sidekick, the reading recommendations have proved to point me to some other good books as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27G2Z2X7BQ398/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQBKDIU#wasThisHelpful","R27G2Z2X7BQ398","AMTK0AKATZEBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMTK0AKATZEBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took the SAT years ago, and I had used a prep book, but I don't think it was nearly as good as this one.  My niece will be taking the SAT this year, and I bought this to help her.  I realize that the SAT had changed over the last few years, but until I looked at this book, I didn't realize how much.  Evidently they are testing more know on the true reading and writing skills instead of your ability to decipher analogies.  This book, while definitely not a crash course in reading and writing, is great preparation for how this test will phrase questions to you in the writing and reading portions of the SAT.  This book will be especially helpful to my niece, who has had very limited exposure to the SAT.  The only thing that I did not like about the book was that it did not cover other portions of the test, but this book will be a great point of reference in her studies for the reading and writing skills portion of this important test.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8ZJCYCMPEBTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIACUUA#wasThisHelpful","R8ZJCYCMPEBTY","AMTK0AKATZEBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMTK0AKATZEBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I can use it from a good distance away, and it paired easily with my iPhone 5s.  I occasionally work in a woodshop as well, and the dust has been no hindrance at all.

"I really enjoyed the next installment of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, Shadows by J.R. Ward.  I also enjoyed having this Sidekick to go along with it.  The vampire genre is really getting some excellent attention right now, and there are some awesome authors out there.  J.R. Ward is definitely one of them.  Trez and iAm are brothers bound by a traumatic upbringing.  One of the characters that I felt I could really identify with was Rhage, who is kind of the werewolf/morphing style characters in the book. He is so scared of turning that any emotion at all frightens him.  Their society is going through massive changes, and each class of society is trying to cope with this new democracy in their own manner.The Sidekick discusses some 'what if' alternate endings that I didn't really care a whole lot about, but the author also discussed some open ended questions that the book left.  It really gives you something to look forward to in future novels in this series.One of the things that was super awesome about this book is the discussion of vampires and vampire romance as a literary theme.  Starting with Dracula the author outlines how important physical attraction has been in both vampire novels and movies.  This has really shown through in recent series such as The Vampire Diaries and Twilight.The Sidekick also discusses societal roles, especially that of females, and class distinctions that are evident throughout the book.  So many themes that are evident in the novel can be clearly seen in our society today.  I enjoyed the authors discussion of this and wished that she had spent a little more time on it.The other really cool thing that the author of this sidekick does is to point you to other similar series, comparable to the Shadow series.  The Sidekick definitely helps you dive farther into the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14BL6Z9YQQHUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSNVHCI#wasThisHelpful","R14BL6Z9YQQHUH","AMTK0AKATZEBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMTK0AKATZEBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Western thinking has affected all of us I suppose, and not all of what we have learned is healthy for us.

"This is a great book for any sci fi lover.  Except for the aliens, this book is not terribly fantastical.  A comet destroying the Earth is definitely not that far fetched of an idea.  All of the major world superpowers, and even some counties that are not superpowers have huge nuclear arsenal.  I would be scared to know the true destruction that a nuclear warhead could create.  As the book points out, the world today is made up of so many different and complex societies, which makes the idea of evacuating the entire planet such a difficult proposition.  Think of putting a Hindu that worships cows right next to an American cattle farmer on a spaceship and taking them both light years away.

"This book is well written, with deeply developed characters and a plot that most people who live in the real world can see themselves in to some varying degree.  I am a funeral director, so anyone who writes obits for a living, whether or not they are fantastical, is someone that I can relate to.  The author shows you how life can just drift sometimes, and you don't really know where you are in relation to anything or anyone else.  While I think that the extreme feminist movement has been something very detrimental to our modern society (shoot me if you must), I found the wife as a character to be slightly grating.  Taking a picture of a modern or even post modern marriage is difficult to do with words, but Cacoyannis does it well.  This was quite an interesting book and it was well worth the read.

He finds the part of the grounding that he needs in a local Alcoholics Anonymous group, and the strength that he finds there helps to carry him through many of his troubles with a pep in his step.  The book shows the importance of having something to believe in, a value system of some type that defines right and wrong in an individuals life.  Living and working on his family's ranch, Paul finds joy in the midst of hard work.

"Mary E. Sims lays out a very interesting plot in this novel.  Storylines that include religion of any sort has always interested me, and this book held my attention very well.  The novel opens a vein of good and evil contrasting and coexisting, and luckily the flow never stops up.  Good and evil play important parts in this book, as the plantation owner is seen as bad in the fact that he fathers 17 illegitimate children with one of his slaves.  He can be portrayed at some points because he frees the mother of the children.  The boys training for the priesthood make a real interesting part to the story.  The divine and the occult seem to exist simultaneously in this book, and resolution is never fully given to which one is right and which one is wrong, you just have to read it and decide for yourself.  The contrast of the ruling class (plantation owner, overseer) and the ruled, or oppressed, give an interesting taste to the story, as the Civil War looms in the future as almost a character in itself.

"Roxanne Juravlea is an excellent children's writer, and this book is exceptional.  Lisa and Bradley are characters that most any child can identify with, and their desire for adventure is one that anybody, young or old, can feel inside their own heart.  My mother was an elementary school librarian, and there is a special place in my heart for children's books.  I can remember as a child being stuck in a boring vacation camp while my parents went off and did exciting things.

"I think any one of us would be lying to ourselves if we said that we'd never had a problem with self confidence.  I really enjoyed this book and the author's take on the subject matter.  It is big enough to contain lots of information, yet small enough to be easy to read quickly.  The author challenges you to change your mindset and behavior, and play to your specific skill set to gain for self confidence.

"Don't sell yourself short!  Life is there for the taking, you just need the energy to grab ahold of it.  This book outlines the importance of energy in everyday life.  A lack of energy will hamper your success in both your professional and personal life.

"My wife has gotten really good lately at making arts and crafts, especially crocheting different things.  She has made so many different things that I thought it would be a good idea to market some of them, I just wasn't sure how.  I had heard of Etsy, but I didn't know that much about about it.  This book does a great job of telling you what Etsy is and what the site does.  The author does a really good job of outlining the benefits of selling craft items on Etsy.  Ashton tells you what items will sell best, and how to target and brand yourself to a specific market.  He even tells you how to take the best pictures of the items that you are selling.

The author does a great job defining both acid reflux and constipation, along with all of the things that may cause these problems.  He also outlines what foods are good to eat and what foods are bad to eat when you have these conditions.  One of the things that I liked best about this book was that the author outlines natural remedies that will help alleviate the pain from these conditions, and I really like natural remedies over medicine.

It works great for transporting stuff like that.  It has held up to all the abuse that I have given it.  I really like the pocket on the side, it works great for stuff I need to get to quickly.

"I love crime and conspiracy books.  This title did not disappoint me at all.  This author is very talented at making his story come alive in the reader's imagination.  Paul Chaise makes a great hero for the story.  Stuart Yates is a splendid author, rendering a unique and twisting plot with characters of great depth.  The idea of Paul retiring to sell property interested me from the beginning, as my wife is a real estate agent, and the ideas in this book are not too terribly far fetched.  The conflict between the gangsters, Paul, Paul's client, and SIS leads to a suspense filled, page turning novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I could barely even put it down just to eat.  This book is awesome!  I hope to see a lot more from Stuart G.

"I really enjoyed this book, even though a lot of the information it contains scares the willies out of me.  Once the author gave his credentials, I felt that I could really trust him, since he is a former Federal agent, dealing exclusively with the food industry.The Paleolithic diet and lifestyle just makes sense on so many levels.  It is obvious that our ancestors had much more energy than we do today. Why? Because they ate so much better than we do today, as none of their foods were processed.Gary gives a great amount of detailed information on how food is grown and produced in the United States today. Also he focuses on the changes that have taken place over the last several generations.  The food we eat today is not the food our great grandparents ate.  What he says in this book makes good sense to me. My own grandpa lived on a farm all of his life. Much of what he ate was grown in his own garden.  He passed in his chair, in his own home, on his own farm, at the age of 94.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33AC2FM398PM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHSUZU6#wasThisHelpful","R33AC2FM398PM0","AMTK0AKATZEBL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMTK0AKATZEBL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book by the marvelous Algerian writer, who writes under the pseudonym of Yasmina Khara, has written this story of the last day in the life of Muamar Gaddaffi.  This short book (or novella), is written in the first person with Gaddaffi as the narrator.  What does a man who knows he will not see another day think of in his last hours.What does a man think of?? His accomplishment?? His missed opportunities?? His mistakes (if he made any)?? Or does his life flash before him??These are the questions that Khadra tries to answer.  From the time of his childhood, Gaddaffi knew that he was destined for greatness.  He was a willful fatherless child who brought nothing but pain and misery to his mother.  Mostly he wanted to know the true story of his father (which he was not to learn for years).He talks about his time in military training and the friends he made (who later helped him lead the coup dâetat that overthrew the King). He talks about his children and his family, his hatred for how he was treated by his tribe when he was growing up, even though they had paid for his education.  More than anything he talks about what he had done for Libya and how he had made his country respected all over the Moslem world.Itâs the ravings of a psychotic drug addict.  I wonder if it was true that at the end of his life, Gaddaffi like Hitler had become a drug addict?  Is it true or is Khadra giving in to rumor and innuendo?  The end is Gaddaffi thoughts as he is dragged out of a water drain, beaten and eventually shot dead.Is it true that all Dictators and psychotic, narcissists who cannot see  when they have overstepped?

"Samuel Dashiell Hammett was born on a farm in Maryland in 1894.  He was known as âSamâ until he began using his middle name when he became a writer.  He left school at thirteen and âknockedâ around the country until 1915 when he joined the Pinkerton Agency. He enlisted in the Army in 1918 and served in the Motor Ambulance Corp. However, he became ill with the Spanish Flu and later contracted Tuberculosis. He spent most of his time in the Army as a patient in Cushman Hospital, Tacoma, Washington. While there he met a nurse, Josephine Dolan, whom he later married. They had two girls. In the 20s Hammett lived apart from his family because the doctors were afraid that he would transmit his TB to his daughters.  During this time he began to write short detective stories for the âpulpâ magazines.He went back to working for the Pinkerton Agency after the war but had to stop in 1922 because he was so debilitated from the Flu and TB.  He had a 100% disability pension from the Army and wasnât supposed to be working. His work with the Pinkerton Agency provided him with the inspiration for his first character âThe Continental Opâ.  CO was the first âhard-boilâ detective, written in Hammettâs distinctive tough guy style. Prior to the CO, all detectives were based on Sherlock Holmes and educated part-time amateurs.Hammett wrote most of his detective fiction during the period that he was living in San Francisco in the twenties. Specific streets and locations in San Francisco are frequently mentioned in his stories. He was first published in 1922.  Mostly known for his authenticity and realism in his writing, Hammett drew on his experiences as a Pinkerton operative (Ward was able to trace some of his stories to actual cases that Hammett worked on as a Pinkerton). Hammett said, ""All my characters were based on people I've known personally, or known about from my work as a detectiveâ.  Hammett became an alcoholic during this time and also wrote advertising copy to make ends meet.His five novels that made him famous were all originally published as installments of âpulpâ magazines (except for The Thin Man). They were:  Red Harvest (published on February 1, 1929), The Dain Curse (July 19, 1929) both featuring the Continental Op, The Maltese Falcon (February 14, 1930) The Glass Key (April 24, 1931) The Thin Man (January 8, 1934).  Hammett was brought to Hollywood in the early 30s where he wrote the following screenplays: After the Thin Man"", 1936; ""Shadow of the Thin Man"", 1941; ""The Glass Key"", 1942; ""Watch on the Rhine"", 1943.In early 1942, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hammett again enlisted in the United States Army. He was a disabled veteran of World War I, a victim of tuberculosis, and a Communist, but he pulled strings in the movie community in order to be admitted. He served as a sergeant in the Aleutians Islands, where he edited an Army newspaper. In 1943, while a member of the military, he had co-authored The Battle of the Aleutians with Cpl. Robert Colodny. During this time he developed emphysemaDuring the 1950s he was investigated by Congress. He testified in 1953 before the House Un-American Activities Committee about his own activities, but refused to cooperate with the committee. His stand led to his being blacklisted, along with others as a result of McCarthy hearings.In 1931, Hammett embarked on a 30-year affair with playwright Lillian Hellman. He wrote his final novel in 1934.  Hellman speculated in a posthumous collection of Hammett's novels that ""I think, but I only think, I know a few of the reasons: he wanted to do new kind of work, he was sick for many of those years and getting sicker.""  He died in 1961 from lung cancer.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com  zebsblog@gmail.com","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24WXXB6FWI80D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080277640X#wasThisHelpful","R24WXXB6FWI80D","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dancing with the Devil in the City of God: Rio de Janeiro on the Brink  by Juliana BarbassaJuliana Barbassa was born in Rio and left as a teenager.  She spent twenty one years travelling the world and returned home in 2010.  She wanted to see how it had changed and was preparing for the World Cup in 2014 and the summer Olympics in 2016.  What she found was a city that had exploded in size with a population of 13 million.  It had all of itsâ old flavor but also the same problems as any unplanned third world country.Rio, like almost any âmajorâ city in the world is not like itsâ country, it is a âconceptâ and an illusion, a unique place apart from anywhere else.  For Barbassa returning home is both happy and sad.  The downtown has become a sparkling city (the Marvelous City) with all the amenities of many cities in the USA, including a new subway and even Starbucks.  But itâs still the same Rio that most ex-pat Cariocaâs know.  Residents of Rio are called Cariocas after the creek where the first settlements were built. The creek itself has disappeared underground and like Fleet Creek in London is now used as a sewer.She travels all around the city and environs to see how it has expanded and prospered.  First she takes a tour of some of the favelas, many that were notorious in the past but have been cleaned out by the Police and Military. The drug dealing gangs were forced out and the Police now have a strong present in the areas but there are still few utilities, and mail is seldom delivered except to the street corners closest to Rio.But even with the growth of West Rio (the area around Jacarapagua) there are still the failures of the government to ensure that the environment is protected.  Buildings (40 story apartments) go up without sewers or treatment plants.  The discharge from this housing goes directly into the lake and sea areas to be used for the 2016 Olympics.Multiple lane highways have been built by the government to give access to the area which is being privately developed.  Many structures are put up so shoddily that they begin to show stress cracks (as do the highways) after a few years because they havenât been properly anchored to the ridges they are built on. But Barbassa has hope for the city and the Cariocas after seeing how they were able to handle the 2014 World Cup.  Only time will tell.

"NOTE: this was a free eBook from NetGalleyThis is the first book in this series about a Victorian gentleman who is an investigator as an avocation.  Charles Lenox is the second son of a baronet, but even then is set a life of independent means.  With much time on his hands he likes to delve into the seedier side of life.Finch appears to be based closer to Allinghamâs Campion and Sayerâs Lord Wimsy, then to Conan Doyleâs Holmes.  Finch has a nemesis in the police force, a âmanâ named Graham, a friend who is a Doctor and his friend from childhood Lady Jane Gray.Lady Jane asks Lenox to look into the death of her former maid Prudence Smith.  Smith has left her service to work in the same house as her fiancÃ©e.  Though reported as a suicide, Lenox determines that she had been murdered by poison.The house where Pru is murdered belongs to a powerful member of the current government.  Temporarily living at the house are two members of Parliament and a well-known member of âThe Cityâ.  Also present are two nephews of the owner.  One of them must be involved with the murder, but why?  Once you know why you will know who?The story is very atmospheric, and Finch does a fine job in giving the reader a feel for the Victorian era.

"Following up on the same time line that his prior book, âAfrikan Reichâ, that dealt with Nazi Germany in the former Belgium Congo (Kongo), Saville move across the Mozambique Channel to the island of Madagascar.  The island was ceded to the Germans by the Vichy French government as part of their treaty to end their participation in World War II.Unlike in our time, the Jews of Europe werenât resettled in Eastern Europe, but (by 1952) on the Island of Madagascar.  The resettlement was supposed to allow the Jews to live on the Island in exchange for their working in the mines and vanilla farms.  Their allowed their own city, free from German intercession, but most of the transportees are sent to live in German âCompanyâ towns where they are starved and brutalized.Burton Cole has worked in covert operations for the British and also as a mercenary in the Kongo.  Now working again with the British, he is going to be smuggled onto the island to meet with the Jewish Resistance.  The idea is to blow up the major port on the island and incite an island-wide revolt.  But Cole has a second reason for going to the island.He was involved with a woman in Kongo before he had to escape from the colonial governor.  He found out that she had been transported to Madagascar.  He also found out that she was pregnant with his child.  Once on the island he is told by the Resistance, that the Germans are killing Jewish babies, and sterilizing the women who come to their maternity hospitals.Burton is determined to find her while carrying out his mission.  What makes Savilleâs books so interesting is the plausibility of his timeline, and of the governmental structures he sets up.

"Review of âEmergenceâ âResistanceâ and âAscendanceâ  by John BirminghamThis is the first time Iâve ever written a review for a trilogy all at once.  But since these books have come out so close together, Iâve decided to combine their reviews and add a little at the end of the second and third when Iâve finished.  So technically there will be three separate reviews, but then if you donât like that, sue me.This is the story of a bozo, who ends up being the âsaviorâ of the human race, through no action of his own.  Dave Hooper is a fuck-up and has been his whole life.  Heâs never learned to keep his mouth shut or his opinions to himself.  In an ocean of tact, Dave doesnât have a thimble-full.  If brains were money, Dave would always be a day late and a dollar short.  Ok, get the premise.Dave is the âsafetyâ officer for oil drilling company.  His job is to make sure that all the companyâs platforms meet OSHA rules.  When there is a catastrophe on one of his rigs, Dave takes a chopper out to see how bad it is and what can be done to contain it.  Unfortunately, itâs not a âblow-outâ leak, it much worse than an oil spill.It appears that the drillers, who had gone deeper than anyone had gone before, have punctured the envelope between our continuum and another.  The âotherâ is filled with creatures (think of bad guys from Middle Earth) who think of mankind as a mythical food source, once again open to them.  They are unstoppable by most humans and can only be stopped by multiple bullets or edged weapons (swords, pikes, halberds, etc.)By the time Dave gets to the platform, the âHordeâ has taken over large parts of the platform while the remaining humans have barricaded themselves into areas that prevent the Hordes from attacking them all at once.  (Yes, this is getting wordy, but, remember that Iâm writing for three.)Dave manages to killâs one of the âBattle Mastersâ and in doing so absorbs all of âhisâ memories and superhuman strength.  He uses an ancient style weapon that is an axe on one side and a hammer on the other.  For whatever reason he names it âLucilleâ.  With Lucille he is able to stop the attack by the Horde.OK now it begins to get complicated and comical.  Dave is âtakenâ by a military section of the US government, who are trying to decide what he is or has become.  But in between he helps to defend both New Orleans.  This is all you need to know about the first book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J6RSEPG9HRIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PBEWY#wasThisHelpful","R2J6RSEPG9HRIB","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In late 1942 the Arndt family realized that working as slave labor in German industry was not going to save their lives.  They were already hearing the horror stories coming out of Poland as to the murders of the Jews who had been âresettledâ there.  When they were told by fellow workers that they were about to be replaces by âPolish forced laborâ from Eastern Europe, they knew their days were numbered.Thus began for these seven people, two and a half years of living underground, waiting for the Nazis to lose the war.  This is the story of survival and those who put their lives at risk to help save their Jewish neighbors.  The center of the group was the Arndts, the Father (Arthur, a doctor, and recipient of the Iron Cross First Class in WW 1), the wife (Lina), their son (Erich) and daughter (Ruth).  Also part of the group was a mother (Charlotte Lewinsky) and daughter (Ellen, who would become Erichâs wife) and a school friend of Erichâs (Bruno who would marry Ruth after the war).Dr Arndt had been a well-liked obstetrician in the part of Berlin they lived in.  His patients were both Jews and non-Jews and he treated all patients who came to his office, not matter the problem or ability to pay.  Many of the people who helped them get through the war were either patients or relatives of patients that the Doctor had helped over the years.The two main groups that helped them were the Gehres, Max and Anni, who were had a factory in nearby Kreuzberg and employed Erich and Bruno during most of the war.  Erich and Bruno lived most of the time in a closed off storeroom in the attic of the factory.  By the end of the war, all seven of them were living in the factory.  The second group were Gretchen and Karl Dubler, who hid Charlotte and Ellen at their summer house before they escaped to Berlin. They also supplied the families with ration cards they bought on the black market from friend.At times they worked as seamstresses, nurses (Ruth was a trained nurse, as was Ellen). They worked as cooks and cleaners for a Colonel Wehlen of the Wehrmacht, who also ran a Black Market group and didnât care if they were Jews.  Ruth and Ellen both worked for Senor and Senora Santaella, the Spanish Ambassador and his wife, as nannies for their children until they left for Spain near the end of the war.  One of the great anecdotes in the story is when the son Erich ended up beating up once of his fellow workers (a Hitler Youth) who questioned his faithfulness to the Fuhrer.With the war coming to an end, they were bombed out of their housing and all of them ended up in the factory.  When the Russian came (in February 1945), they set up a command post across the street from the Factory.  One of the Russia soldiers came looking for loot and took Ruthâs watch.  When Charlotte went to complain, she met a Jewish soldier who got them food, and protection from the rampaging soldiers.  They were all able to come to America after the war and raise families.

"This is the third book in the Colin Pendragon murder mystery series.  The books are based in Victorian England where Colin lives quietly with his life partner Ethan Pruitt.  Because he is wealthy, he has little to fear from his relationship with Ethan, though it does present certain problems, least of all the snide remarks from his landlady.The books are set-up very much like a Sherlock Holmes story, with Colin being called in on cases that people feel that Scotland Yard isnât paying enough attention to.  Inspector Varcoe is Colinâs nemesis.  The distraught wife of Edmond Connicle has called in Colin because her husband has disappeared. When a body, burnt beyond recognition, is found on the property, a Voodoo fetish is found underneath the corpse.Varcoe immediately suspect the couples West African scullery maid of having killed her employer.

But why is someone killing these people and are the fetishes just a âred herringâ.Colin must delve into both the fetishes and the Connicle family.  It seems that there is a stain of insanity in the Connicle familyâs past which has led people to believe that the family is cursed.  Colin and Evan set out to follow both trails but are forced to find extra help.  They find Paul who lives by his wits on the shabby streets of Londonâs worst neighborhood.Paul can follow anyone anywhere because evading the law is second nature to him.

"This is the middle volume of The Shattered Sea Trilogy that continues two years after the end of Half a King. The story now has two narrators â Brand and Thorn.  Father Yarvi is a background supporting character in this story, and his tale continues as small anecdotes related by other others that are interspersed in the story.Thorn is a young woman who wants to be a warrior in the footsteps of her father, but woman are seldom chosen for training.  The master- at-arms, sabotages Thornâs sword during her final test, but intervenes and places her on one of his ships. But, Thorn quickly realizes that she is a pawn in a dangerous political game.The High King is dissatisfied the new King of Gettland, to whom Father Yarvi is the main counselor. When Yarvi hears that the High King is raising troops to overthrow the upstart Gettland King.  Thorn and Brand (a young male warrior) are the two sides of a Janus coin. Thorn is touched by Mother War, while Brand is touched by Father Peace.  Thorn is the outgoing short trigger, and Brand is the introverted archetype âquietâ big man.They sail off on Yarviâs ship looking for allies in a projected war against the High King.  Of course it turns out to be much more difficult than anyone expected.  Though Thorn and Brand are opposites, of course they develop a close friendship and their attraction grows as the story goes on.  The exploration of gender ânormsâ is one of the strongest part of the character development.  Though in the humor of the story, Abercrombie show he hasnât left out his standard âlight handedâ touch.As always, Abercrombie is deft at his use of action and battle versus times when everyone sits around pontificating.  We learn a lot more about the âShattered Seaâ world, with hints that it is the result of a major apocalypse in the distant past.The last book of the trilogy, âHalf a Warâ is due this July (2015).Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PZCJ78YIESBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178429#wasThisHelpful","R3PZCJ78YIESBC","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is set in post-Civil War Philadelphia in 1869.  The North of the Country is just getting back on itsâ feet after the terrible carnage of the War.  Most people who were doing well before the war and doing even better during the war are now feeling the pinch as military contract demands wind down.  Edward Clark lives a pleasant life, even though he does have nightmares about his time during the war.Edward works for a daily newspaper, and is engaged to the daughter of a wealthy hat manufacturer.  The family would like a son-in-law with a more lucrative job, but Edward enjoys what he does.  His Editor assigns him to write a series of stories about the cityâs growing number of mediums/spiritualist.  Many families who lost sons in the war are desperate to find out the circumstances of their deaths.  For many of the families this means visiting a medium so as to contact their loved ones in a sÃ©ance.Clark and his editor are convinced that these mediums are nothing but charlatans, who are bilking the grieving families.  Clark is very familiar with magic and understands the sleights- of-hand that mediums use to dupe their customers.  Clark secret is that his famous magician father is in jail for having murdered his mother in front of an audience.  Because of this his name was changed and he was brought up by a stern coldhearted aunt.Clarkâs first investigation is of a woman named Lucy Collins, and though he uncovers how she did her tricks, Lucy found out about his past.  She threatened him with exposure unless he helped her expose her competitors.  When they visited a ârealâ medium, neither of them could explain how she knew what she knew about the two of them.  When the returned for a second sÃ©ance, the medium Lenora Grimes Pastor is murdered.So Lucy and Clark set out to find the murderer.  They investigate the other participants in the sÃ©ance and determine to confront the murderer at another sÃ©ance.  During their investigation, Clarkâs fiancÃ© finds out about Lucy and Clarkâs collaboration and calls off the wedding.  Of course they find out who the murderer is and during the sÃ©ance Mrs Pastor gives Clark the secret to how she âreallyâ contacts the dead.The characters are well presented and thought out.  They âfeelâ like people you would expect to meet in the normal course of the day.  The murder and the mystery about Mrs Pastor are âbelievableâ and well thought out.

"Before I discuss the book contents I want to give my opinion of the bookâs style.  If I didnât know better I would think that Carter was trying to write a satire on mystery books.  The people in the story, especially Nanette Hayes, are so childish and two dimensional that they come off as cartoonish.  On the second hand, the story and the plot and everything else that goes with it, seem to come out of the Nancy Drew genre.  Am I being too hard on the book, I donât think so, but thatâs just my opinion.NOTE: so why did I read this book?  I was given an invitation (via NetGalley) by the publisher to do so and review.OK, so Nanette is a street musician in New York City.  She looks like Grace Jones and plays the saxophone.  One day somebody dumps a wad of money into her case ($60,000) .  Nanette isnât your normal street busker, oh no, she has a Masterâs in French and lives with her straight lace middle class boyfriend in a âmeanâ neighborhood.  At this time she has broken up with her boyfriend for the upty-seventh time.  She allows another street musician to crash at her âpadâ one night because he is homeless.In the morning, she wakes up to find the âhomelessâ guy is dead with an ice-pick (an ice- pick, where do you get an ice-pick these days) in his throat.  When she checks for an ID it turns out heâs an undercover NYC cop.  Well sheâs got the money, so she might as well spend it, right?  Sure no one could be looking for it.  The dead guy must have fallen down on the ice-pick, wow talk about bad luck.So, now the book really gets silly as the âmysteryâ has something to do with a saxophone that was given to Charlie Parker by a mobster to play at his wedding.  The sax is made of gold and a million dollar stash of heroin is in the bell.  It was stolen the same night as the wedding.  (As if the heroin would be any good after all these years.)  And now the book gets really silly.  I donât want to discuss it.  Needless to say I wasnât thrilled by the book.  It might be good for âtweensâ except for the drugs, sex and bad language. Oh well.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R143KOJBVQ7HY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QN352W4#wasThisHelpful","R143KOJBVQ7HY7","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During the Polish-Soviet War of 1920-1921, Isaac Babel was attached to the Red Army Cavalry that fought in Southern Poland.  Most of this area had been part of the Russian Empire for centuries and was well known to him. This was also part of the âinfamousâ Pale of Russia.The Pale of Russia was the eastern part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth before it was partitioned between Austria, Prussia and Russia at the end of the eighteenth century.  This was the area that Jews were ghetto-ized into.  Most of it was small towns (schtetls) that were little more than a handful of huts and dirt roads.Babel wrote about the good and the bad of the Soviet Army as they tramped through this area fighting the Polish Army and the population.  The effect of the war on both the armies and the people are what he wrote about in the diary, he kept during the war.Babel can be both satiric and ironic in his depiction of the violence or war and can be blasÃ© and matter of fact about murder and mayhem.  He shows how was can make some men sinners and others saints, and how killing can become mundane.More than anything else, Babelâs narrator deals with the change in status of the Russian-Jewish intelligentsia and how theory changes when confronted with reality.  For most socialist intellectuals, the theory of âall power to the Sovietsâ, had been an idea had now become the norm.  As Babel found out, effectuating an ideal is much harder than talking about it.Written in a very Russian style of fiction mixed with fact Babel established himself as a new voice in the new Russia.  He didnât âcleanâ up the language of the troops any more than the horrors they saw or committed.  It could easily be American troops in Iraq.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.c","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROKPWCXAV3WP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTX0TY2#wasThisHelpful","ROKPWCXAV3WP6","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Against a long lists of Dystopias (like Hunger Games and Insurgent) Coleman has written a Utopian look at the future.  Based on the ending of the book this is a projected series, but the length is probably based on the reaction to the first book.  It is a successor to such late nineteenth century novels âErewhonâ and âLooking Backwardsâ and the twentieth century novels of Ursula K LeGuin.  The hardest part of writing a Utopian novel is the cynicism of the twenty-first century, so that it doesnât read as a satire.Everything begins with the formation of a philanthropic group set-up by five of the richest people in the world, who become known as the âGroup of Fiveâ (always referred to in italics).  They are the ultimate do-gooders who combine their resources to put together projects to combat hunger, poverty and illiteracy.  But they want to make a much bigger impact on the world, then just a hodge-podge of programs.They come up with the idea of electing a âKing of the Worldâ who will help to channel the resources spent on the worldâs militaries, into massive programs to create desalinization plants to provide âcleanâ water to everyone, programs to eradicate disease, and free education for everyone through University.  In some ways it mimics the positive side of Robert Heinleinâs âA Stranger in a Strange Landâ.  Using the internet they plan to present three candidates to the world but settle on one amazing man by the name of Emmet Comanche Constitution Madison Taylor.With the amazing amount of resources the GO5 buy a piece of Mongolia and set-up their own city-state of Augusta.  They use the best and the brightest to build and run their city plus a small army to protect their state.  Of course there have to be bad guys who want to stop this vote for KOTW, and they are China, Russia, USA, Britain, Venezuela and others.  The pro- countries are India (which now has a veto in the Security Council), Sweden and Thailand.  (Strangely, Africa is hardly mentioned at all in the book.)Once there is the announcement of the campaign, the bad guys plan all kinds of ways to prevent the vote from happening and to assassinate Emmett.  This is where it bogs down into polemics about the problems of the world and some radical solutions. (India and Pakistan will play a cricket match every ten years to determine who controls Kashmir.)  On many occasions the rhetoric gets into some flights of fantasy that would make Alice, Dorothy and Polyanna seem like depressives.  The end of the book states âThe Beginningâ.NOTE: KOTW is published by âThe Moon Above, Pte Ltdâ based in Singapore.  The company is owned by Randall Coleman.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S08UYX8KYIJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TP338CU#wasThisHelpful","R2S08UYX8KYIJX","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In 1963 Modiano (the 2014 Nobel Laureate) bought a copy of a 1941 paper (Paris Soir) at a book kiosk in Paris.  In the paper he found a notice about a missing fifteen year old girl.  He then spent the next thirty years trying to track down what happened to the girl (Dora Bruder) and finding out who she was.The girl was the daughter of Eastern European Jews from Prague.  The family had moved to Paris before the war to escape the Nazis.  The father was an unskilled laborer and the mother a housewife.  In order to protect their daughter they had not registered her with the âDepartment of Jewish Affairsâ, but had placed her in a catholic convent school.The girl had run off from the school and the parents were desperate to find her.  Modiano had little luck in finding out much about the girl except that she had been found and returned to her parents.  She later ran off again.  Ultimately, her parents and Dora were all sent to Auschwitz, where they were murdered.Much of the book also deals with Modiano and his father.  His father was a descendent of Spanish Jews who had first fled to Salonika and later to Prague.  During the war his father was twice picked-up by the Police and interned in Drancy (a holding camp for Jews and criminals) but was released both times.  His family survived the war with his father working in the Black Market and the Resistance.Having been born in 1945, Modiano heard both his fatherâs and others stories of times spent under the Occupation.  His search for Dora and her family history, is a way of Modiano searching for his own familyâs experiences during the War.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKK9BW6II304L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7F70EQ#wasThisHelpful","RKK9BW6II304L","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless you are a geologist yourself, you are not going to find this book very useful (at least in my non-geologist opinion).  The first half of the book (the first three chapters) relates the geological history of the Italian Peninsula, and gives a history of the Etruscan civilization.  Pizzorusso discusses how the Etruscans made us of the âTuffâ stone in Tuscany as both building materials and for the digging of tunnels for aqueducts and funeral vaults.There then is a section on the hot-springs and steam vents in the area around Naples that Virgil used as his example for the entry into the underworld which was later used by early Christians as their version of Hell.  Dante later used it as the background in his âDivine Comedyâ where Virgil acted as his guide.  This is then followed by a discussion of gemstones and the makings of pearls.The last three chapters are about Da Vinci (finally, remember him from the title). Mostly the discussion has to do with the use of geological forms in his paintings. Lastly there is a discussion of the creation of different pigments for paints and what minerals they could be derived from.So for me this book was not only misnamed (what does tweeting have to do with any of this) I donât understand its use.  Much of whatâs in here wouldnât interest even an art history student much less the quotidian reader.  In many ways it reads like a proposal for a master or doctoral thesis.  So for me itâs a one, for art history itâs a two, for geology itâs a three and a half.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BTSJW2HIT3H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940613000#wasThisHelpful","R2BTSJW2HIT3H3","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is a polemic on three of the major players on the British side during World War II; Winston Churchill (who was prime minister), Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery (military commander of the British Army), and Admiral Louis Mountbatten.  Mostly Arnold discusses how the many kudos that these three men received, werenât merited by what they did.To begin with Churchill, he does give him credit with keeping-up the morale of the British nation during itsâ most trying time (during the Blitz), but that his self- described âmilitary geniusâ was a myth.  Just like in WWI, where he was behind the Gallipoli debacle, almost all of his ideas in WW2 turned out badly.His demand for assistance to Greece/Crete so weakened the British North African Army, that they werenât able to hold off the Afrika under Rommel until he was at the door to Cairo. Rommel was stopped at the first Battle of El-Alamain but Churchill then fired the generals in charge and replaced them with Montgomery.Montgomery who was to fight Rommel at a time when the Afrika Corp was one-half the size of the reinforced British, was then given the laurels for stopping Rommel.  But per Arnold, anyone with the knowledge of Rommelâs shortcomings and with twice the men and tanks as their adversary could have won that battle.  But Montgomery failed to follow-up the victory and allowed the Afrika Corp to reassemble and make a defensive stand that prolonged the war. This is backed up from the war diary of Rommel and his second in command.Much of Arnoldâs discussion of Churchill and Montgomery has to do with their mutual admiration society.  Unlike most generals, Churchill always backed Montgomery to the hilt no matter how inflammatory or insulting his comments about his Allies (and especially Eisenhower and Patton).  When Monty pushed Eisenhower to allow him to attack across the Rhine in Operation Market Garden, his planning was so inept that at the end, he was back to his starting line after massive casualties to the Airborne troop he used.Most of the American Generals could not deal with Montyâs need to always be in the forefront by calling his own press conferences and then taking credit for all that was done, even if he wasnât involved.  He bypassing of the northern shore of the Sheldt which protected Antwerp, led to a major battle (fought by the Canadians) later on and the loss of the use of the port for three more months.  .There are many stories relating to the problems of the British âold boyâ network in the choosing of officers and staff members.  It was more important as to who you went to school with than how good a tactician you were.Lord Louis Montbatten was a cousin of the Royal Family (his nephew Phillip was to marry Princess later Queen Elizabeth II) and seemed to lead a charmed life no matter what he did.  The invasion of Dieppe, had been put off by the naval high command, but Montbatten went ahead anyway.  After this disaster, he was promoted by Churchill and sent to South East Asia to fight the Japanese on the Malayan peninsula.Having planned an invasion for September 1945, he landed his troops on beaches that couldnât hold the weight of tanks or armored vehicles.  Thankfully the Japanese had already surrendered or his troops would have been sitting ducks.  After the war, he was sent to India to help with the partition of the colony into Moslem and Hindu parts.  In a hurry to get back to the Navy, he completed his job in fourteen weeks instead of the fourteen months that had been projected.  Problems with the partition have led to four wars between India and Pakistan and seventy years of animosity between those two nations.From the point of view of an American reader, all of these petty squabbles seem to be ridiculous.  Why not have the best and the brightest at the head of your military forces?  But considering the problems that we have had in Iraq and Afghanistan, by a military still fighting Vietnam, itâs understandable.  Like the British in WW2, our military has become too politically savvy for itsâ own good.This is a well documented and well written monograph, and gives a totally different look at the major players for the British in WWII.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15SHLUGIGSU8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS5XG6O#wasThisHelpful","R15SHLUGIGSU8B","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time this story was written in 2004, the wine industry like most of the world was sliding into a major recession.  Hardest hit among the wine regions in France was the Province of Armagnac.  The Lavoisier Vineyard had been the premier producer for over one hundred years.  Cognac is a type of brandy made from distilled white grapes that are aged for at least two years in oak barrels, then blended with other flavoring (such as herbs or fruit juice) to give each a distinct flavor.When their father died, he left one-third of the voting stock to each of his three children.  But like many siblings they had their differences and the oldest (Claude-Henri) eventually sold his stake to a Chinese Consortium and moved to Canada.  With the drop in sales the Chinese hire Benjamin Cooker and his assistant Virgile to look at the Chateau to see where it could be made more cost effective.  The two siblings who are running the Chateau (Marie-France and Pierre) are worried about losing control.When Pierre, who is the primary blender for the Chateau is found murdered it looks like the chance for his sister to hold onto the family vineyard is all but a fait-accompli.  The two remaining siblings will each inherit half of Pierreâs stock, and the sale of Claude-Henriâs windfall will give the Chinese fifty percent control.  At this point Benjamin decides to withdraw from his contract with the Chinese and try to solve Pierreâs murder.The thorn in all of this is that Benjaminâs first love (from thirty years ago) is living on a property, growing prize roses, very near to the Lavoisier Chateau.  Also, Virgile may be getting to close to the client, Marie-France, and their intimacy may cloud his judgment as to who killed Pierre.In true Winemaker fashion, it is written as a TV script after all, everything is wrapped up in a neat bundle at the end.  The bad guys go to jail, the Chateau is saved and Benjamin and Virgile drive off into the sunset.

"The subtitle of the book is a good summary of what the book is all about: A Village Called Wasteland and the Transformation of Rural China.  Meyer who first spent time in southern China as part of the Peace Corp, married a woman from northeastern China (Manchuria).  After being married for thirteen years, his wife (now a lawyer) took a job in Hong Kong.  Meyer (a travel writer and author) decided it would be a great time to visit her family in Manchuria and travel around the area.His wifeâs family was from a little town on the Songhua River outside of Jilin in the middle of Heilongjiang Province (Manchuria), called Wasteland.  All he could find out about the town was that it was declared a village in 1956.  Prior to 1949, it may have just been a group of houses off a side road.  After the takeover of the Communist Chinese it was declared a commune and the land in the area was flooded and turned into rice paddies.  The village was famous for the type of âsticky riceâ they grew known as âbig wasteland riceâ.Meyer (from Minnesota) spent three years living in the town which was just like a small town in the Middle West of the US.  He lived among his wifeâs aunt and uncles who had spent their whole lives in the village, from before World War 2.  They remembered the times when the land was owned by absent landlords, the wars of the Warlords (before WW2), the Japanese occupation.  They were there when the Russians chased out the Japanese and the war between the Communists and the Nationalists.Under the Communist Chinese they were forced into communes, attacked by the Red Guards during the âCultural Revolutionâ and were part of the first areas to be given private use of the land they lived on.  By the time Meyer went to live in Wasteland, the village was being swallowed up by a huge new Agribusiness called âEastern Resourcesâ.  Everyone in the village remembered his wife as a child (when she was called the Princess) before she married Meyer and went off to the US.  In the US she went to college and became a lawyer specializing in international law.Meyer spent much of his time traveling around the Province studying the wars between the Russian, Japanese and Chinese over this land.  He interviewed (he is very conversant in Mandarin) many of the local politicians and toured all the important Museums in the area.  In his own way Meyer gives the reader a history lesson as well as a discussion of the cultural changes to Manchuria during the twentieth century.For me though the best part of the book is his descriptions of the older people of the village of Wasteland.  These are the âcommon peopleâ of the area who have lived through all of the changes from the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1912, the Chinese Republic of 1912-1949, and under Communist rule.  His description of the small town atmosphere where everyone knows everyoneâs business is truly worth the read.  All during his stay in the village the old âauntiesâ question him as to when he will start a family. (At the time he was 39 and his wife Frances was 34.)  This is a great view of the changes to rural China (and the whole country) from ground level.

"On a June day in 1919, Alexander Woollcott, who was just back from the war (WW1), decided to invite some friends to have lunch at the Algonquin Hotel.  Everyone had a great time and someone said, âWhy donât we do this every day?â And so they did for ten  years until the âgreat depressionâ spread them all over the world in an effort to make a living and later to report on WW2.The âRound Tableâ was called the Vicious Circle by those who were members of this elite group that was to include the most famous newspaper columnists and reporters, writers (books and plays), and publishers (The New Yorker magazine began here).  One of the most famous was Dorothy Parker, but included Edna Ferber, Herman Mankiewicz, Harpo Marx and Robert Benchley.  Some, were famous for being famous, while others were to become famous, but their quips, quotes and jokes were reported in all the major New York papers and their âtableâ became a legend.If I have any complaint about Fitzgeraldâs book, itâs that he has this habit of giving us the addresses of everything.  When he writes about the protagonists he gives us all their home addresses, and those of the newspapers and the Broadway theatres, it can get annoying after a while.  The book begins with short biographies of the members in chapters for the newspaper writers, the on the Broadway peoples, those that went into the movies and radio, and the Theatres themselves.The last three sections are on the creation of the iconic âThe New Yorkerâ magazine, the speakeasies and brothels that were the habitue of the Table, and finally an epilogue of what happened to the most important members after WW2.  In parts it reads more like and encyclopedia or reference book, but itâs never pedantic or pedestrian.  The stories and anecdotes are especially worth the read.Well worth your time, if youâre interested in âThe Artsâ of this time period.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q77IMDL7VQKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493007572#wasThisHelpful","R3Q77IMDL7VQKU","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a different style of history.  It reads more like and historical novel, where the characters are more important than the actions of the military.  It gives you the story from the perspective of the people who fought on the side of the Republic.  Between 1936 and 1939 more than one hundred thousand volunteers poured into Republican Spain to try and stop the Nationalist troops under Franco.People who are familiar with the war have heard the stories about Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gelhorn, but most donât know that George Orwell, and John Dos Passos also fought on the side of the Republic.  Both Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro created world famous paintings for the 1937 Spanish Pavilion at the Paris Worldâs Fair.But it was the men who fought in the International Brigades (IB) and the doctors and nurses who worked in the 24 IB hospitals that really made a difference.  During the war they devised the first mobile blood bank, the use of triage in emergency situations and remarkable new ways of treating wounds from shrapnel and bullets.  The soldiers of the IB stopped the first attempt by Franco to take Madrid.On the fascist side the Germans were able to try out new theories of war, such as the use of carpet bombing to destroy cities and the morale of the people in them.  They were also able to try out many new weapons, most of which they later used in the âblitzkriegâ that helped them conquer most of Western Europe and large chunks of the Soviet Union.For the Soviet Union, it was their first try at creating a communist state outside of eastern Europe.  Their destruction of their anarchist and republican allies in battles in Barcelona was one of the reasons that the Republicans lost the war.  But for Stalin and company it was a lesson they would apply to Eastern Europe after World War Two.For anyone who likes to read about war from the viewpoint of the soldiers and civilians who lived through it, this is the book for you.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZLD9KZV56CYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1S0AC#wasThisHelpful","RZLD9KZV56CYP","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying that the idea of hitch-hiking from Australia (Tasmania) to England is in itself a great effort in itself.  But, when the trip is made by a socially inept, ego-centric pseudo socialist (think over empowered anti-westerner) mooch (or in socialist parlance: parasite), it tends to need a lot of forbearance.Probably what made this âmemoirâ the hardest to read was the downright âpeople should be happy to pick me upâ attitude of the author.  The idea that people might want money to take him somewhere is totally against his ethos.  But he has no trouble at times making fun (and being condescending) of those who give him rides and take him into their homes.  All of this is of course his due, because he is JAMIE MASLIN, extreme hitchhiker. (Give me a break).He prides himself on getting along with people who donât speak English, as if this should be expected of any person in any country, but doesnât even try to learn a few words in the local language.  If he does he never mentioned it.  Travelling to me is asking the people you meet to share their customs with you, so the least you can do is learn to say please and thank you.  But for Jamie I guess that would be too bourgeois.His polemics are the hardest to take, mostly because his ideology is so anti-American and anti-Tony Blair (who he calls a war criminal).  Heâs got a great memory for what America has done, but when he is in China says nothing about the millions that Mao killed or the cultural genocide that is ongoing in Tibet.  In Georgia he talks about the âoppressionâ of the Russians in South Ossetia (who were moved in after Stalin exiled the indigenous people to Siberia) but nothing about the treatment of the Chechens. Itâs so biased that itâs laughable.To me what speaks most of his conceit is a fellow traveler named Danilo.  He travels with him on two occasions.  During both of these travels he comments on why traveling with Danilo is so rewarding.  What could that be?  Danilo is a strict vegetarian, so when they eat somewhere, if he thinks the food has meat in it, he gives his portion to Jamie.  Jamie thinks this is great. Never mentions that Danilo then has to go hungry. Yeah him. Except for a few places, that are off the beaten path, and therefore deserving of his mention, we get very little âcolorâ of most countries.Throughout we hear mention of a girlfriend (Emily, who plays in a string quartet) there is no mention of family.  I guess he was born from the froth of a wave that washed up on Englandâs shore.  I wonder if he realizes (or cares) how self-indulgent this whole book sounds?  The only good thing is that I didnât have to pay for it, got it free from the publisher (yeah me).Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C3MALJ4Q36KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620878313#wasThisHelpful","R1C3MALJ4Q36KY","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a comparative biography of Ulysses S Grant and Robert E Lee.  The author has written over fifty books on the Civil War and is the retired Virginia Tech Director of Programs for the Virginia Center for Civil War Studies as well as a Professor of History.  He has won two Pulitzer Prizes and three Jefferson Davis Prizes (for best Confederate History).  His book âLone Star Risingâ is considered the definitive one-volume book on the Texas War for Independence.After short biographies of both Lee and Grant, he discusses their times at the U S Military Academy (West Point) and their involvements in the Mexican War.  Grant served in the Quartermaster Corp but was constantly trying to get into a field command.  Lee spent his time with Winfield Scott as an adjutant and engineer.  Both were commended for their performance and promoted.Davis then discusses what both did in between their time in the Mexican War and the commencement of the Civil War.  Grant stayed in the service for a short time but settled down in Illinois to raise his family.  Grant was always looking for quick money schemes, some which worked out some that didnât.  Davis spends a good amount of time discussing the âlegendâ of Grantâs drinking habits, but says that he drank like most men in the service and out.Lee remained in the military, and at one time he served as the Superintendent at West Point (from 1852-1855).  When the war came, Lee was offered the command of the US Armies by Lincoln.  But when Virginia seceded, Lee felt his loyalty had to be to his home state first.  But Iâm not going to discuss their military commands in this review.There are long discussions on Lee and Grantâs views of slavery and States Rights and the hardships of command when away from family for so long.  For someone who has written so much on the Confederacy, Davis seems to favor Grant over Lee in his writing.  But Iâll leave that to the reader to determine by themselves.  Needless to say itâs a great read and amazingly informative.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VFDL82G9Q08G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4FSSFO#wasThisHelpful","R2VFDL82G9Q08G","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you know what the seventeen ârare earthâ elements are, do you care?  Well you should.  The first two are element 21 (scandium) which is used in mercury vapor and metal halide lamps. The second is element 36 (Yttruim)is used in YAG lasers, spark plugs and semiconductors.Many of the other fifteen are also used for lasers and specialized magnets that are used in cyclytrons and colliders. Though most of the ârare earth metals (REM)â are not all that rare, some like tantalum (73) Niobium (41) Molybdenum(42) Osmium(76) and Rhodium(45) are all necessary for modern cell phones, hybrid car batteries, and flat TV (high definition).  They could be made with other metals but they wouldnât be as efficient or last as long as they do.These metals were mined and purified in both Europe and America until the 1960s when there was a major find in China near the Mongolian border.  The Chinese realized how important these metals were and at first sold them at such low prices (supported by the Chinese government and many mined by former Nationalist soldiers, criminals and opponents of the government).  Because it is such an expensive process to purify these metals, once other developers were forced out of business, it became unprofitable to restart competing mines.Therefore at this time China controls the creation and sale of these metals and is the worldâs only major producer at this time.  There is a major deposit of these metals (conflict minerals) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, capital Kinshasa) but the Civil-War there has been under control of the rebels for most of the 21st Century.Because of the major costs in smelting these metals another supply has come onto the world market.  This market is based in places like India and Africa, where the rest of the world has created âdumpsâ for old computers, cell phones and the like.  The problem with this âalternate sourceâ is that itsâ major work force is children.  In the countries where these dumps are, itâs cheaper to hire children to break up the equipment and find the ârare metalsâ.This makes many children their family âbread winnerâ and they canât go to school because they have to work.  These metals can be poisonous like arsenic and antimony, in that they are dangerous over a period of time.  So these children are slowly poisoned as is the area around the dumps from the leaching of these metals into the ground waters and destroy the environment and local animals.  There is no existing international organization that is involved in this trade, so China will have the world over a barrel for many decades to come.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UUIU66CPGQZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616149728#wasThisHelpful","R3UUIU66CPGQZX","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the third book of Adlerâs âShoah Trilogyâ (after âThe Journeryâ and  âPanoramaâ).  Like Elie Wiesel, he is a holocaust survivor (of four different camps) and brings a unique prospective to his fiction.  One of his other books is about the âmodel campâ Theresienstadt (Terezin in Czech) where the character Arthur Landauâs grandmother was interned. Though the story was written right after the war, it wasnât published until 1989.The main character, Arthur Landau, returns to his native city (which seems like Prague) but later moves to the Metropolis (but seems like London) just after the war.  He looks to find out what happened to his parents.  He goes back to his fatherâs old haberdashery store which he finds boarded up.  Next door is a fruit stand run by a man who never got along with his family.  He is told by the old man that they were âdeportedâ during the war to Auschwitz and are most likely dead.While in his native city, he begins working on a book called the âSociology of Oppressed Peopleâ but canât find a publisher in the new socialist country.  He goes to work at a âmuseumâ that collects the property of the âpeopleâ who were sent to the concentration camps.  While at the museum he writes to a friend who emigrated before the war to the Metropolis.With his friendâs help he is able to emigrate.  There he meets his second wife Johanna (his first wife died in the Holocaust) and has two children (a boy and a girl).  He later is accepted into a circle of prewar intellectuals who had settled in the Metropolis and laud Arthur as the new Adam.Because the book is written in stream of consciousness, there are no chapters or breaks in the story.  This becomes problematic to the reader when trying to distinguish between Arthurâs dreams and musings about his time in the Camps and before the War.  Everything can get jumbled up in the story and is sometimes taken to the absurdist extreme when âpallbearersâ come to pick-up Arthur for his funeral, though they can see heâs not dead.As to the title of the book, Arthur sees things from the other side of a wall.  For me the wall represents Arthurâs experience in the Camps which canât be explained to people who werenât there.  Itâs a personal experience that other people canât be made to understand and therefore heâs always set apart from the rest of the world by this âWallâ.

"This is in actuality a collection of short stories by Michael Coffey.  There are eight stories in total of which I was only able to get through three before I decided to give up trying to figure out Coffeyâs style or purpose.In âMoon Over Quabbinâ we are listening to a person who used to live in one of the four towns that were submerged when the Quabbin River was dammed. The creation of the Quabbin Reservoir was done to create a water system for Eastern Massachusetts.  Most of the four towns were demolished and the cemeteries moved to higher ground.  But some of the stone structures were left and their tops can be seen when the water is low.  The woman in the story dreams of her child (who I expect is dead) who swims around their old town like a ghost.  I think.âThe Business of Naming Thingsâ is about a man who has spent his life doing âbrandingâ.  Everywhere he looks he sees things he has done.  He is going back to a development that he named that has decided to ârebrandâ themselves.  There he meets his son who has joined the community.  It all very ambivalent and non-directional.Now âSunlightâ is about an author/editor who has always wanted to meet a writer who is very âJD Salinger-ishâ.  One day he meets him but is too shy to talk to him.  One day many years later, he decides to meet the author and gets invited to his apartment.  The whole conversation he has with the author is Kafka-esque and to me seems self- deceptive (but, what do I know).So this is where I stopped.

Used it on my light covers and the dashboard of my 2002 Mitsubishi Montero and the covers were clear and the dashboard had a nice shine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2APRXH2S1FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYXM4DY#wasThisHelpful","R1L2APRXH2S1FO","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There has been a murder in Montmartre and Jack the Ripper is suspected.  Ever since the murders in London, the French Police and the Surete have worried that he would cross the Channel to Paris.  When the body (torso) of a young woman is found in a cesspool in Paris, their biggest fears seem to have come true.Inspector Lefevre is an up and coming young officer who is on top of all the newest technologies to catch criminals.  He is familiar with the biometrics of Chief Inspector Bertillon and the experimental use of fingerprinting to identify suspects.  Though the use of fingerprints in a criminal case has never been presented as prima facie evidence, in this case it may exculpate one person and prove another.Inspector Lefevre found a footprint at the cesspool cover and mad a cast of it.  It proved to be from a person of short stature.  Toulouse-Lautrec had used the dead woman as a model and a mistress, so he was suspected.  But the body shows signs of a vaginal hysterectomy and the limbs and head were severed by precise cuts.  Therefore a medical professional is also suspected as an accomplice.Through following the trail of those who committed the murder Lefevre is able to put together the information he needs to apprehend the murderer.  But there is one thing he didnât plan for and that was who the murderer was.  Well Done.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROC2E0OVHZ398/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5MQW2W#wasThisHelpful","ROC2E0OVHZ398","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
