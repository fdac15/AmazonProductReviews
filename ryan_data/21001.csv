"This is the 6th rug I have ordered and received from this collection.  The smaller ones I got for the hall and bedroom are a decent thickness so they're OK.  This one - not so much.  It is so thin that it is like they spray painted a design on top of the rubber which is the backing.  Had I known it was going to be a different thickness than the other ones, I never would have bought it.  Even at $120, I feel ripped off and not sure if it will go back.  Not happy at all with it.  On the plus side, the pattern is pretty.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GB8QAZS3IU5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EP05R9K#wasThisHelpful","R1GB8QAZS3IU5R","A35R32TA60XD57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35R32TA60XD57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so glad we got only a 2 pack of this soap!  We found it very drying and just did not work for us.  We used it as a shower soap and after that were glad we didn't attempt to use it on our face.  Way too harsh for our sensitive, dry skin.  What was also interesting was the film it left on the shower wall which had to be what was left on our skin as well.  Plus, it totally stripped our skin of any natural oils which is never a good thing.  We'll just stick to our Nivea moisturizing body wash.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR06Q98PIYWU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004D267TY#wasThisHelpful","RR06Q98PIYWU8","A35R32TA60XD57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35R32TA60XD57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent food and I loved serving it to Emma.  However, I tried on 2 separate occasions to give it to her from 2 different cases and we got a bad skin reaction both times.  I was puzzled to say the least because she enjoys several other flavors of Weruva without problems.  I stopped giving her this and continued on with the other flavors she loves which were mostly chicken breast varieties.  Then I tried the double dip flavor and we got the same reaction.  I had to figure this out!  I stopped giving her that one too and knew it couldn't be the beef because she loves the steak frites without any problems.  I finally compared the label to the other chicken flavors and the mystery was solved.  She seems to be allergic the the dark meat chicken in this food.  Since I have stopped giving her this and the double dip, we haven't any skin reactions again.  I still give it 5 stars because I know that most cats are not like my little hot house orchid.  An excellent food from a company I trust.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XR6U5R9GDVL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHTW58O#wasThisHelpful","R1XR6U5R9GDVL1","A35R32TA60XD57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35R32TA60XD57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just got the 9x12 sage/ivory rug today and are both extremely pleased.  It is a beautiful rug and within hours was laying flat and looking gorgeous.  It covers the area in our living room we wanted it to and makes it look more than a little elegant.  We found the colors to be accurate and didn't find any excessive odors at all.  Totally pleased.  I just ordered the matching runner for the hall! We find this rug plush and nicely weighted to stay in place on our hardwood floor.  It is also perfectly square on the ends and matched the wood slats on our floor which is wonderful!  These prices are unbeatable for this quality rug.UPDATE: 8-14 We had ordered the runner to match this rug and it came yesterday.  When we went to put it in the hall, we noticed the corners were frayed.  I do not feel like worrying about it being a continuous battle to keep it together so it is going back.  The sad part is that when we looked at the 9x13' rug, the corners are fraying on it too.  One is worse than the other 2 and one is somewhere in the middle but none of them look secure.  I am puzzled as to what to do with it at this point. I can't believe we missed seeing that when we put it down.  I guess because it is basically in the corners of the room, we didn't notice.  I really don't want to have to hassle with sending this big, heavy thing back but I don't want to have this problem with it either.  Not sure what we will do.  Has anyone else had this with theirs???","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X6GVGSLYTRVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00465SMQE#wasThisHelpful","R1X6GVGSLYTRVQ","A35R32TA60XD57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35R32TA60XD57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disappointed with the larger size cans of this food.  I have been using the small cans with great success with my baby, Emma, without any problems.  I thought I would try to save some money by getting 2 servings out of one can for a better deal.  NOT.  When I opened the can, all I could see was broth.  I had to dig through to get even one serving of meat.  Looks like they used the same amount of meat as the 3 ounce cans and just added more liquid.  Will not be getting this size again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZ1ZJD3VTERX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TM70WY#wasThisHelpful","R2FZ1ZJD3VTERX","A35R32TA60XD57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35R32TA60XD57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We usually drink high test coffee.  Still, it is nice to have some decaf on hand for those times later in the day when you feel like  a cup of good coffee.  Other decafs tasted washed out to us and weak which we didn't care for.  This one meets our criteria with full body and a great price.

"I was a little afraid to try another new coffee because it seems like lately I have been striking out.  Anyway, am SO glad we gave this a try.  My husband and I are both very particular about just about everything and our coffee is not an exception.  This tastes like something you would be served in one of the finest coffee shops around.  Incredibly full and flavorful without ANY bitterness.  Just full and round.  Starts out creamy and ends with a nice tangy finish.  Wonderful!  Just ordered some on S&S of this one and the midtown as well.  We have found our new morning java.  If you are looking for a coffee such as I have described, look no further.UPDATE: As we loved the swingin bold, we decided to try the midtown and decaf as well.  Midtown was a kind of boring coffee with not much going on for us.  The decaf was the worst coffee we have tried just about anywhere.  It was like a bitter cup of hot water with no coffee flavor to balance it.  Threw the whole box out...it was that bad.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34AW3X6N3F830/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVT3LVM#wasThisHelpful","R34AW3X6N3F830","A35R32TA60XD57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35R32TA60XD57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Actually I love them. Except for the one sock where the toe seam came apart after wearing them twice. Otherwise they are what I have looked for and could not find anywhere. The other pairs are fine and I don't want to go through the trouble of returning/replacing all 4 pair for one sock. Although I would really like to have 4 complete pair.The expected delivery date was disappointing. But the actual delivery date was awesome. It came much quicker than stated.The non stick at the bottom does not take away from the feel of the sock.

"It gives an elegant look to my floor. There is a member of this household who rarely notices anything. (some of you can relate to this I'm sure) First thing in the door was ""WOW! That really looks nice. It makes a difference."" That in itself is a great endorsement.The top is metal. The adjustable grating just under the ""scroll"" top is plastic. I do not have a problem with this. I can't see how this would be a problem unless a high heel stepped on it while the vent was closed. If that happened it wouldn't matter if it was plastic or metal the heel would be broken and someone might very well have a twisted ankle. We women are smart enough to step over.I do walk on it with bare feet, sandals, and tennis shoes. No problem. Even the bigger foot in the house walks on it.

"Surviving for US is the debut novel from Lauren Nicole. This is a beautiful love story about taking chances and opening your heart up to love again.Angie was hurt badly by her high school sweetheart and she doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be able to fall in love or trust again. All that changed when she met Chase through a mutual friend. Chase is beyond gorgeous and sweet. Chase was drawn to Angie immediately recognizing her as his neighbor when he was in high school. He could tell he had his work cut out for him for her to even allow him in as a friend. Having a girlfriend would be hard for him since he is leaving to go back to school for his military training as a Marine. Soon Angie and Chase are unable to fight the feelings they have for each other and they become so much more. Leaving her was painful and harder than he expected. Chase and Angie have so much love, but will that be enough for their relationship to survive the challenges it faces?I loved this book because of all the ‚Äúfeels‚Äù it evokes. I laughed and cried right along with the characters. I loved the secondary characters, Jenn and Chris, as much as I did Angie and Chase.

She wants to let go of all the stress and burden of being Alexandria. She becomes ""Charli"" who she sees as the opposite of herself. Charli is fun and carefree. Charli  meets a mysterious, handsome stranger, Nox, who she agreed to be with for a week. Their week together is smoking hot!! They made rules to not share any personal information and after the week, it's over. The heart doesn't always get the memo.Fast forward 6 weeks and Alex is faced with life changing decisions. Will breaking free from her family bring her freedom or only cause her to betray herself even more?Betrayal is hot, sexy and intriguing! You will be begging for more.

"Slaying the Dragon is the second book and the conclusion to the Deception Duet. Let me tell you this was rightly named the Deception Duet because this book keeps you glued to the pages wondering just who is deceiving who. From page-one my heart began to race and my blood pressure was rising with all that begins to unfold for Mackenzie and Tyler.Slaying the Dragon is filled with so much emotion and tension, both sexual and otherwise.

"The Way We Fall is the first book in the Story of Us series. It was such an emotional book.  I fell in love with this book from page one and could not stop reading. The characters were real, raw and emotional.  This isn't a feel good mushy hearts and flowers romance.  Yes there is love and romance, but there is also pain and tragedy.  Be ready to face some emotionally charged topics that you will feel with all your heart.  Hours after finishing this book I am still trying to absorb all that happened.The Way We Break is the second book in the Story of Us series. I don't even know what to say other than I am completely blown away with this book.  Thinking about this story has tears in my eyes as I write this review.  The emotions are so real and so raw.  So many questions are answered and we see just how much both love and lies can tear people apart and bring others together. It has never been more clear to me how much Houston loves Rory, as you will see, when he pulls out all the stops to bring her happiness and gain her forgiveness. The end of this book left me wondering how much more can any one person take.  I anxiously await the final book, The Way We Rise.  Cassia Leo never fails to deliver.The Way We Rise is the final book in the Story of Us series. I could not have asked for a more perfect ending to Houston and Rory's story. I have to say that my heart almost stopped several times while reading this book. I cried tears of sadness and tears of joy. This is an emotional ride that will stay with me for a long time.What I loved about this book is that you can feel the heart and soul of each of the characters. Houston proves that he is a man among men and does everything in his power to prove his love to Rory, even when what he has to do wasn't what I wanted at the time.Rory was so lost and hurt that she didn't know which way was up. Her struggle to find herself, forgive herself, Houston, her father, and Hallie tore at my heart. Her relationship with Kenny, her best friend, it's one that anyone would be lucky to have.There's so much I want to say but I don't want to give any spoilers. The Way We Rise is a must read that you're sure to love!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IJGV063AFAEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IPOJQQ#wasThisHelpful","R3IJGV063AFAEN","A163XZU3HM4EHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A163XZU3HM4EHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Madame X absolute blew me away.  It was everything I thought it would be but then again not what I expected.  This story will bind you to the pages and keep you reading until you finish.  My heart was broken for Madame X and all that she has endured and lost. What would you do if you had no memory of your past, not even your name.  Madame X on the outside appears to have it all.  She lives in a luxury condo that is more like a prison.  She works for Caleb, teaching the spoiled and privileged rich boys how to become respected men.  No she isn‚Äôt a call girl and doesn‚Äôt have sex with these men.  Caleb would never allow it.  He tells her over and over ‚ÄúYou belong to me.‚Äù Caleb found and saved her on that fateful day 6 years ago and she is loyal to him. He takes what he wants and she gives it to him. There are so many facets to this story that I don‚Äôt even know where to begin or what to say.  Along comes Logan who completely takes Madame X by surprise and she has unexpected feelings for him. Fear keeps her from completely giving in to the feelings that were evoked just by the sight of Logan. This book is full of many twists and turns, some of which I did not see coming.  I think there is so much more to all the characters in this story and I cannot wait to discover each and every thing that is to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L57O5DO11KQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V478172#wasThisHelpful","R3L57O5DO11KQK","A163XZU3HM4EHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A163XZU3HM4EHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I did a little happy dance when I read this book.  I fell in love with Adam when he was with Claire, but I loved Chris too and I knew it wasn't meant to be for Adam and Claire.  I was so happy to get to find out what happened in Adam's life and to see his HEA. Ripped is Adam and Lindsey's story.  This book was beyond funny, sexy and full of love.  So many times I had tears in my eyes from laughing and overall emotion. There are so many quotes and jokes I highlighted in this book that I had to read to my husband. I will admit that I was not a fan of Lindsey in the early books, but she definitely redeemed herself in my eyes. She is a strong and loving wife and mother. There were so many life lessons in this book that will make you love them all even more.

"The Seduction of Alex Parker is a book that I could not put down. I absolutely love everything Sani Lynn and this was no exception. If you love Connor and Ellery Black in the Forever Series, then you will love Alex Parker and Emerson James. This is a standalone novel.Alex Parker is the sexy as sin billionaire who had the world at his feet, but he was very arrogant and all about control. That control was soon hard to keep when his friend's sister came into his life. A favor for a friend changed him forever. This beautiful, defiant, sexy, sassy mouth girl gave him a run for his money.Emerson was always on the go never staying in one place too long. After the tragic death of her parents and twin sister, Emerson spent eight years on the go until she was forced to come home to California. Alex Parker opened his home to her but she wasn't sure if she could deal with his arrogant bossy ways. Only she wasn't able to control how he made her feel again.I loved the banter between Alex and Emerson. When they connect it is unbelievable. I wanted to scream at them because they are both so stubborn. I also love how they both were just what the other needed only they didn't know it. You will love all the sassy, fiery, tender and frustrating moments and will want more because it is just that perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SALJ3WUZE2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ASXL52#wasThisHelpful","R6SALJ3WUZE2A","A163XZU3HM4EHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A163XZU3HM4EHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sinful Desire is book 2 in the Sinful Nights series by Lauren Blakely. This book has it in spades! If you want a hot alpha male ‚Äì check! Submissive yet successful confident woman ‚Äì check! Explosion in the bedroom, wall, couch, table, car or whatever other surface you can think of, then- double check!!Ryan Sloan and Sophie Winston had an immediate attraction when they met outside the police precinct in Las Vegas. The pavement was melting the minute they spoke. Mr. dirty talking always  in control has no control over his feelings for Sophie. This successful wealthy woman was made to submit to him in the bedroom. I will never be able to look at or think of green ties and peaches the same again.So I have established that this has some hot and sexy, I need a cold shower scenes, but it also has tender moments and a captivating story line that keeps you turning the pages. This book is the continuation of the Sloan family's tragic past and the aftermath of their father's murder. Ryan wants to believe that his mom isn't  responsible for his father's murder and has stood by her for 18 years. The investigation is reopened and there seems to be more questions than answers. Hold on to your hat because the drama and mystery only gets bigger with the bombshell that is dropped at the end of this book. I definitely need Sinful Longing now to see how this plays out. Not to mention another hot Sloan brother!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q3OD55TN5716/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108NTFEK#wasThisHelpful","R2Q3OD55TN5716","A163XZU3HM4EHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A163XZU3HM4EHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Way We Rise is the final book in the Story of Us series. I could not have asked for a more perfect ending to Houston and Rory's story. I have to say that my heart almost stopped several times while reading this book. I cried tears of sadness and tears of joy. This is an emotional ride that will stay with me for a long time.What I loved about this book is that you can feel the heart and soul of each of the characters. Houston proves that he is a man among men and does everything in his power to prove his love to Rory, even when what he has to do wasn't what I wanted at the time.Rory was so lost and hurt that she didn't know which way was up. Her struggle to find herself, forgive herself, Houston, her father, and Hallie tore at my heart. Her relationship with Kenny, her best friend, it's one that anyone would be lucky to have.There's so much I want to say but I don't want to give any spoilers.

"His Proposed Deal is another fantastic book by Sandi Lynn. This book has it all! HOT rich playboy (Max), beautiful girl pursuing her dreams (Emma), instant attraction, hot sex, pain, heartbreak, love and devotion. All would be well and good, but love and unexpected surprises were never supposed to be part of the deal. Sandi Lynn does an amazing job bringing this story together and making you both love and hate Max. This book has both panty melting sex and deep emotional loving moments that will make you swoon. Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down. His Proposed Deal is a 5 star read for me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38Y0QEJ32M3ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3N8MF8#wasThisHelpful","R38Y0QEJ32M3ZP","A163XZU3HM4EHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A163XZU3HM4EHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tempting BAD was‚Ä¶ Wow, just wow! I can't begin to tell you how much I loved this book. This story will literally rip your heart out, stomp on it, start to heal it, and then rip it out again, only to put it back together better than it's ever been. If you want emotion you've got it. If you want hot as hell sex, then you've most definitely got it. If you want to see two broken halves become whole, then jump in and devour this book.

"This was my first book by Devon Hartford and it won't be my last. Stepbrother Obsessed was sexy, funny and emotional. This book touched on many subjects not just the ""taboo"" stepbrother/stepsister relationship but also bullying, reducing your carbon footprint and acceptance of others as they are and not how they look. I fell for Dante in spite of his cocky self assured attitude. I love that Skye wasn't this perfect beauty queen, but was perfect in Dante's eyes. Their relationship is a constant uphill battle that is not easy. I was frustrated at times, but it made me want to read even more. I hope to read more about Skye and Dante in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5Y3852EBI31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNOI67W#wasThisHelpful","R2M5Y3852EBI31","A163XZU3HM4EHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A163XZU3HM4EHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved this book.  I was immediately pulled in to the story and could feel the weight of the past and pain that Kayla keeps buried inside. Even after leaving New York and running for almost 5 years, she can't run from the past that haunts her. She begins to feel again when she meets a hot British guy at a club.  Kayla went out to the club to forget that tragic day and he was just the ticket to helping her forget. Only he too had something that weighed heavy on his heart.I love the journey that HM Ward and Stacey Mosteller take us on of learning to trust, heal and love again.  This was such a beautiful love story that will have you laughing and crying, but it is so worth it! I did not want to put this book down.  I could read about Oliver, our Hot British guy, and Kayla his American girl all day long.I highly recommend this book.

"This is a great deal for so many amazing books!! I read My First, My Last by Lacey Silks and it blew me away! It was more than worth the price of the entire collection. Here is my review of My First, My Last.This is a beautiful story about two people who are destined to be together even after being apart for 20 years. Mia and Adrian were each others first loves when they were only 15 years old. They met at her aunts when she visited Vienna from Canada in the summers. They were separated by distance yet never completely got over the other.Mia was stunned when she was out with friends and saw him at the bar in Canada. He was gorgeous and took her breath away. After 20 years he still caused feelings to stir inside her.Mia is divorced with two children. She still has a friendly relationship with her ex husband, Dan, for the sake of the children. This makes it difficult for her to let go and not feel guilty for her feelings for Adrain, even tho Dan is the one who cheated on her. Mia feels like she was a failure at marriage and doesn't want to fail again.Adrain has never married because no one could compare to his love for Mia. He is still madly in love with her and will stop at nothing to show her how worthy she is.This book is so full of love and emotions. I laughed and cried like a baby. This book was well worth all the tears. It will make you believe in destiny and sole mates.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4KODA792CXO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBC3IBA#wasThisHelpful","R4KODA792CXO5","A163XZU3HM4EHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A163XZU3HM4EHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This topic has always been fascinating to me. People say so much more then they realize without speaking a word but just through their body language. Many of us personally dont realize that we ourselves say so much more to others by the way they read our body language when our words may not  even be spoken. This book gave me better insight as to what the signs mean and how to read futher into a persons by their body language. I think it was also interesting how these body language cues mean different things in different cultures. After reading this book it helped me get a better understanding for myself on how I send off different signs just by the use of my body language that I didnt realize.

"This light bulb has a great warm white color which makes it seem brighter than it really is. I beleive the statement that this 4 watt bulb seems like a 45 watt bulb due to this warm white tone it lets off. I like how this bulb doesnt get hot like my other bulbs do which make me nervous around kids who like to touch bright things. I like how this uses less electricity. I can see how the use of many of these in your house would be great especially during the summer  because it would keep the rooms cooler than ordinary bulbs.

"I really like these silicone bottles! The are the perfect size to use for my Shampoo, conditioner, and lotion for when I travel as you are only allowed to carry-on 3 oz bottles of any liquid. I dont like checking a bag so this is perfect for that use. The caps stay secure and closed to prevent spilling on my clothes and the liquid is easy to dispense due to its soft squeezable material. The bottles have a great twistable label which are great to differentiate each liquid I have in the bottle and can later change it to something else without having to put a new label on it, alls you need to do is twist the top to the correct labeled content and you're good to go!

"I used these wraps as soon as I received them as I wanted to go to the beach but felt a little thick in the middle. After using the wrap for the first time I noticed a drastic difference in my mid-section. I was pleasantly surprised as I was a skeptic before trying it. Not that I didnt believe that it would work, I was just unfamiliar with the product nor how it worked. The second application on, I did I used it  in conjunction with the Cellulite Gel and it showed me even greater results than the first time! Im not sure if it was because of the added gel or if my body just reacted better to the second application but either way it was impressive as the results I got. Im glad I took photos of the before and after as it is great to show how effective it was on me. This was after 4 treatments that the results are seen losing 6 inches!

"I used this product along with the Lipo Body wraps and was immediately impressed with the results I saw. It left my skin feeling smooth and softer than ever. It didnt have a harsh smell as other gels do and it doesnt leave a residue on your skin unlike other gels I have heard of friends using. I havent used it without the wraps yet but I am sure you can.

"I had always heard about these creams and gels that help reduce cellulite. To be honest I never believed that any of them would work. I was skeptical until I tried this product. It actually has worked for me and has shown a noticable difference in my legs where I once saw extremely noticable cellulite and now it has begun to fade. My husband even mentioned how nice my legs are looking and I didnt tell him that I was using this product. It doesn't smell funny or leave an oily feeling on my skin.

"This wine chiller has been great for when I have company over. It allows me to leave wine out on table rather than have to keep putting back into fridge preventing my guests from helping themselves to another glass when they are ready. It does a great job at keeping the wine cold for a long period of time and preventing the need for a large ice bucket. It has been helpful to have when I haev cookouts and want to keep wine outside with the guests. Even with the hot summer weather here in Florida it still is able to keep the wine at a nice chilled temperature for a few hours.

"These chill cubes are great for when I go to the beach with a drink. It keeps my beverage cold a lot longer than the average ice cube and it is great because it doesnt water down my drink. I also love using these in my wine! I love to drink my red wine cold but hate to have it watered down by ice cubes. This has been a great alternative to prevent this but still be able to enjoy my wine at the perfect temperature. They freeze really fast so they can be ready for your next drink you need chilled in no time. I like the little sack it comes with to store them neatly in your freezer.

"I wanted to read The Cuckoo's Calling solely because it was J.K. Rowling. I am a ridiculous fan of her work, her life story, ‚Äãand the Harry Potter series, on which, unlike most lucky readers, I did not get my hands until very recently (on book #5 now and going strong). This book is an entirely different genre and it's indeed easier to imagine an ex-military ex-cop ex-PI turned male author - perhaps by the name of Robert Galbraith - dreamed this up than the heart-warming fantasy fiction writer we know and love as Ms. Rowling.But alas, Rowling has many tales to spin, and I have to say, I loved this tale too. I generally go into books by the author and not by the book description, so I knew very little about the book. Had I read that it was about a super model who allegedly commits suicide and a grieving brother hires a PI to investigate it as a possible murder, I would have moved right on. I don't do murder mysteries, that's my mother-in-law's world. But I loved it.SPOILER ALERT - One burning question that I have if you've already read the book is this: Why did John Bristow hire the detective if the truth was as it was? Why would he benefit from the truth, or was he hoping for a different outcome, was he framing another or just pushing his luck for fun? And what clue was the initial giveaway for Strike?As for the characters: I liked Cormoran Strike alright. He's your typical ex-military PI, with a terrible war injury and a complex and self-destructive love life, and of course, he's a damn good detective to boot. Together with Robin, his ""temp"" secretary, they make such a fun match as they follow lead after lead to solving the mystery. The book takes you into the lives of the rich and famous: Guy Some, the gay fashion designer, Ciara Porter, the other supermodel, the Bristow family: a rich spoiled family with dark secrets and terrible relations toward one another, the boyfriend - drug-addict, spoiled, hungry for real love, too famous to care, too unstable to be likable, and more.The one theme that struck me is how assumptions can turn into reality when terrible things happen to those who are full of self-destructive habits. How easy is it so conclude that ""Sure he killed himself. You could see it coming! He was depressed, an alcoholic and often talked of suicide. It all makes sense!"" And yet, not every soul caught in the cycle of self-destruction is interested in ending his or her own life, and not all such deaths are ""accidents"" waiting to happen.While I have no real interest in the lives of rich and famous, I was drawn to the book because I am curious about the many facets of the author's skills. This is not exactly a ""PG"" or family friendly book. There is much cursing, much foul language, and sexual content that is hard to image from the author of Harry Potter, and that's not easy to do. This speaks to the versatile skills of the writer, and how she can truly put herself in the shoes of characters from all walks of life, and speak their language, express their pains and desires, and take us into their world. She is a master storytelling, and it shows in every unfolding of The Cuckoo's Calling. While I am not in a hurry to do so, I'll probably pick up the next in the series of Cormoran Strike, but first, I really do need to finish the Harry Potter series, or risk being the absolute last person on earth to do so!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q57VV6528GKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316206857#wasThisHelpful","R3Q57VV6528GKG","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received the Logitech Illuminated Living-Room Wireless Keyboard K830 for the purpose of driving a 2009 Mac Mini, which I use as an HTPC connected to my television.  In this regard, this keyboard performs well.  The integrated mouse pad and keyboard make it easy to drive web-based  video on-demand services from across the room (mainly for those that do not support Chromecast yet).  The only negative I had with it is that I could not get bluetooth connectivity to work with my Mac Mini.  I was able to get the keyboard working with bluetooth to a Macbook Pro just fine, so either my Mac Mini had an issue or it was too old/not running the proper OS to connect with the keyboard.  I used the included Unifying receiver to attach with my Mac Mini and connected that way and have had no issue with connectivity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUYJWMCK26PPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOPVSKW#wasThisHelpful","RUYJWMCK26PPQ","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love this convertible car seat, but not for a newborn. The information does say for an infant between 9 pounds and 65 pounds, and while it is safe for a 9 pound infant I‚Äôd recommend having an infant car seat for the first couple of months since it's so much easier to take the baby out of the car without having to wake him or her up. Our baby is now 12 pounds and it although he fits in this car seat and it is safe for him, it's easier to take him out of the car while he's in his infant car seat. When he gains a couple more pounds we'll be using this car seat and no longer use the infant car seat.We had our 6-month-old niece in this Maxi Cosi car seat and she fits in it well, and she was very comfortable. She went right to sleep during the drive.  I know our baby will be really comfortable and happy in this car seat in a month or two.I like that this car seat is both front facing and rear facing. Its versatility will allow us to use this for years! The black color is great for hiding any future stains that are sure to occur, and the material is firm yet soft to the touch, making it extremely comfortable as well as supportive.Although the car seat is huge (compared to an infant car seat) it fits perfectly fine in our Toyota Prius. It does not fit in the middle seat position but fits nicely on the left and/or right side rear passenger. It's a pretty easy installation, we did take it to the local police station for the car seat safety check and had no corrections or issues with the seat or its installation.It‚Äôs a high-quality car seat with a luxurious look and feel. The removable cup holder on the side is fantastic! The car seat also has a really nice removable body pillow and removable side storage pocket. The cover is also removable and it‚Äôs washing machine safe, so it‚Äôs easy to clean.With no complaints and only positive experiences with it, I give this beautiful  Black Maxi-Cosi Vello 65 Convertible Car Seat 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9JNY0R2LBTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU9CKTG#wasThisHelpful","R1H9JNY0R2LBTC","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We absolutely LOVE this Burton suitcase. The color that we ordered through Amazon is no longer showing up on the product page here but I've attached pictures. My husband had picked the Snow Print but I picked this gorgeous colorful version instead, and I love it.First off, the quality is nice. The fabric, the wheels, the handle, the zippers, the lining, the colors, everything is HIGH QUALITY. This speaks to the durability and reliability over time and I am very pleased with how Burton designed and made this suitcase.The size is small. I have taken much larger carry-ons on the airplanes. We took this to South Korea from the US this past week and it's done very well. This is my husband's main suitcase, but he is a light packer. There is a main compartment, and the open flap also has a lining with the zipper where you can put smaller items. The main compartment also has a zipper that closes and protects it. There are no dividers in the main compartment.The suitcase is so compact and so nice, you can just throw it up on the overhead compartment on the airplane, it takes up much less room than average roll-ons. It's easy to navigate the airports and train stations with it, and it's perfect for short or long getaways depending on how efficient a packer you are. If you want some packing tips, check out my YouTube videos on packing under my full name.Love this Burton Roller and highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WS6DPDAG07US/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IABZUN8#wasThisHelpful","R1WS6DPDAG07US","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review contains SPOILERS. You've been warned! :)This book moved me so much: old age, loss, regrets, pain, terminal illness, loneliness, suicide, women in a ""man's workplace"", and a vile teenager (I could have done without David but I guess we need all the characters!). I liked Queenie Hennessy but I can't say that I loved her. I wanted to. The story starts in a hospice and it ends there. The mystery of Harold Fry was new to me as I had not read the other book, ""The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry"", Rachel Joyce's earlier book. I can't say that I'm drawn to reading it either.The writing is beautiful, I love how the author writes out the waltz scenes and the stunning way she describes Queenie's sea garden. I could almost see Queenie working there. The story is told from the perspective of Queenie and the timeline moves from the present time at the hospice to the past, all the way back to Queenie's childhood and then to the more recent past when she worked at the Brewery and fell in love with Harold Fry but did absolutely nothing about it. But that is not half as annoying as the vile teenage son of Harold Fry, David, a good-for-nothing teenager that Queenie is happy to let walk all over her. I just could not get onboard with the dynamics between David, Harold and Queenie. I  like to think my character is strong and has choices and exercises them, but Queenie just kept acting dumb and dumber, and I could not feel sympathy for her.One of the themes this author explores is one we may just know something about: how hard it is to tell the truth after the first lie and then the second one and then a mountain of lies, because you just couldn't bring yourself to tell the truth after that first one. Such is the dilemma of Queenie toward Harold.I listened to this book on audio, borrowed from the library, and it was a wonderfully entertaining listen, but I was impatient. I listened at 1.25x or 1.5x the speed. I wanted to keep moving forward. What secret had she kept for 20 years? And in the end, not only did I guess the secret (no, that never happens to me!!!), I also didn't find it to be intriguing enough. Argh. I do feel bad for Queenie and this was a stunningly written book, but my dislike of David was too much. If he was supposed to be the villain, at least then I knew I was supposed to dislike him, but there is no way I had any sympathy for that vile teenager.The best passages in the book are the dances, the drives with Harold Fry, the sea garden and the scenes at the hospice. They are bittersweet and lovely and full of joy.My favorite twist was learning that Queenie had imagined the help she was getting with her letters. But it made sense. It was better that way. Did Harold Fry find out about the secret after all? Could he read her shorthand? Was there anything else to give it away? I don't know. I never will. I am however glad to have read the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZJBN2FA7A16V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812996674#wasThisHelpful","R1ZJBN2FA7A16V","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: I received a free copy of Bob Pritchett's book, Start Next Now, and here is my honest product review.From the description: ""This fast-paced book provides you with an actual plan to start achieving your goal before you even finish reading."" So it's a quick read, motivational to light a fire under you and to get you going, to make you feel responsible for your life and your dreams, and to give you pointers here and there about the next steps in your education, career, or business, but the term ""an actual plan"" is an exaggeration.It's a quick read, maybe 40 minutes and the author is a savvy businessman who knows a lot about running a business, starting from scratch and not attaching value to the usual stuff that misdirects those of us in search of something more than just a job and a salary. He has some extremely good points: About questioning the value of further education, an MBA, or a big name school, about setting yourself apart whether in an interview or in an office conversation and about staying motivated and giving up watching TV or doing stuff that wastes your time, and those are all very good pointers.The main problem is that there are no step-by-step how-to on figuring out your passion or starting a business or getting a raise other than the cursory details and the book is so short, it just doesn't have the capacity to go into any level of detail as it's tackling way too many subjects at once.A lot of the concepts, while I agree 100%, are the same old motivational and inspirational words and phrases you hear from any successful business person. I had hoped for some originality, but I did not come away with any.The main issue I see here is me: I am not the ideal target reader for this book, as I felt I knew a lot of what was in here. If you are completely new to the idea of making a change in your life, getting unstuck, pursuing your goals, listening to your heart, doing the right thing without asking for permission, etc. and don't need to go into any depth on any given topic, if you need a quick boost and inspiration to get started down the right path or at least, start moving away from the wrong thing, it can be a good read. this may very well serve as a great resource.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35BDSGL44LMZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1577996453#wasThisHelpful","R35BDSGL44LMZM","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gifted this L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition to my mom. She had insisted that she knew exactly what she wanted. She's in her early 60s and has beautiful skin, but the wrinkles have appeared and so I got it for her. She hasn't stopped talking about it. She loves this cream so much, and I also went ahead and bought one for myself.While my mom hasn't been the fanatic I am about her skin, she is still seeing nice benefits from the cream especially for the price. For me, I have used $60 or even $90 face creams that promise you the world, and only take your money. I've also used cheap skincare and sworn it off, but I do trust L'Oreal and other brands that have been around for decades and have done tons of scientific research on their formula and are providing these wonderful creams at decent prices.I use the cream after I take off all my makeup and tone my face. I use it over my face and neck. I also use it on airplanes because it is super hydrating on dry airplanes, and recovery for your skin is essential if you fly a lot. I haven't used it during the day - it's thicker than I would like for a daily moisturizer and no SPF, but I'm sure you could if you are staying indoors all day.Fantastic skincare that I plan to continue using for the foreseeable future.

"Friendly warning: My review may contain spoilers so beware if you haven't read the book and are sensitive to such things.I read After You before its prequel, Me before You, and while I wish I had read them in the right order, I gained an interesting perspective reading them in reverse. This was the third book in the last month that I have read by Jojo Moyes, and it's my least favorite and I still loved it. The Girl You Left Behind is my true favorite and After You my second favorite, even though I was so fed up with Lily, the spoiled little brat, but alas, annoying characters are part of a great story.I was far more attuned to the audio version and the reader's voice in After You that it took me a few hours into the book to warm up to this female version of Louisa Clarke, but warm up I did, and I stayed up late, laying on the carpet, stretching my limbs and listening to the final hours of the story of Louisa Clarke and Will Trainer.  It was truly a lovely story, even if you had to tolerate way too much of Patrick (aka, running man! yikes!) and too little of the love story between Louisa and Will - it really didn't come into play until the latter part of the book, and it ended almost before it started.Jojo Moyes grapples with some complex themes, the biggest one the choice of self-assisted suicides for those terminally ill and suffering, and whether this is something their families and loved ones and the right 'authorities' should allow or deny. I learned quite a bit about the limited life of quadriplegics and admired Louisa's determination to help Will find a thread of hope in the living side. And yet I couldn't help but see Will's side of life in this way versus life the way he had known it, and despite the love that had grown in his heart, he couldn't bear the thought of living this way. Dying looked more appealing than living in his condition, and that made this book a terribly sad story to read.I wasn't crazy about the break in the choice of narrators especially since NONE of them included Will. One chapter was by Trina the sister, another by Nathan the medical care provider and another by Mrs. Trainer and yet another by Mr. Trainer, but mainly we saw the world through third-person limited view of Louisa Clark, but this did afford you the 360 view into the tragic lives of those affected by such awful twists in fate.Overall, I LOVE love LOVE this author. Jojo Moyes is funny, smart, both heart-wrenching and heart-warming, and draws up characters and circumstances and lives so real that you feel you are there with them, watching them go through their conflict and triumphs, and being as real as your own breathing! Plus I'm now into my modern English female novelists phase, so I'll be reading more of her work.What would you do if you were a 35-year old most successful, admirable, adventurous, physical, wealthy and life-hungry person and an accident took all that away from you, leaving you at the mercy and burden of others to take care of you, to see to your every need and to go through hell with you. What if you knew that not only you won't be getting better, but you will actually be getting worse, with frequent bouts of pneumonia and various infections, and a very good chance of some bacteria or virus taking over at anytime and declaring you finished. Just like that. Maybe a part of you might choose a dignified way of dying, on your terms, on your chosen day and hour, with all who love you surrounding you.This is a book that shows us to respect the choice and decisions of those who are most affected by their own affliction, and to honor the choice of life or death, whatever their wish may be, even if our own selfish desires would rather see the suffering person among the living. It's a vastly complex and yet simple theme and Jojo Moyes does a brilliant job of exploring it to its very core.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJPY561ELZDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143124544#wasThisHelpful","R3AJPY561ELZDK","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do a lot of yoga and my yoga teacher out in Hawaii swears by the Smelly Washer brand. I'm brand new to this. I got two kinds, one is a regular one and another is this Towel Cleaner version.It is in powder form and it is pretty strong. The label warns that if you put new clothes, the colors will fade. I threw all my yoga towels and other regular towels in but I missed a brown top in there too. It wasn't new and it did not fade one bit. In fact, none of my towels, even the pink one, suffered from any loss of color.The bad sweat smell is gone now, and your towels smell of absolutely nothing. :) It's great for the bad smell to be gone but I wish there was some kind of scent to give to the freshly cleaned laundry. Anyway, that was not the #1 priority and the stuff works. I'm partial to liquid detergents but we used the powder and the results are satisfactory.I would not use this powder with a regular load of laundry. It's targeted for towels only.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32HYF80YNFHL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032TW6I0#wasThisHelpful","R32HYF80YNFHL9","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We LOVE this brilliant, bendy silicon muffin baking pan!My husband wanted to make some egg muffins - which turned out divine with cheese and turkey bacon - and if you are on weight watchers, only 2 points plus! So we ordered this bright red and shiny silicon muffin pan and we LOVE It.You just place them right onto the pan, and you do need to place the pan on a baking tray as it's not a firm object, so it needs to be stabilized‚Äã.Biggest plus: The muffins do NOT stick to the bottom of the muffin pan cup. Brilliant. And you don't need wrapping. They just come right off!Size: You have 12 muffin cups! Plenty to give you left overs!We love the color. It's a happy color to use in your kitchen.Super easy to clean out with soapy water and rinse.

"Disclaimer: I received a free Thief Essential Oil Blend and here is my honest product review.This is the 4th bottle of Prime Cosmetics product that I'm reviewing and this is my least favorite. By saying that, I'm only referring to my personal preference in smell. I know that it has appealed to a lot of buyers from their reviews, and the blend of oils may appeal to you too. It's just a bit too spicy for me. I have used it in a bath and in an essential oil diffuser and the smell is okay but nothing that soothes or calms or even energizes or invigorates. It's not doing anything for me. But many find it to be a ""delightful combination"" so you  may want to give it a go.The bottle is still lovely and the quality of the oils in this product is reasonably good, so nothing to fuss about there. Just the smell is not doing it for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GGOJUB2ZK2V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ALBEAS#wasThisHelpful","R3GGOJUB2ZK2V8","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review does contain plot spoilers so read at your own risk. :)""It was never about the painting, Sophie.""An amusing fact is that I kept wondering about what happened between Heir Kommandant and Sophie. How is it possible that the author didn't reveal that critical scene? How was I left to guess what happened there? So I was searching the web with the phrase: ""Did Heir Kommandant sleep with Sophie?"" and I found Chapter 9, which contains this critical quote, a chapter that somehow my audio book completely skipped over!!!! Now everything in this dark world makes a lot more sense, and Sophie's story is even more bleak, as if that were possible.I Loved this story so much. This was my 2nd read by Jojo Moyes nd I'm already reading a third and fourth book by her. Her writing style is a symphony to my ears, part Jane-Austen (without censoring the sex, thankfully!) and part modern-day British female novelist with a most capable skill of describing detail. Jojo Moyes is particularly effective in describing love and loss and the journey of the heart and mind as it comes to the realization of one's terrible fate. If you love complex characters put in impossible situations, you will love this war-time love story which tracks the history of a painting that is central to the plot. I enjoy both story and plot in my novels and I suppose it's in my DNA that as a woman, I would enjoy a story of heartbreak, grief, love, loss and Jojo Moyes delivers on every aspect.Many reviewers have said how much they loved the complex war-time story of Sophie and her beloved Edouard over the present-time modern story of Liv and Paul, and frankly, I think that's just easy to do. War-time love stories grip you. It is so hard for us to imagine a world stripped of everything normal, of beauty and humanity and peace, a world filled with terror and fear and atrocity, and to throw a love story in the midst of that makes it impossible to match with any modern day drama. Yet, I feel that it was truly a well-done fantastic novel.I do admit that when we switched over from Sophie's impossible situation in 1917 over to a bar or restaurant in 2006, I was throw off, and I didn't want to care about Liv and her stupid drama, her loss, her grief, and her propensity for a little alcohol. I just didn't care until I did, and then it was impossible to let it go. There are a few more flashbacks from present time over to Sophie's circumstances, and then the rest of the holes are filled with old surviving relatives, hidden letters and other forms of proof uncovered during the trial.Yes, Paul and Liv did not have the same impact as Sophie and her Edouard but why should they? They are in a different age and circumstance. The story has to flow and it did. The loose ends were attended to, the questions answered and you were left feeling so much compassion for characters that you had never met in real life. You know you will cry reading this book, right?The themes were all over the place: Love, loss, sacrifice, uncertainty, fear, terror, hope, despair, anger, rage, helplessness, victimhood, desire, judgment, kindness, beauty, art, humanity and fate.Thank you, Jojo Moyes, for an experience I will not forget. Your characters are etched in my memory, and hard as it was to read and imagine the war time story of Sophie, I am so very glad for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIO0LFUMVX4RX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014312577X#wasThisHelpful","RIO0LFUMVX4RX","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cute short little read even for adults. A friend of mine posted the best quote from the book.""He said, ""You become!"". It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. but these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real, you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""And that is why I picked up this beautiful little read, my first by Margery Williams, and finished it in 20 minutes. It was a break from the heavy-duty stuff I read, and a message I needed to hear. A message that is relevant to so much of life and what we are experiencing, for me it's the path to creating a business and staying humble on the Ashtanga journey, and for you, it may be something else, but it is entirely applicable to an aspect of your life.All the same, I am reserving my 5-stars for books I love-adore-inhale so this is a 4-star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9WE4C0KK2BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQ8C2D6#wasThisHelpful","RE9WE4C0KK2BB","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: I received a free Breathe Essential Oil and here is my honest product review.This is one of my favorite scents of essential oil from this company. I have the Thief Blend, the Muscle Relief and the Good Night scents and I like them all, but this one is probably one of my favorites.How I mostly use it:1. I rub just one drop on my wrists and inhale it right before yoga practice and before bed.2. I put a few drops in my essential oil diffuser and let it run in my office when working or in the room.3. I also put just a couple of drops in my bath salt the other night. It was enough to create even more relaxation and calmness.It is really perfect for opening up the respiratory system especially if you feel slightly congested. I like the smell. It is soothing and calming while energizing. The Eucalyptus is my favorite scent.The company sends these in beautiful brown jars with lovely labeling and coloring. It's not a low quality kind that you would normally get for this price, and I appreciate the attention to detail that went into creating the jars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LSOJAYW67V9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YWHX2JI#wasThisHelpful","R3LSOJAYW67V9Y","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an adult reader of these books, I started the Harry Potter series well over a year ago, and devoured the first 3 books of the 7 and then got side tracked to other books. A few months ago, I decided to go back and finish them when they became available on the Kindle Unlimited Store, and with that long a break, I couldn't just start where I left off, so I re-read all of them. It was a wonderful treat. And I just now finished Book 4.You can immediately notice the darker, deeper, more complex, more grim and perhaps adult-like tone of the books. We are now in the 4th year of Harry's schooling and he meets again with the dark lord and his grotesque plans throw even darker shadows over Harry and Hogwarts.The plot of evil thickens, the friendship bonds between Harry, Ron and Hermione strengthen, even as he spends much of the book on his own, sorting through his own challenges, and Rowling gives you so much more to reflect on. The themes of shame and guilt around identity, the true test of friendship, the acts of selflessness and compassion, the temptations of winning vs. doing the right thing, the power of trust, the test of strength, the resistance to fight your enemies when they tease your friends, and the show of courage even and especially when you are scared out of your mind.My favorites in this book: How Hermione and Harry collaborated, Mad-Eye Moody's protective ways, Hagrid and Madame Maxime's relations, the French kids from Beaubaxton's and the concept of foreign schools even in the Wizarding world, Ron's jealousy and denial, the Weasley twins and their adventures, and the reappearance of Sirius Black.What I love so much about JK Rowling is how REAL she makes it all. How she draws parallels from Hogwarts and magic and the Wizarding world into the regular world, carrying themes of abuse among teens, jealous, compassion, love, worry, anxiety, stress over studies, the desire to win and to impress and to hide your emotions for fear of being laughed at and so much more, it's as if the only difference is that you can do magic in that world but not in the regular world, and yet, you have all the other issues to deal with. Because if magic solved everything, I suppose, then what would the  point of the book or the story? She's beyond brilliant and I can't wait to get into Book 5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NDMWA2PMT42L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0439139600#wasThisHelpful","R1NDMWA2PMT42L","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The coffee smell never goes entirely away and it will affect the aroma of tea. Make it exclusively for tea.This is a large French Press. We made two 16-oz tea mugs and there was still a little room left to fill. If you're making Oolong tea, make sure to drain all of the tea during each steeping so that the wet leaves are not soaking in luke warm water as you are enjoying the first round.It's a beautiful sturdy and nice French Press.

"This is my first essential oil diffuser. I usually just burn incense or rarely use candles for smells and scents, but since I've been getting into essential oils lately, I wanted to test out a diffuser. After reading a bunch of reviews, I settled on this mainly because of the dual function of diffuser and the soothing lights.During the day, I've been using it in my office. In the evenings, I put it in my bedroom and we've been running it all night.The diffuser has two settings for the lights and I usually have it on the dimmed version. I don't believe there is a way to just have the diffuser and not the lights and why would you? The lights change color, I've seen about a half dozen beautiful colors. Each one stays on a few seconds and then it slowly morphs into another color. Very relaxing.For the diffuser part, I fill the water from the tap up to the Max Line marked clearly on the diffuser and then add 4-5 drops of essential oils, put the cover on, and then I plug it in. Make sure you put the diffuser on a flat surface, it does better on a flat wood or metal surface than on cloth or fabric surfaces.The diffuser comes on at intervals. It is not a constant diffuser. Every 10 seconds or so, it comes on for about 8-12 seconds, then a 10-12 second break, then it goes again, and as it comes on, there is a little humming sound that it makes, very low but my husband was noticing it the first night. Update on this a week later: My husband can't seem to sleep to the sound of the oil diffuser coming on, so after much ""discussion"", we are now leaving the oil diffuser part OFF but leaving the light ON - apparently that doesn't bother him. So keep this in mind in case you are a super light sleeper. It doesn't bother me so I'm keeping the 5 stars.It's really relaxing to watch the diffuser with the lights changing and the steam coming off the top and the smell filling up the room. I plan to use it for a very long time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMBKGJ0NJJFE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2CQRZY#wasThisHelpful","RMBKGJ0NJJFE6","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is a patch of an area on the leather sofa which is particularly worn out - it has a sticky feeling - I've tried everything to get it off without lucky.

"I like Gaiam brand in general, but this top is just okay. It's got nice sleeves and a decent material but the back is frumpy and doesn't relax as well in your lower back, so I'm not terribly impressed with the design, but the material is good. It's one of those borrowed designs with imperfect execution, at least on my body.Also, they sent out a Medium instead of a Small, which is making this more of a loose top.

"Hubby and I are on weight watchers, and very proud of ourselves, but one thing we desperately needed to use on a very frequent basis was a kitchen scale. I've been reading reviews of a bunch of different brands and this one looked and felt like the right one so I snatched it up.It is extremely light, but that's not a bad thing. And extremely sensitive too which can be a good thing in a scale. We are usually weighing out all of our foods and what I was looking for was a scale that obviously gives me the accurate measures but also can be reset and turned off relatively quickly. You still have to press the buttons and hold them down a couple of seconds before the LED light goes off.Other than that, so far it's doing its job. I'm afraid I don't have 6 months worth of use to report yet, but I'm giving it a 5 star for now and coming back to update if there should be any changes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GBV4Q6HDQGXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MSZBSI#wasThisHelpful","R1GBV4Q6HDQGXP","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not familiar with the super popular Dr. Bronner's brand, and I came across this through a problem with ahem, smell. Let me explain. I do this crazy yoga called Ashtanga and it's usually a 2 hour sweaty (emphasize the word SWEATY) practice in a room with others. As there's not too many people in my household, we do not do laundry every day and I've struggled with the idea of letting my wet sweaty clothes sit in the hamper until the next wash day. Sometimes it's okay but over time, a lot of my tops developed this disgusting odor because they had gone sour. Another regular wash didn't work so I needed a strong heavy-duty brand of soap to do the job. This stuff was the highest recommended item from my yoga community so we got it, and today we ran a super long load on a 1/4 cup of Dr. Bronner's Fair Trader & Organic Castille Liquid Soap, and the clothes smell wonderful. I love the smell of Tea Tree and the absence of the other smell.As this is a multi purpose soap, I use it also for regular hand washing and other tasks, and it is serving us brilliantly. Really happy with this brand, and I've got the lavender version waiting to be tested, although I think the Tea Tree was a much better deal.So YES to fixing your sour clothes with Dr. Bronner's!

"Imagine if you could go back and redo the big incidents of your life, the ones that led to accidents or tragedies or big irreversible mistakes of your life, and if you could just relive them, and yes relive your entire life too if you took the option, and you could make a smarter, better, more well-informed decision. How different the course of your life would be? How different your outcomes, the people in your life, and the places you end up in.Well, Life after Life is a repetition of this very concept for the incredible LIVES of one Ursula Todd. I never liked Groundhog Day, and much as I like Bill Murray, I found the movie rather annoying. Oh not again! was my sentiment for seeing the same scene over and over, and yet I could appreciate the concept if not the particular events and settings and people. If you could turn back time, what would you do differently? It's not just an interesting concept, it is a massively complex one and it only works if you can do a great job with the execution of it, and Kate Atkinson does it remarkably well. She imagines all the horrible things that could have happened to Ursula, and in some lives, they befall her earlier than in other lives, all marked by the somber words: Darkness fell.Atkinson is rich in her prose, elaborate in her descriptions, and remarkable in creating bonding with the reader - you and me. I had never heard of it until I found this book in the audio selection of Overdrive from the library, and I'm thrilled. She's a phenomenal novelist, with more than a little of Jane Austen in her. The settings of 20th century, the wars, England, Germany, and an upper class British family and the writing style all give me flashbacks to Jane Austen, with a 100 years of period gap.I like Ursula so much and feel for her. I like reading stories where I like the protagonist. I'm finding myself cheering her on and hoping she'll escape this particular tragedy in this life so she can get past this stage and we can move on. I like too that Atkinson is not telling you much at all. You have to pay attention and piece the story and the lives together. You have to know what happened in the past life and what led us to come to this life now. And as someone who is just terrible with novels - or movies - that do weird stuff with timelines, I think I'm following quite well, and so no doubt no other reader will have trouble with it.Since she is writing about the 20th century, Atkinson has no trouble finding powerful themes for her novel: two world wars, Germany, England, bombings in London, women issues, famine, and more interesting topics of adultery, affairs, exploring one's own path in a society and a time that judges your every move, and society does include one's own flesh and blood: one's family. I loved the characters of Ursula, Todd, Izzy, Hugh, and Crichton.In the end, I can't help but feel sorry and nostalgic for Ursula, as if I'm missing the new versions of her life recurring until all eternity. When does it end, the chance to live again? In Groundhog Day, it was after you learned the lesson and could properly move on to tomorrow, but with Ursula? Oh you must really just ready this novel, it's so very good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYY8GJP5SVJ6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316176494#wasThisHelpful","RYY8GJP5SVJ6F","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Gaiam yoga socks could be a real 5 star IF they were not so big. I wear US Shoe size 7.5 and they are a little too big, so they slip off and move around when you try to do some yoga in them but they are very cute, lively color and shades of purple and pink, and a nice stretchy material. I wore them just to walk around the house in them on the hardwood floors and it felt better than walking barefeet. Some support!I don't think you can get a full yoga practice in them, so if you are looking for that level of practical use, I wouldn't recommend them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JLV7PW34LP13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010I7BPEO#wasThisHelpful","R2JLV7PW34LP13","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this monitor for the past few weeks and I find it a solid addition to the Samsung lineup.  My primary monitor has a 16:10 ratio (the great Samsung U2412M), and this one has a 16:9 which is a bit more of a widescreen look.  There are only two connection options, a VGA cable and HDMI (but there are no speakers so you can't use that HDMI connection for any audio).  No USB ports or anything extra like that...just the 2 video inputs and a power plug.Really the only drawback for me is the lack of any up/down adjustments: once the monitor is on the stand then that is the height it will be, so getting it to the proper level with other monitors will require the other monitors to adjust up and down.  A minor annoyance, but I am able to work around it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I7UWDNPV7VAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AQICKG#wasThisHelpful","R3I7UWDNPV7VAA","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received a free Thunder Chalkboard Stick-on Labels and White Color Liquid Chalk Pen and here's my honest review.I have never used a product like this so I was excited. You get several sheets of stickers, different shapes, and the black is very nice with a polished look about it. And then you get a single pen to use along.First downer I had was that the sticky labels was stuck a little too hard onto the paper. It took me a lot of work to get it completely out, and I lost a couple. I don't know why this was the case.The second downer is the pen, it is not nearly as bright and white against the black background as you'd like to see. I can understand that if I had been using it for a while but it is totally fresh!!! I wonder if it will run out way before I run out of stickers.They do wash off easier and you can reuse them and reapply them but the less-than-sharp-clear pen makes it hard to give this more than a 3 star.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TF9T0H7W22OR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015J5ISGS#wasThisHelpful","R1TF9T0H7W22OR","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received this non-slip eco-friendly AVIVA yoga mat free in exchange for an honest review.I am so grateful to AVIVA for making such great beautiful products. I love their yoga blocks and I really wanted to LOVE this yoga mat too. It is a great double sided mat that you can use for mild yoga, Kundalini, or gentle yoga. I have it spread out on my yoga studio floor and I use it to push up onto handstands and for knee support. the surface area is very soft cushy material with some patterns along the mat for focus and concentration. It's also perfect for meditation! I also love the colors: orange on one side and navy on the other.Because it's so soft and cushy, it folds up really nice for travel in a luggage too.Unfortunately, for the type of yoga I do, which is sweaty hard-core Ashtanga yoga, it doesn't work well. When you sweat, the mat doesn't absorb the sweat and so it becomes quite slippery. My go-to mat is a Manduka and if you are used to practicing on that, this won't give you the support and stickiness factor that you absolutely need to do your practice. So take sweat and the type of your yoga into account, but if you want just to have a spare yoga mat around, it's a great and beautiful mat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ENW0NNHDY2TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VP2WS5W#wasThisHelpful","R2ENW0NNHDY2TQ","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: I was given a free 6-pack in exchange for a fair and honest review.The socks arrived in some kind of bubble wrapped box, which was very strange, as socks are the last item to be considered ""Fragile!"" but whatever. It was a protective packaging. You get 6 pairs and I initially thought that these are for me - I'm a woman! - but they seemed very big so my husband took them. We washed them before he wore them, so regarding the other review, I can't say how they smelled. I didn't smell them! They seem to be decent socks, - nothing special about them.

".. beyond a shadow of a doubt, too scary for children and some adults. I didn't know what Coraline was about except that there was a little girl, a world behind the wall and well, Neil Gaiman. My 6th book by Neil Gaiman was yet another success. I listened to this read by the author himself and it was delicious. Nobody can tell a story as well as Neil. He is exquisite. He has an imagination like no other, and you can hear his invisible signature in all of his works. As you can tell, I adore Neil Gaiman and this book is a solid 5 stars. I can't say that I *loved* it - I never say that about Neil's work. I just enjoy them immensely. I can't help not listening onceFor the over-sensitive, just be forewarned. I'm not speaking to the plot as much but there may be some references that may be considered a spoiler in your book.As to the story, it's short and not-so-so-sweet ;)! It started off great, and Coraline's life was perfectly boring and normal until she went through the door in the parlor. And then the parallel worlds started to collide into one another. The Other parents. The Other neighbors. The other life. You know, one of my favorite phrases in this book was when Coraline says to the Other neighbor, ""I don't want what I want. Nobody does! What's the fun of getting everything that we want?"" I love that truth - I don't want what I want. We want what we have, I suppose, and we are reminded of it so much more fiercely when we lose it, which is the great theme of this book when Coraline is separated from her real parents and her real life, the boring and normal one that she was trying to get away from, and such is the sweet irony of life.As much as I enjoyed the book, something about it made me shudder. It was creepy and scary and bizarre and weird, and it was extremely well done but something. Maybe it's Gaiman's fascination with rodents, all the business with mice and rats. Maybe it was the button eyes. Yeah that one was creepy. Maybe it was the souls in the closet. I don't know. Maybe it was the unknowns of the world he had created. I think it was missing context - more context as to what this world was. More telling from the author and less guessing from the reader. Yes, that's it. I wanted more of that but hey, maybe I didn't. Do we really want what we want? Coraline doesn't think so, so who am I to argue? Hey, just read it. It's only 200+ pages and it's Neil Gaiman. Such a genius!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MKVVD1TA4GNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007F0IXD4#wasThisHelpful","R2MKVVD1TA4GNI","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: I received a free Lumo Lift to use and below is my honest review on the product.Being in front of a computer most of the day, I found myself falling into a pattern of slouching down into my seat.  That, coupled with the fact that I ""look down"" at my hand held devices which put my neck at an awkward angle, definitely contributed to various tingling and pain in my arms, back and neck.Thankfully, the Zumo Lift is just what I needed to become mindful of my posture. It was very easy to pair with my smartphone (via Bluetooth) and after a couple of minutes figuring the device out I was able to put it to use.  The device will ""buzz"" if it finds itself out of alignment with the preset ""good posture position"", and after the first couple of days of using it I found that I was more cognizant of my posture because I knew I was wearing the device.  Even the times when I wasn't wearing the device I was paying attention to how I was carrying myself so it definitely makes you more aware of how you are sitting and standing.

"My SimpleHuman trashcan is probably about 7 years old by now. I have since purchased one for my parents and one for my in-laws. I heard my brother also uses this trashcan. This is a must-have for any nice usable functional kitchen, hands down! Here's why we LOVE our Simplehuman trashcan.Trashcans, to be perfectly honest, were never on my shopping list, much less on a list of item that I would research and spend so much money on, but after using disgusting old smelly cheap trashcan for years, I decided ENOUGH. My kitchen deserves a nice looking and more importantly, functional trashcan that looks as good as the rest of my appliances.I love simplehuman because:1. The stainless steel clean look with black. Stylish and clean.2. Keeps odors in. I can't impress upon you how important this function is especially when the trashcan is out in the kitchen and not in some closet.3. Holds a lot of trash. It's nice not to have to empty the trash so frequently without the consequences of smell and stink!4. Functional for years.5. Easy to change bags, insert new ones, and clean the inside black plastic trashcan which comes out and can be hosed down and washed if need be.Best and most functional item for any decent kitchen. Simplehuman has delivered a great product here.

"Disclaimer: I received a complimentary Bago Travel bag and here's my honest review.This is a small backpack that gets folded into a nice zippable bag that you can then throw into your suitcase and take with you for use at destination. The material is great - it's a nice quality of nylon with a nice pattern on the black and the dark muted colors are easy to match with anything. That's the color I received and like it. They also have bright colors you can choose from.This is perfect for a daypack on travel. I see myself using it on occasion when a day's hike may be involved. It is something I would only wear when I am dressed very casually. It's a very sportish bag and I wouldn't wear it if I were dressed nicer for the day. Maybe I'm funny that way but I do try to match the bag to my attire :)!You can adjust the strap and use the side pockets for small bottles of water. The bag itself is smaller than I had thought also, without any cushion so I would not put my laptop in there without some cushion and padding on it. It's meant to be for small quick errands when you are away to give you room for extra storage. It's also rain proof and so no worry on getting things wet.It is a simple design for a simple function and it is well made. I would recommend it if you want to pack an extra bag on your next travels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NSVTRAQR5343/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FUWSTI8#wasThisHelpful","R2NSVTRAQR5343","A2PATWWZAXHQYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PATWWZAXHQYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love these bolsters. They are firm, so if you are looking for something softer, Manduka has some great softer cushions but these bolsters are firm, and I don't believe the cover unzips - I saw that someone was trying to wash the cover, I don't recommend that. It's a very tight fit around the bolster and I would not want to put it back on. It's not exactly like a pillow case over a pillow.The print, the design, the feel of the fabric and the colors are LOVELY. Hugger Mugger is exclusive and you simply want to HUG these bolster! :)Best use for this bolster: Put a block on one far end of your mat, put the top of the bolster on the block so it lays at an angle, then put your lower back to the end of the bolster and lay flat on the raised edge, relaxing your arms on each side.

"All it took for me to pick up ‚ÄúTrinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger Volume 3: The Crack in Creation‚Äù was the presence of Swamp Thing on the cover. DC Comics knew exactly what they were doing and I fell for it. I‚Äôm a sucker for anything that features Bernie Wrightson and Len Wein‚Äôs mossy creature. Unfortunately, he didn‚Äôt figure into the story as much as I would‚Äôve hoped. That‚Äôs not to say the book wasn‚Äôt compelling.With the Justice League missing and the villains in control, Phantom Stranger must destroy evil itself! But to stop the Crime Syndicate, Deadman must take control of Aquaman‚Äôs body!The official synopsis provided by DC is really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to ‚ÄúTrinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger Volume 3: The Crack in Creation.‚Äù There‚Äôs so much more here than just what they describe. The Phantom Stranger must save his guardian angel, partner with the Spectre to do battle against the Sin Eater and his evil minions, and face his day of judgment against a council made up of his most dangerous enemies.He does all of this while battling his own will to rebel against his Maker and take things into his own hands. The fact that so much of the book deals with spiritual battles within ourselves is part of what kept me interested in ‚ÄúTrinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger Volume 3: The Crack in Creation.‚Äù Granted, there are a lot of religious ideologies mixed together here. Although much of it is based in Christianity and the teachings of the Bible, other world religions end up being blended in and create a hodge podge of New Age mumbo jumbo in the end.The concept of the Phantom Stranger being Judas Iscariot atoning for his betrayal of Jesus Christ intrigued me immediately. His is a story about the road to redemption and his constant struggle to keep the faith and blindly follow the Will of God wherever it takes him. J.M. DeMatteis, Len Wein, and Dan Didio do a good job combining forces to keep readers engaged through this collection of issues 12 through 22 of the Trinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger and Trinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger Future‚Äôs End #1.One problem I had with ‚ÄúTrinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger Volume 3: The Crack in Creation‚Äù is the way the different issues skip ahead in the story, leaving out major events talked about but never witnessed on the page. It felt like most of the action took place in other issues of different comic book titles. That‚Äôs one of the problems of having a combined universe. Things happen to characters in another issue of another series that affects the book you‚Äôre invested in. There‚Äôs too much interweaving of storylines between the different character titles. The only way you could keep up with it all is if you won the lottery and had a few hundred dollars a month and 24 hours a day to dedicate to comic book reading.‚ÄúTrinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger Volume 3: The Crack in Creation‚Äù is rated ‚ÄúT‚Äù for Teens. There‚Äôs the usual comic book violence, some mild language, and partial nudity. I don‚Äôt know which artist or artists it is, but someone has an obsession with naked bodies of all types. Whether it‚Äôs lost souls or our superheroes being stripped (literally) of their costumes and powers, you better believe they‚Äôre three-quarters naked.I do have my problems with the religious aspects of ‚ÄúTrinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger Volume 3: The Crack in Creation‚Äù being all jumbled together. However, if you treat the book as a work of fiction influenced by the Bible and other religions, it‚Äôs an entertaining read that blends together love, loss, regret, and redemption with a healthy dose of action and adventure. The inclusion of John Constantine, Swamp Thing, the Spectre, and Superman is an added bonus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REU7O2ERYCLFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401250963#wasThisHelpful","REU7O2ERYCLFI","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mill Creek Entertainment gives children of the 1980s and their offspring a double dose of sci-fi fun with the ‚ÄúKrull / Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone‚Äù Combo DVD release. ‚ÄúKrull‚Äù recently had its Blu-ray debut. ‚ÄúSpacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone‚Äù hasn‚Äôt seen the light of day since hitting DVD back in 2001. The two movies put together in one package is a great way for genre fans to pick them up.I recently reviewed the ‚ÄúKrull‚Äù Blu-ray when it was released through Mill Creek Entertainment. If you‚Äôre interested, you can read my review right here. In a nutshell, it‚Äôs an epic hero‚Äôs journey that mixes together ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù and ‚ÄúLord of the Rings.‚Äù However, modern audiences might find its pacing a bit slow in places.‚ÄúSpacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone‚Äù is a blend of a couple different influences on science fiction flicks of the 1980s. Imagine if a reluctant hero-for-hire in the vein of Han Solo traveled to a planet where the inhabitants live in a society that resembled the dystopian world of ‚ÄúThe Road Warrior.‚Äù It comes complete with scavengers, mutants, and a makeshift city whose citizens enjoy watching people fight for their lives in a deadly maze. It all sounds a little familiar, eh? It also sounds like a lot of fun!In the year 2136, Wolff (Peter Strauss), a wily salvage pilot and intergalactic bounty hunter, answers a distress signal on Terra Eleven. Agreeing to pick up three women who've been shipwrecked, he lands on the planet only to discover they've been kidnapped. Following their trail, Wolff soon encounters Niki (Molly Ringwald), a spunky orphan who agrees to guide him across the Forbidden Zone, a vast wasteland populated by plague-infested mutants. After many battles, Wolff and Niki finally reach the lair of Overdog (Michael Ironside), the planet's half-man / half-machine ruler. Discovering the women are held captive in Overdog's slave pens, Wolff's rescue mission finally begins.‚ÄúSpacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone‚Äù was originally released during the 3-D craze of the early 1980s. ‚ÄúJaws 3-D,‚Äù ‚ÄúFriday the 13th, Part 3-D, and ‚ÄúAmityville 3-D‚Äù are other movies which are more identifiable from this era. The film is presented in 2-D on DVD, but you can definitely tell where the 3-D would‚Äôve played a part at times.The cast of ‚ÄúSpacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone‚Äù was made up of some familiar 1980s faces. Peter Strauss is known for his many roles in television shows and movies. Ernie Hudson is best known for his character Winston Zeddemore in ‚ÄúGhostbusters‚Äù and ‚ÄúGhostbusters II.‚Äù When the movie came out in 1983, Molly Ringwald‚Äôs only major parts were in ‚ÄúDiff‚Äôrent Strokes‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Facts of Life.‚Äù She comes off as an annoying tag-along here until the end of the film, where she makes an attempt at redeeming herself by facing down her fear and working hard to stay alive. Michael Ironside fully embraced his role as the cyborg tyrant Overdog.Both ‚ÄúKrull‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone‚Äù are rated PG. ‚ÄúKrull‚Äù features mild violence and gore, and frightening / intense sequences. ‚ÄúSpacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone‚Äù includes mild violence and gore, profanity, and frightening / intense scenes. One of the bat creatures in the film is shown topless, but it‚Äôs not known whether the monster is male or female. There‚Äôs definitely nothing sexy about the scene.‚ÄúKrull / Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone‚Äù Sci-Fi Double Feature is a bare-bones release. There aren‚Äôt any special features to be found. Most fans of the films won‚Äôt even care. It‚Äôs the first time either one has been available in over 10 years.Newer viewers might find the ‚ÄúKrull / Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone‚Äù Sci-Fi Double Feature a bit heavy on the cheese and slow in stride. The special effects are all practical as well. It‚Äôs nice to see all the hard work the crew put into the visual look of the film. If you love the original ‚ÄúStar Wars,‚Äù then you‚Äôll no doubt enjoy these two offerings from Mill Creek Entertainment. Watch them through the eyes of a 10 year old in 1983 and everything will be fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LLWYKZPQZN1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU4MUD2#wasThisHelpful","R2LLWYKZPQZN1W","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You say you haven‚Äôt had enough of Edward and Bella? You need more of Jacob Black‚Äôs pecs in your life? You prefer glittering fangless vampires to the nasty, messy, and unattractive ones found in ‚Äú30 Days of Night?‚Äù Summit Entertainment heard your cries and fulfills yours deepest wishes with ‚ÄúThe Twilight Saga Extended Editions.‚Äù‚ÄúThe Twilight Saga Extended Editions‚Äù includes ‚ÄúTwilight,‚Äù ‚ÄúNew Moon,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEclipse.‚Äù Don‚Äôt ask me why they didn‚Äôt throw in ‚ÄúBreaking Dawn‚Äù Parts 1 and 2. Part 1 already has an extended edition and would‚Äôve been rather painless for the studio to include. Why didn‚Äôt they just piece together an extended version of Part 2 and make this release a fan‚Äôs ultimate dream package? We‚Äôll probably never know.‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù features 4 extra minutes of romance and drama. ‚ÄúNew Moon‚Äù is extended from 130 minutes to 137 minutes. ‚ÄúEclipse‚Äù is bumped up from 124 minutes to 129 minutes. Basically, you‚Äôre buying all 3 movies again for 16 minutes of added footage. If you‚Äôre one of the legions of enthusiasts who adore this franchise, it‚Äôll be worth every penny.‚ÄúThe Twilight Saga Extended Editions‚Äù come together in one regular sized Blu-ray amaray case. It‚Äôs pretty darn nice when it comes to storage. The new packaging sure beats the heck out of the bulky ‚ÄúTwilight Forever‚Äù behemoth. There‚Äôs only one problem: it doesn‚Äôt include either of the ‚ÄúBreaking Dawn‚Äù movies or the special features! If you‚Äôre a completist, you have to find space on your shelf for both sets.Let me jump up on my soap box for a minute now. Although ‚ÄúThe Twilight Saga‚Äù does send some negative messages to girls out there, it also has some good ones I enjoyed seeing as well. Bella is weak and way too obsessed with a guy to the point that she will do anything for him. It makes her sort of pathetic. However, I did appreciate the fact that Edward and Bella kept from having pre-marital sex in a day when not much thought is put into giving yourself away to anybody who comes along. Even though it‚Äôs not part of the set, I liked the fact that Bella wouldn‚Äôt kill her baby in ‚ÄúBreaking Dawn,‚Äù which directly or indirectly (if you ask Director Bill Condon) promoted pro-life.If you can settle for just the first three movies with no special features in one handy set and already have the ‚ÄúBreaking Dawn‚Äù Blu-rays, ‚ÄúThe Twilight Saga Extended Editions‚Äù will satisfy you. I‚Äôm one of the ten guys on the planet Earth that actually like this series and I was a bit annoyed when I received it not to see all the movies included. Some folks might feel like they‚Äôre being taken advantage of after buying the movies multiple times by now.I gave the movies 3 stars because the set is missing the extended editions of ""Breaking Dawn"" Parts 1 and 2.I gave the movies 3 stars because the set is missing the extended editions of ""Breaking Dawn"" Parts 1 and 2.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R242MTPIT5LM13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYTCV46#wasThisHelpful","R242MTPIT5LM13","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember seeing ‚ÄúSupernova‚Äù back in 2000 when it originally came out on DVD. Like most people, I thought it looked great at the time, but really didn‚Äôt have much else going for it. My opinion hasn‚Äôt really changed since re-visiting it after the movie‚Äôs recent Blu-ray upgrade by Scream Factory. The special effects and design are still the highlight of a sci-fi film that suffers from simply maintaining the status genre quo and offering nothing new.The medical ship Nightingale 229 travels through deep space in the early 22nd century taking on search and rescue missions it‚Äôs assigned to. Its six-member crew includes a Captain and Pilot (Robert Forster), a co-pilot (James Spader), a medical officer (Angela Bassett, a medical technician (Luo Diamond Phillips), a search and rescue paramedic (Robin Tunney), and a computer technician (Wilson Cruz). When their vessel, the Nightingale 229, answers an emergency distress signal from a comet mining operation in a distant galaxy, the crew soon finds itself in danger from the mysterious young man they rescue, the alien artifact he's smuggled aboard, and the gravitational pull of a giant star about to supernova. The resulting explosion will be the most massive explosion in the universe.What was originally planned as a low-budget study of human relationships amongst the stars quickly mutated into a rather lackluster action yarn about picking up a stray and his alien artifact. Of course we all know the object can‚Äôt be good and the whole situation goes south very quickly in a matter of 90 minutes. It‚Äôs evident by the way the movie progresses in a very choppy and rushed pace that there was more to the story than what we get here. There were 15 minutes of deleted scenes for the movie included, so I can only imagine there has to be even more footage lying in a box somewhere out there.The cast would be considered an ensemble these days since most of the actors have gone on to do bigger and better things since ‚ÄúSupernova.‚Äù James Spader, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robert Forster, and Angela Bassett were already established stars at the time of this movie‚Äôs release. Peter Facinelli went on to play the patriarch of the Cullen vampire clan, Carlisle, in ‚ÄúThe Twilight Saga.‚Äù Robin Tunney worked on ‚ÄúPrison Break‚Äù and continues as a member of the cast of ‚ÄúThe Mentalist.‚Äù Here they just walk around angry with grim looks on their faces.‚ÄúSupernova‚Äù is rated R for sci-fi action violence and sensuality / nudity. There are at least two topless shots of Robin Tunney and a rather explicit love scene. Director Walter Hill (operating under the pseudonym Thomas Lee) was definitely fascinated with the human body. He stalls on one shot of Peter Facinelli‚Äôs backend for what seems like an eternity. Angela Bassett gets her opportunity to bare all, albeit in the shadows, as well. There‚Äôs an acceptable amount of gore as Facinelli‚Äôs character continuously gets beat upon. However, even this aspect of the film seems uneven. Sometimes we get to see the carnage, while at others it‚Äôs edited out nice and neat.Although there really isn‚Äôt much going on here in a spiritual sense, one line of dialogue that James Spader utters stood out to me. When the crew is coming to grips with the chain of events Peter Facinelli‚Äôs character has unraveled, he makes a bold statement. Spader proclaims, ‚ÄúWhat if they didn't crucify Christ, but they did!"" He uses such an extreme example to explain that it doesn‚Äôt matter what could‚Äôve been. What‚Äôs more important is dealing with what is. Angela Bassett‚Äôs character also dramatically makes a comparison between aliens and God when she says, ‚ÄúWhoever they are, they're as smart as God and a lot less nice.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think so.Scream Factory‚Äôs Blu-ray debut of ‚ÄúSupernova‚Äù is presented in 1080p Widescreen (2.36:1) with DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. Special features include a ‚ÄúMaking of ‚ÄôSupernova‚Äô‚Äù feature, deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and theatrical trailer.‚ÄúSupernova‚Äù isn‚Äôt completely void of any entertainment value. It just lacks the endeavor to be anything more than a slick sci-fi action yarn. It will remind you of the awkward era of filmmaking when studios were transitioning from working with real models and sets and moving into the arena of CGI effects. If you‚Äôve ran out of other alien encounter movies, this will tide you over until something new and bolder comes along.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XD9418BY9ASU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCFHHNC#wasThisHelpful","R2XD9418BY9ASU","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although its roots lie in the legend of Bloody Mary, the ‚ÄúCandyman‚Äù franchise built a mythos all its own in the span of three movies. Actor Tony Todd would argue that the entire series revolves around a tragic story of unrequited love and the vengeance rained down upon those who dare disturb the tortured soul of the title character. I would absolutely agree with him, especially after ‚ÄúCandyman: Farewell to the Flesh‚Äù expands on the backstory of our antagonist.Candyman moves on to New Orleans and starts his horrific murders once more. This time, his intended victim is a school teacher. Her father was killed by Candyman, and brother wrongly accused of the murders.Instead of the usual horror film retread we get when it comes to sequels, ‚ÄúCandyman: Farewell to the Flesh‚Äù actually expands on the history of the character by visually telling his tale onscreen. It pounds home the tragedy surrounding Candyman and brings more of a sense of humanity to the ‚Äúvillain‚Äù of the story.Tony Todd brings Candyman to life and makes you both feel sorry for and fear his character. He brings an air of refinement to what could have been just another slasher icon. Veronica Cartwright plays a widowed southern belle who has a secret of her own to keep. Even in 1995, she was already a veteran of the horror genre because of roles in ‚ÄúAlien,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Birds,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Witches of Eastwick,‚Äù ‚ÄúInvasion of the Body Snatchers,‚Äù and more.I‚Äôm fascinated by writer and atheist Clive Barker‚Äôs attraction to Christian religion and Catholic imagery as showcased once again in ‚ÄúCandyman: Farewell to the Flesh.‚Äù This time it‚Äôs exemplified through the events of Mardis Gras in New Orleans and the religious meanings behind the celebration. I also found it interesting that one of the main focuses of the lynch mob was a middle-aged lady carrying her Bible and encouraging the torture of Candyman.‚ÄúCandyman: Farewell to the Flesh‚Äù is rated R for violence and gore, and for some sexuality and language. There‚Äôs the expected amount of blood and onscreen butchering you would expect from a horror movie. A couple are shown having sex in public on two occasions. They‚Äôre nude and shown from the side, but no actual privates are shown.Special features for Scream Factory‚Äôs Blu-ray release of ‚ÄúCandyman: Farewell to the Flesh‚Äù includes audio commentary by Director Bill Condon, ‚ÄúThe Candyman Legacy with Tony Todd‚Äù featurette, ‚ÄúDown Memory Lane with Veronica Cartwright‚Äù featurette, and a theatrical trailer.‚ÄúCandyman: Farewell to the Flesh‚Äù rises above what could have been just another pedestrian follow-up to a slasher flick. Instead of simply lining up new faceless victims for the killer to take out with his hook hand for no reason, our dreadful anti-hero is given substance and motivation for his actions. An air of mystery and a dark family secret add another level of elegance to the movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ8A8JUBFR84J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OAIHJ0C#wasThisHelpful","RZ8A8JUBFR84J","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love ‚ÄúStar Trek.‚Äù I wish I could watch an episode of the original series, ‚ÄúThe Next Generation,‚Äù or ‚ÄúEnterprise‚Äù every single day of my life. However, my wife hates the entire franchise. I‚Äôm forced to catch a movie or episode any time she‚Äôs at least a thousand feet from the house and can‚Äôt hear the theme music or the voices of the actors.CBS Blu-ray makes it easy on folks looking for the brighter spots by putting out the most important and popular two-part episodes of ‚ÄúStar Trek: The Next Generation‚Äù flawlessly seamed together into feature length films. They remind me of the key adventures I need to re-visit on a regular basis. In celebration of the release of the seventh and final season, we get the series‚Äô epic swan song ‚ÄúAll Good Things.‚ÄùPast, present and future collide for Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) as he finds himself bouncing around through three different time periods -- the Farpoint mission, the present, and the future in which many changes have affected the Enterprise-D crew. Meanwhile, the mischievous Q (John de Lancie) is back for his last time trying to help Picard figure out the meaning of a spatial anomaly... or is he only making things worse?One section of the combined episode is reminiscent of ‚ÄúStar Trek III: The Search for Spock.‚Äù The aged crew must come together and follow their former Captain on an unauthorized mission to save the entire universe. It also gives everyone a chance to see what the crew is up to and will look like as they grow older. Of course, things can change if the timeline is screwed with.The only part of ‚ÄúStar Trek: The Next Generation ‚Äì All Good Things‚Äù I had an issue with is its nods to evolution. Q takes Picard to the area where France will be billions of years in the past and shows him a puddle of primordial ooze we‚Äôll form from. Any Creationist is going to have an issue with this sequence.Special features for ‚ÄúStar Trek: The Next Generation ‚Äì All Good Things‚Äù include audio commentary by Michael D. Moore and Brannon Braga, ‚ÄúThe Unknown Possibilities of Existence: Making ‚ÄòAll Good Things‚Äô‚Äù featurette, episodic promos (Parts 1 and 2), and deleted scenes.‚ÄúStar Trek: The Next Generation ‚Äì All Good Things‚Äù ends the series with a cataclysmic danger to humanity which trumps anything the crew has ever faced. It brings the series full circle through picking up with the trial which began in the first episode of the show, ‚ÄúEncounter at Farpoint.‚Äù Q became such an iconic figure it only seems fitting that the series ends with a universal threat brought on by the godlike being and his judicial court.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7AS6VV1TWLDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAIMHMS#wasThisHelpful","R7AS6VV1TWLDM","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‚ÄúTusk‚Äù is one of those films the saying ‚ÄúThere are things you can‚Äôt unsee‚Äù was created about. Kevin Smith‚Äôs latest horror film is like the car wreck you can‚Äôt keep from looking at.

Even though he‚Äôs shameful, you can‚Äôt help but feel sorry for him. ‚ÄúTusk‚Äù also leaves you contemplating how awful it would be to live your life out as a monster no one can stand to look at.The cast of ‚ÄúTusk‚Äù all perform their parts well. They deliver their lines and portray their characters with all the sincerity you could muster for an irreverent Kevin Smith vehicle. Just like all his other movies, there‚Äôs a lot of dialogue between the scenes of terror and zaniness to wade through.‚ÄúTusk‚Äù is rated R for some disturbing violence / gore, language and sexual content. There are no sex scenes or nudity, but plenty of innuendos just like you would expect from a Kevin Smith film. Severed body parts are seen throughout. Take my word for it when I tell you what you see here truly can‚Äôt be unseen.I don't condone much of what Kevin Smith is known for and definitely don't share his same stances on many issues. However, he is an admirable filmmaker who takes real life experiences and characters you can identify with and relate to and puts them onscreen for you to enjoy and ponder.Special Features for ""Tusk"" include deleted scenes, audio commentary with Writer / Director Kevin Smith, ‚Äú20 Years to 'Tusk'‚Äù featurette, ‚ÄúThe Making of 'Tusk'‚Äù featurettes, and Smodcast #259: The Walrus and The Carpenter.I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as saying ‚ÄúTusk‚Äù is a perfect movie. There will be moments where you wonder why certain stretches of dialogue are being uttered or what the point of a scene was.

"Marvel might be riding high now as a member of the Disney family, but twenty years ago it was literally taking any deal it could get from Tinseltown to make some money off the different properties they owned. Low-budget versions of ‚ÄúCaptain America,‚Äù ‚ÄúFantastic Four,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Punisher‚Äù are perfect examples of where the comic book publishing giant was heading at the time. Even George Lucas‚Äôs bigger attempt at bringing ‚ÄúHoward the Duck‚Äù to life was a miserable failure.With all the hype surrounding the upcoming release of Scott Derrickson‚Äôs ‚ÄúDoctor Strange,‚Äù it only made sense that Full Moon Features would take advantage of all the chatter and excitement by releasing its own version of the tale on Blu-ray. For those who might not know, Marvel gave rights to Full Moon Features in the early 1990s to adapt the mystical magician‚Äôs adventures into a live-action movie. When time ran out and the property went back to Marvel, Charles Band decided to move forward with his rendering altered enough to keep from crossing any lines of copyright infringement.Doctor Mordrid (Jeffrey Combs) is a powerful sorcerer who has sworn to keep Earth safe from the powers of darkness throughout the universe. His arch-enemy Kabal (Brian Thompson) arrives with plans to destroy the world. The two clash in an epic battle of good and evil that includes destructive mystical abilities and re-animated prehistoric creatures.You can tell as soon as the opening credits roll on ‚ÄúDoctor Mordrid: Master of the Unknown‚Äù Directors / Producers Charles Band and his father Albert were quite passionate about bringing one of their favorite superheroes to life, even if he was under a new name with a re-tooled storyline and origin. Obviously, the movie was made on a budget that limited some of what could be done. It still looks great and the entire cast is fully invested in their individual roles.The Blu-ray upgrade for ‚ÄúDoctor Mordrid: Master of the Unknown‚Äù provides a clean picture to enjoy all the practical effects and stop-motion work the Full Moon crew put into the production. It‚Äôs a true pleasure to see actual physical sets and props onscreen versus CGI landscapes and the likes. The 5.1 surround sound transports Richard Band‚Äôs musical score and all the blasts of magic to every corner of your home theater.Special features for ‚ÄúDoctor Mordrid: Master of the Unknown‚Äù include audio commentary with Jeffrey Combs and Charles Band. An original Videozone featurette is found as well. William Shatner talks with Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, and Stuart Gordon for a rare round-table discussion. It also contains uncut behind-the-scenes footage from the Full Moon Vault.‚ÄúDoctor Mordrid: Master of the Unknown‚Äù is unrated but should hold an R for all intents and purposes. There‚Äôs only one scene of nudity, which was really unnecessary and could‚Äôve been cut or edited to open the picture up to even younger viewers. There was some violence and language as well, but nothing that would‚Äôve caused it to be rated anything more than PG-13.1992‚Äôs ‚ÄúDoctor Mordrid: Master of the Unknown‚Äù still stands up well today even though elements of it might seem aged. It‚Äôs a reminder of where comic book properties stood in the grand scheme of Hollywood at that time.

"For someone who claims to be an atheist, Clive Barker sure does delve into the afterlife and spiritual realm a whole lot. From ‚ÄúNightbreed‚Äù to ‚ÄúHellraiser,‚Äù the author / director seems to have an obsession with what‚Äôs to come once we shuffle off this mortal coil. Scream Factory‚Äôs release of ‚ÄúLord of Illusions: Collector‚Äôs Edition‚Äù reminds horror fans of his passionate and dark dwellings on the realm of the dead. This new version assembles the Director‚Äôs Cut and the theatrical one with new and old special features for its debut on Blu-ray.Private Detective Harry D‚ÄôAmour (Scott Bakula) is caught up investigating the deaths of several reformed cult members. As he digs deeper for one of the victims‚Äô widows (Famke Janssen), he is exposed to the dangerous worlds of illusions and magic. D‚ÄôAmour soon learns that illusions are trickery, but magic is very real and very deadly.The 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer for the Director‚Äôs Cut gives home viewers the perfect visual experience. The practical and special effects for ‚ÄúLord of Illusions‚Äù are still impressive, even if their limitations are more evident because of a clearer picture. Knowing that all the gruesome carnage seen onscreen was achieved without the use of CGI is a breath of realistic fresh air.Both the Director‚Äôs Cut and theatrical version of ‚ÄúLord of Illusions‚Äù give viewers the option to switch between DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Either way, the musical score, dialogue, and audio effects will plunge you into the woeful recesses of Clive Barker‚Äôs mind. It‚Äôs left up to you what level you want to descend to.‚ÄúLord of Illusions: Collector‚Äôs Edition‚Äù comes with plenty of extra material thanks to Scream Factory‚Äôs loving attention. Clive Barker provides commentary for his Director‚Äôs Cut. ‚ÄúA Gathering of Magic‚Äù featurette gives us a glimpse into the making of the film. A new interview with Storyboard Artist Martin Mercer is found. Original Behind-the-Scenes footage, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery are included as well.The Director‚Äôs Cut is unrated and with good reason. There‚Äôs loads of violence and gore, nudity, language, sexuality, and adult situations. Not only are we exposed to female nudity, we get full frontal male nudity as well. Some of it is shrouded in shadows, but still visible.‚ÄúLord of Illusions: Collector‚Äôs Edition‚Äù reminds us all of what a great blend of noir and horror Clive Barker‚Äôs film is. It does an excellent job of showing us what can happen if we become obsessed with attaining power and forbidden knowledge through the occult. Even though he might not fully believe in it, Barker teaches us that playing with magic and supernatural forces can only do harm. You might not want to own it, but it‚Äôs worth a watch just for its interesting take on the subject matter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIDOINZO4FUOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NALHKN6#wasThisHelpful","RIDOINZO4FUOL","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scream Factory follows up its release of the original horror classic with the sequel ‚ÄúPumpkinhead II: Blood Wings.‚Äù While not quite as satisfying as its predecessor, you can‚Äôt help but have a level of respect for screenwriters Ivan and Constantine Chachornia for trying to change things up a bit when it comes to the storyline of the film. We get the same premise, but with a little detective work and two intertwining motivations for the title creature to go on its killing spree to mix it up. The acting is a bit cheesy, but what can be expected from a movie made in the mid-1990s that obviously would feel more at home in the 1980s.A group of teen troublemakers resurrect the spirit of vengeance known as Pumpkinhead (Mark McCracken). Trapped inside the monster is the tormented soul of a young boy named Tommy (J.P. Manoux). First, pieces of the bodies of the gang who murdered him begin to pile up. After that, the creature‚Äôs focus changes to the high schoolers who mortally wounded his caretaker. Pumpkinhead will stop at nothing until those who have wronged him are served bloody justice.‚ÄúPumpkinhead II: Blood Wings‚Äù is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.85:1). Its video upgrade provides a clearer picture while not sacrificing its original film flavor. Made up of all practical special effects, the clarity doesn‚Äôt showcase CGI limitations the way it does with newer movies. There‚Äôs nothing quite as satisfying as looking at the TV and knowing what you‚Äôre seeing is actually tangible and not an X that an actor is staring at on a green screen. However, the creature‚Äôs point-of-view vision is rather dated and comes across as a bit hokey.Given a 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo upgrade, ‚ÄúPumpkinhead II: Blood Wings‚Äù isn‚Äôt quite as fulfilling in the sound department as a 5.1 surround mix would be. It still gets the job done, blending together the musical score, sound effects, dialogue, and ear-piercing screams of the fiend‚Äôs many victims. The shrills of the tormented and growl of Pumpkinhead will still leave you looking over your shoulders and nervously twitching.‚ÄúPumpkinhead II: Blood Wings‚Äù is rated R for horror violence, sexuality, nudity, and language. It‚Äôs unfortunate that the filmmakers felt it necessary to sink into typical slasher territory with one avoidable topless sex scene and another dream sequence that feels forced by producers to be included. These two sequences are part of the reason this sequel doesn‚Äôt measure up to the superior original when it comes to rising above average teen fare.Scream Factory includes some entertaining special features. There are interviews with Director Jeff Burr, Special Effects Artists Greg Nicotero and Gino Crognale, and Actor Mark McCracken. We also get a featurette entitled ‚ÄúRe-creating the Monster.‚Äù‚ÄúPumpkinhead II: Blood Wings‚Äô‚Äù debut on Blu-ray will please fans of the franchise and horror movie buffs. Special appearances by genre regulars like Linnea Quigley and Kane Hodder add to the fun. Although originally a straight-to-video offering when released in 1993, it still fares well in its HD format thanks to good video and audio transfers and a suitable dose of bonus material.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DPU1F64Z5MR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KU3Y5SK#wasThisHelpful","R3DPU1F64Z5MR5","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's evident from the start that these two misfits are out of place in the cul-de-sacs of the suburbs. As the night progresses, things get more and more zany and out of control.Whether John G. Avildsen‚Äôs cinematic adaptation of Thomas Berger‚Äôs best-selling novel ‚ÄúNeighbors‚Äù is cinematic gold is still up for debate 33 years later. Some call it an uneven comedic misfire. Others would claim it to be a foreshadowing of the darkly and quirky genius that would become a popular and respectable sub-genre thanks to Tim Burton‚Äôs rise to fame a few years later.Although ‚ÄúNeighbors‚Äù has Belushi and Aykroyd successfully switching roles, it‚Äôs still a perfect example of the charisma the two had when they paired up together. Belushi would usually play crazy to Aykroyd‚Äôs straight man. However, the two decided to switch parts at the beginning of production for this film. It gives the movie a unique spin that sets it apart from all the other team ‚Äìups the two engaged in.One thing ‚ÄúNeighbors‚Äù does well is suck you into its crazy world. You truly forget it‚Äôs a movie and are taken on a wild ride that unfolds over the period of one Friday night. It gives you that fuzzy buzzy feeling you get when you stay awake all night long after the last day of the work week. The sensation adds to the quirky viewing experience.Although it‚Äôs rated R, ‚ÄúNeighbors‚Äù would achieve nothing above a PG-13 if released today. There‚Äôs quite a bit of profanity and adult content. However, no nudity is found. It‚Äôs tame by today‚Äôs rating standards.‚ÄúNeighbors‚Äù was only re- released on DVD, which will no doubt make many consumers depressed. It‚Äôs still nice to be able to get our hands on a copy of the movie after so many years off the grid. There are no special features included. We can only dream about new interviews with Dan Aykroyd, Cathy Moriarity, and Kathryn Walker about the making of the film and working with Belushi.A new edition of ‚ÄúNeighbors‚Äù is a welcome addition to any film enthusiast‚Äôs library of 1980‚Äôs comedy classics. It captures a unique moment in the careers of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Even without any bonus material or ‚ÄúBehind-the-Scenes‚Äù featurettes, it‚Äôs still worth picking up thanks to an entertainingly dark romp through suburbia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCV2JXTRT5FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU4URM6#wasThisHelpful","RNCV2JXTRT5FF","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should‚Äôve known as soon as the POV footage appeared on my TV what I was in store for after putting ‚ÄúThe Devil Incarnate‚Äù into my DVD player. As if the cover of a baby with horns adorned with a logo featuring an upside-down cross in place of the ‚Äút‚Äù wasn‚Äôt enough of a warning. I love a good possession or religious thriller so I wanted to give it a chance. I‚Äôll need to remember to listen to my instincts next time.Holly (Graci Carli) and Trevor Davidson (Rod Luzzi) are newlyweds on a road trip for their honeymoon. After stopping to have their palms read, Holly begins acting strangely. The announcement that she's pregnant further sets off a chain reaction of bizarre behavior and strange occurrences. Is she suffering from mood swings because of the pregnancy or is there something more sinister at work?The only thing good I have to say about ‚ÄúThe Devil Incarnate‚Äù is that its actors all come across as genuine in their roles. They give the audience no indication that they didn‚Äôt take the movie seriously during production. It‚Äôs a testament to each of them and their individual skills. I felt this needed to be recognized.No sort of Biblical theology is explored in ‚ÄúThe Devil Incarnate.‚Äù There are two possible ‚Äúmessages‚Äù the movie might be trying to convey to viewers. One is that we shouldn‚Äôt get involved in the occult. The other is that the sins of our ancestors will affect us. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt award us any hope that we can break such a generational curse.‚ÄúThe Devil Incarnate‚Äù is not rated, but would hold an ‚ÄúR‚Äù if it were. While there‚Äôs no nudity, it contains enough adult situations and content to push it beyond ‚ÄúPG-13.‚Äù It also includes frightening images and profanity.Many times an anemic independent project like ‚ÄúThe Devil Incarnate‚Äù can gain some sympathy with me if I can see the sort of hard work and passion filmmakers poured into its creation. A ‚ÄúMaking of‚Äù featurette or ‚ÄúBehind the Scenes‚Äù documentary gives a reviewer like myself a chance to experience the blood, sweat, and tears everyone involved in the production put into it. Unfortunately, the DVD contains no special features to help redeem it in my eyes.‚ÄúThe Devil Incarnate‚Äù is the sort of horror film we really don‚Äôt need any more of. Playing like an unholy mash-up of ‚ÄúDrag Me to Hell,‚Äù ‚ÄúRosemary‚Äôs Baby,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Devil Inside,‚Äù it‚Äôs an unnecessary addition to the demon possession and ""found footage‚Äù genres that‚Äôve been overdone lately. There‚Äôs not a shred of originality to be found in its 76-minute running time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P1L4QFEZD99D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LH98Q8Q#wasThisHelpful","R3P1L4QFEZD99D","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated: The Complete Season 2"" collects the last 26 episodes of this highly acclaimed series. I admit it's definitely different from the other shows featuring everybody's favorite crime solving canine. There are way more adult-oriented jokes and witty pop culture nods and winks that most children of the 2000s won't pick up on. However, I still feel it has elements which would appeal to a younger demographic. What's not to like about a Great Dane and his gang of mystery solvers facing off against a different monster every week?In Season Two, Scooby and the gang continue to try and solve the mystery of the Planispheric Disc. As they uncover the secrets surrounding the different pieces of the artifact, new crimes come up that need to be solved. Each clue they uncover along the way gets them closer to the truth behind the mystical Disc.""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated"" is obviously a prequel to ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You?"" Not to give away too much, but they're shown heading out of their hometown of Crystal Cove in the Mystery Machine as the series closes. This leaves the viewer with the feeling that you could put the original 1969 show in your DVD player and the two would fit seamlessly together.After 52 episodes, you'd think we could get some type of extra features for the final episodes of ""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated."" How can there not be any footage of the voice actors recording their parts or animators doing what they do? Couldn't they get the producers, director, or any of the cast members to record commentary for a few of the episodes?""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated: The Complete Season 2"" is a wonderful addition to the library of any fan of the Great Dane's adventures or Hanna-Barbera enthusiasts. The monsters are scary and the mysteries will keep kids wondering who the bad guy in the mask is while laughing at the same time. Fans of all things Hanna-Barbera will love it because it incorporates classic characters from the animation studio's colorful past such as Dr. Benton Quest and Roger ""Race"" Bannon from ""Johnny Quest"" and Dynomutt and the Blue Falcon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T8RDOB5B2VLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9OPKQA#wasThisHelpful","R1T8RDOB5B2VLP","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it was announced that Bryan Singer was returning to the Director‚Äôs Chair for ‚ÄúX-Men: Days of Future Past,‚Äù fanboys and girls everywhere squealed in excitement. Finally, the series was going back into the hands of the man who helped start the whole film franchise. I, on the other hand, groaned and wondered why ‚ÄúFirst Class‚Äù helmsman Matthew Vaughn couldn‚Äôt return to push the story further. It was my favorite entry in the series and took the bad taste out of my mouth created by the mess referred to as ‚ÄúThe Last Stand.‚ÄùIn the distant future, robots known as Sentinels have all but wiped out both mutants and humans. Wolverine is sent by the X-Men to prevent an event which will send history down this path to destruction. First he has to find a way to unite Professor X and Magneto in a search for the harbinger of doom - Mystique.My worries over Singer‚Äôs return to steer the franchise were all realized after the first hour or so of ‚ÄúX-Men: Days of Future Past.‚Äù The first portion of the film moves ahead and sets the viewer up for a powerful and epic thrill ride. Unfortunately, like most of the director‚Äôs movies, it starts to meander and get tedious right after the halfway mark. The action and excitement gets bogged down in a lot of dramatic narrative which feels as if it was injected into the script to make the movie more analytical than it really needed to be.One thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the way the massive amount of cast members and the parts they played in the story were handled. I was concerned when it was announced that the original and new actors who portrayed their respective characters were going to be jammed into one movie. How in the world were filmmakers going to keep the movie from becoming overcrowded and derailing?Director Singer and Screenwriter Simon Kinberg handled the whole affair quite well. Instead of trying to cram as much of a pleasurable thing down our throats as they could, they worked towards the greater good of the whole. They didn‚Äôt play favorites and shove certain popular actors into scenes just to give them more face time.‚ÄúX-Men: Days of Future Past‚Äù is rated PG-13for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action, some suggestive material, nudity, and language. I‚Äôve seen Hugh Jackman‚Äôs butt enough now. Does it really have to be showcased in every one of these films?Although I did enjoy ‚ÄúX-Men: Days of Future Past‚Äù to a certain degree, I felt myself getting lethargic as it moved along towards its inevitable climax. By no means is it a bad movie, but I think it could‚Äôve been better under Matthew Vaughn‚Äôs direction. I do give it props for fully embracing its science fiction roots.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9XB6Z83DMMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7IPFSM#wasThisHelpful","R1C9XB6Z83DMMS","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disney continues its new tradition of unveiling all their classics in digitally restored high-definition with the release of ‚ÄúSleeping Beauty‚Äù in a Diamond Edition. Having been released already in a Blu-ray format, the new version doesn‚Äôt create the same sense of urgency we get when one of the vaulted titles gets its first upgrade. Mouse House devotees will still want to jump up and grab one off store shelves before they disappear.The evil sorceress Maleficent places a curse on Princess Aurora after being slighted by the royal family. She will die by pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel before her 16th birthday. The king puts his daughter in the care of three fairies who take her into hiding to keep the tragedy from occurring. Maleficent becomes obsessed with finding the girl and fulfilling her evil spell.‚ÄúSleeping Beauty‚Äù Diamond Edition is presented in 1080p High-Definition with an aspect ratio of 2.55:1. The digital restoration brings out all the beauty, texture, and depth of the backgrounds and foregrounds for each scene. It‚Äôs gorgeously apparent during the climactic battle sequence between the prince and Maleficent.A 7.1 audio upgrade puts home audiences in the center of all the drama, romance, and action. The movie‚Äôs musical score, strong voice cast, and atmospheric sound effects place us in a fairy tale world you‚Äôll want to re-visit time and time again. It‚Äôs all a perfect accent to the great imagery unfolding before our very eyes.‚ÄúSleeping Beauty‚Äù Diamond Edition comes with a myriad of educating and entertaining bonus material. There are several featurettes focusing on the making of the movie and the talent involved. ‚ÄúBeauty-Oke‚Äù provides children of all ages the opportunity to sing along to their favorite songs from the movie. Three deleted scenes are included as well. Some of the classic special features from the original 2008 Blu-ray release are found as well.I was pleasantly reminded of the dark elegance of Maleficent and the strong gothic overtones presented in ‚ÄúSleeping Beauty.‚Äù They reminded me of the atmosphere found in the underrated ‚ÄúThe Black Cauldron‚Äù and ‚ÄúHunchback of Notre Dame.‚Äù Being a fan of horror movies, I was attracted to the last quarter of the film more so than the first three.Disney collectors and those who never got a chance to get the Platinum Edition of ‚ÄúSleeping Beauty‚Äù will want to rush out and grab a copy of the Diamond Edition immediately. After a window of a month or so, this new version will become scarce and you‚Äôll be hard-pressed to find a copy of it anywhere.

"If there‚Äôs one thing ‚ÄúHalloween: The Complete Collection‚Äù has done for fans, its let them conveniently re-live their favorite movie in the franchise at any given moment in the comfort of their own home. October is one of my favorite times of year because of a certain horror-themed holiday which gives me even more reason to go through the ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù series as furiously as possible. I recently took in Rob Zombie‚Äôs ‚ÄúHalloween II‚Äù after only seeing it once when it was released in 2009.Zombie‚Äôs 2007 remake / reboot / origin story of John Carpenter‚Äôs classic tale took the first half of the film to give us exhaustive information on Michael Myers‚Äô past and his reasons for becoming the cold-blooded killer he turned into. The second part was a rather faithful re-tooling of the original 1978 classic.His ‚ÄúHalloween II‚Äù does the exact same thing as the remake. It loosely takes the storyline from Rick Rosenthal‚Äôs 1981 follow-up to Carpenter‚Äôs masterpiece and runs with it for the first 30 or so minutes before heading in a completely different direction. In a nut shell, Michael Myers is viciously making his way back to Haddonfield to finish the business he started in the first chapter. This time he‚Äôs being led by the specter of his dead mother riding a white horse while leading around a vision of his childhood self. It seems Judith Myers wants Michael to bring his sister Laurie ‚Äúhome.‚ÄùTyler Mane portrays Michael Myers as a coherent demonic force with an unquenchable fury. When he wants someone dead, he sees the job through grunting and viciously thrusting his weapon to the bitter end. Carpenter‚Äôs Myers was more calm and passive in his approach. Although cut from the same cloth, these are two very different versions of the same character.Where the original 1978 film and even its sequel were studies in gore minimalism, Rob Zombie‚Äôs ‚ÄúHalloween II‚Äù revels in its onscreen gruesomeness. From the graphic opening scenes of Laurie Strode being put back together on the operating table to each and every kill performed by Michael Myers, it‚Äôs an exercise in excess blood and guts. Just what audiences crave in their horror films now.Taking in ‚ÄúHalloween II‚Äù for a second time has revealed it‚Äôs not quite as cerebral as I originally thought on first viewing. Don‚Äôt misunderstand me. There‚Äôs way more thought put into the script here than a slasher film really demands, but at its core it‚Äôs still just a modern update of a good old-fashioned stalking killer flick. I still think there are points in the film where it‚Äôs insinuated someone else besides Michael is doing the butchering.‚ÄúHalloween: The Complete Collection‚Äù features the unrated Director‚Äôs Cut of Rob Zombie‚Äôs ‚ÄúHalloween II.‚Äù It‚Äôs 14 minutes longer than the version seen by audiences in the theater. The extended edition is made up of 94 altered scenes including 42 examples of alternative footage and 14 re-cuts. What‚Äôs strange is there‚Äôs no extra violence or sexual situations among any of the unused and amended material.While still a worthy entry into the ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù franchise, Rob Zombie‚Äôs sequel isn‚Äôt quite as fulfilling on a second watch. I remembered it being a whole lot smarter than it really is. It does deserve props for trying to take the slasher genre in a heavier psychological and abstract route. However, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just another entertaining episode in the legend of Michael Myers.Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II: Unrated Director's Cut"" is available now on the ""Halloween: The Complete Collection"" Deluxe and Standard Edition box sets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IX0JZ24RWUFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002V3HT2G#wasThisHelpful","R2IX0JZ24RWUFL","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù fans have a huge reason to be celebrating. In what can only be referred to as a major miracle, nine different movie companies have come together to release the definitive box set for the most important franchise in the slasher genre. ‚ÄúHalloween: The Complete Collection‚Äù hits store shelves just in time to be binge-watched during its namesake‚Äôs holiday season.‚ÄúHalloween: The Complete Collection‚Äù is an exhaustive assemblage of every film in the series and enough special features to keep any horror fan entertained for days. Not only are all ten of the entries in the franchise included, but there are alternate versions of a couple highlighted as well depending on which version of the collection you get.The deluxe edition includes the long sought-after Producer‚Äôs Cut of ‚ÄúHalloween: The Curse of Michael Myers.‚Äù This rare gem is available for the first time ‚Äúlegally‚Äù and features 43 minutes of footage not seen in theaters, which creates a completely different viewing experience than what audiences in 1995 received. An extended cut of John Carpenter‚Äôs original 1978 film made up of footage from the TV edition is found as well. The TV versions of both ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù and ‚ÄúHalloween II‚Äù are also included.The standard release comes with the theatrical cuts of the original eight movies and unrated director‚Äôs cuts of Rob Zombie‚Äôs reboots. ‚ÄúHalloween: The Curse of Michael Myers Producer‚Äôs Cut,‚Äù the ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù and ‚ÄúHalloween II‚Äù TV versions, and the extended ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù aren‚Äôt included in this edition. It‚Äôs perfect for those who just want all the basic films in one neat package.‚ÄúHalloween: The Complete Collection‚Äù is filled with so much bonus material it would take a whole other article to describe them in detail. They include audio commentaries, deleted scenes, alternate endings, behind-the-scenes featurettes, new and vintage cast and crew interviews, TV and radio spots, theatrical trailers, and more. ‚ÄúHorror‚Äôs Hallowed Grounds‚Äù takes audiences back to the filming locations of ‚ÄúHalloween II‚Äù and ‚ÄúHalloween III: Season of the Witch.‚ÄùI don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs really any point for me to even include a breakdown of the ratings for the ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù movies, but here it is for what it‚Äôs worth. Each one has its own measure of violence, bloody images, profanity, nudity, and adult situations. They‚Äôre all an interesting example of where the slasher genre was at the time they were made. 1978‚Äôs ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù is a study in suspense which shows very little onscreen gore. Move ahead to 1989‚Äôs ‚ÄúHalloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers‚Äù and more bloodshed is seen. Rob Zombie‚Äôs versions of Michael Myers are even more graphic in every way to fit in with what genre fans expect in the 2000s.It‚Äôs safe to say that ‚ÄúHalloween: The Complete Collection‚Äôs‚Äù high-definition audio and video transfers for each film beats any previous standard DVD releases. Most have been available on Blu-ray before, but having them all together in one set is where the excitement comes in. They all look and sound great based on the level of restoration they were given.John Carpenter‚Äôs ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù and its sequels deserve to be celebrated because of their impact on the modern slasher and horror genres. ‚ÄúHalloween: The Complete Collection‚Äù helps to remind older audiences of this and educate newer viewers on where movies like ‚ÄúSaw,‚Äù ‚ÄúHatchet,‚Äù and other less potent reboots and remakes of classics come from. It‚Äôs a historical piece celebrating the many faces and eras of the Boogeyman and how he‚Äôs stayed the iconic face of terror for over 35 years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JBW7EQ2DV0XS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDU8G6W#wasThisHelpful","R2JBW7EQ2DV0XS","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the early 1990s, my Friday and Saturday nights were spent at home watching movie after movie of whatever I could find in my local video store. I would first scour the shelves for the newest horror, sci-fi, or action flicks and then move on to older or lesser known titles. Thus, my love affair with Full Moon Features and straight-to-video fare began.I would literally scoop up anything with a Full Moon logo on it and spend hours in the dark of my living room devouring ‚ÄúSubspecies,‚Äù ‚ÄúPuppet Master,‚Äù ‚ÄúDemonic Toys,‚Äù ‚ÄúRobot Jox,‚Äù and anything else I could get my hands on. The ‚ÄúTrancers‚Äù movies were among those B-movie gems I would pick up.Full Moon Entertainment recently released ‚ÄúTrancers: The Ultimate Edition‚Äù on Blu-ray for those of us wanting to relive the dawn of the straight-to-video age and hopefully introduce these priceless films to a whole new generation. Let‚Äôs face it. Without Charles Band and Full Moon Features, there wouldn‚Äôt be the Asylum, SyFy Channel, Anchor Bay, or any other independent genre companies giving us ‚ÄúSharknado,‚Äù ‚ÄúMega Piranha,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMetal Shifters.‚ÄùJack Deth (Tim Thomerson) is an Angel City trooper sent back in time to the Los Angeles of 1985. He is assigned to inhabit the body of his ancestor in order to find his arch-enemy, Whistler (Michael Stefani), who turns people into zombies. Deth must stop him before is able to kill all the ancestors of the members of the future governing council.‚ÄúTrancers: The Ultimate Edition‚Äù is a perfect example of everything Full Moon and Charles Band was creating in the early and mid-1980s. It‚Äôs obvious they saw blockbuster films and wanted to make their own low-budget versions of them for genre fans to enjoy. After all, once you saw ‚ÄúBlade Runner,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Terminator,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTotal Recall,‚Äù where could you get more of those types of entertainment to enjoy? Band and his army of filmmakers filled that niche perfectly.You don‚Äôt get any more 1980s than ‚ÄúTrancers.‚Äù As the director and producer of the movie, Charles Band injected it with as much noir flavor as he could wring out of ‚ÄúBlade Runner‚Äù without being sued for plagiarism. You‚Äôve got the long trench coats with the added flare of shoulder pads. Couple that with weird bolos, shirt collars, and ties and you have a futuristic beat cop ready to take down any zombie or android he comes up against in the past.Let‚Äôs not forget Helen Hunt‚Äôs crazy puffed-up hair and her fixation with punk rock. Just like Kyle Reese in James Cameron‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Terminator,‚Äù Jack Deth somehow makes his way into a nightclub to enjoy some tunes from a bygone era as he pursues his murderous target. Like they say, ‚ÄúImitation is the greatest form of flattery.‚ÄùAlthough ‚ÄúTrancers‚Äù has been remastered in high-definition, the video quality is far from perfect. The picture is still better than it‚Äôs ever looked before, but contains some pops and scratches here and there. It‚Äôs about the best you could expect from a B-movie which was probably not always stored under the best of conditions. It‚Äôs presented with 5.1 stereo surround which will give viewers a more immersive experience when it comes to all the laser fire and environmental sounds you expect from a sci-fi flick.The bonus material for ‚ÄúTrancers: The Ultimate Edition‚Äù will make collectors happy. Audio commentary is provided by Actor Tim Thomerson and Director / Producer Charles Band. Daniel Griffith‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrancers‚Äù featurette and a rare interview with Tim Thomerson, Helen Hunt, and Megan Ward are included. The complete ‚ÄúTrancers: City of Lost Angels‚Äù segment from the anthology film ‚ÄúPulsepounders‚Äù is found as well. It doesn‚Äôt appear to have been cleaned up or remastered at all. A rare still gallery rounds out the special features.‚ÄúTrancers: The Ultimate Edition‚Äù is unrated, but would be worthy of a PG-13 if put before the MPAA. There are some adult situations with no nudity. The language and violence is what you would expect from any genre movie these days.All in all, enthusiasts of 1980s B-movies will love ""Trancers: The Ultimate Edition."" The film is filled with fun practical effects, film noir overtones, and plenty of action for everyone to enjoy. Even with a less than spectacular video transfer, it‚Äôs an essential item for any sci-fi devotee‚Äôs home entertainment library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EK8DDAYNRBD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCDUG8K#wasThisHelpful","R1EK8DDAYNRBD9","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Force is with Disney and Lucasfilm's first major venture together. The two powerhouses held special advanced screenings in select theaters across the country for ""Star Wars Rebels,"" which premieres October 3rd on the Disney Channel. Audience reactions to what they saw was unanimously positive and with good cause. The show completely captures the spirit and youthful charm of the original 1977 classic that started it all.The 50-minute sneak preview shown in theaters across the country was titled ‚ÄúStar Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion.‚Äù It takes place between the events of ‚ÄúEpisodes III‚Äù and ‚ÄúIV‚Äù and introduces a band of rebels who man the space vessel Ghost. They make it their life mission to foil the Galactic Empire‚Äôs plans of galactic domination. Fourteen year old orphan Ezra Bridger reluctantly joins former Padawan Kanan Jarrus, pilot Hera Syndulla, Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren, Lasat warrior Zeb Orrelios, and astromech droid Chopper on a rescue mission to the spice mines of Kessel to free a group of Wookiee slaves. Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau leads his stormtroopers in pursuit of the motley crew.You can tell that the producers of ‚ÄúStar Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion‚Äù listened to uptight fans of anything related to the prequel trilogy when taking in to consideration the direction they wanted to head in for the new series. Personally, I enjoy everything ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù and didn‚Äôt have any problem with ‚ÄúThe Clone Wars‚Äù or ‚ÄúEpisodes I‚Äù through ‚ÄúIII.‚ÄùThe echoes of ‚ÄúStar Wars ‚Äì Episode IV: A New Hope‚Äù are very much evident here. We have a young man yearning for something more from life than his aimless existence on a forgotten world in the outer rim of a galaxy far, far away. We get a band of misfits from all corners of the universe taking the boy in and giving him direction. Add to that the evil establishment who wants to rule everyone with an iron fist. It‚Äôs just like all great tales of adventure and heroism, but with different characters and settings. Let‚Äôs just call it what it is: ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù revamped for a new generation.Familiar spaceships and figures from the original ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù trilogy no doubt makes longtime fans comfortable as they take in ‚ÄúSpark of Rebellion.‚Äù TIE Fighters race through space and stormtroopers follow their uniformed superiors around as they bark orders at them. The exterior and interior of the Star Destroyers also mirror the images embedded into our psyche by ‚ÄúThe Empire Strikes Back.‚ÄùThe animation style utilized for ‚ÄúStar Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion‚Äù is very much similar to that of ‚ÄúThe Clone Wars.‚Äù They‚Äôve obviously moved forward with leaps and bounds when it comes to the depth, texturing, and movements of the human characters. It‚Äôs also evident that the work of original trilogy concept artist Ralph McQuarrie‚Äôs handiwork was a huge influence on the design of the show. The evidence of that can be seen immediately in the character of Zeb, whose appearance is based on the original design of the Wookies.The musical score for ‚ÄúStar Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion‚Äù also differs greatly from that of ‚ÄúThe Clone Wars.‚Äù It‚Äôs a return to the classic sounds of John Williams‚Äô symphonic work that makes audiences want to stand up and clap in excitement every time it‚Äôs heard. Composer Kevin Kiner is the talent behind the series, but it sounds like he‚Äôs taking all of Williams‚Äô work and just rearranging it to fit new sequences of peril and drama.‚ÄúStar Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion‚Äù is Lucasfilm and Disney trying to meet the needs and expectations of three very different generations all at the same time. Returning to the original formula a young and enthusiastic film geek named George Lucas introduced the world to 37 years ago was obviously the correct direction to journey in.

"DC Comics characters continue to rule the television world and the proof is in ‚ÄúArrow: The Complete Second Season‚Äù Blu-ray and DVD sets. Every actor in the cast is invested in their role and strives to provide quality entertainment in each episode. The fight choreography creates some of the greatest action sequences ever seen in super hero movies and TV. Good writing doesn‚Äôt hurt when it comes to keeping audiences engaged week after week, either.After the Glades are ravaged by the Undertaking, Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) retreats to the island he was stranded on for so many years. Arrow is unable to face the citizens and friends he feels he‚Äôs failed. At the plea of Diggle (David Ramsey) and Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards), he returns to discover Starling City is worse off than ever. Oliver finds himself pitted against old and new villains alike as he struggles to fend off evil and protect those he loves.The Blu-ray edition of ‚ÄúArrow: The Complete Second Season‚Äù is presented in 1080p High-Definition 16x9 (1.78.1) coupled with DTS-HD MA: English 5.1 audio. The video quality is flawless and gives viewers no reason to be distracted from all the action and excitement taking place onscreen. The surround sound puts you right in the middle of the jungles of the island and the noisy streets of Starling City.Those who love bonus material will be impressed with ‚ÄúArrow: The Complete Second Season‚Äù Blu-ray set. A bonus recap episode reminds viewers of the events of the first season. Three featurettes entitled ‚ÄúFrom Vigilante to Hero,‚Äù ‚ÄúHow Did They Do That? The Visual Effects of ‚ÄòArrow,‚Äô‚Äù and ‚ÄúWirework: The Impossible Moves of ‚ÄòArrow‚Äô‚Äù take us behind the scenes of the show. Unaired scenes, a gag reel, and the ‚ÄúArrow‚Äù 2013 Comic-Con Panel complete the special features.‚ÄúArrow: The Complete Second Season‚Äù is unrated, even though it would merit a PG-13 if put before the MPAA. There‚Äôs a whole lot of violence and bloodshed when our hooded vigilante comes face-to-face with the criminals who cross him. Some adult situations and mild language are found as well.If you‚Äôre not watching ‚ÄúArrow‚Äù already, you need to be. Strong scripting, great acting, and breakneck pacing make it an experience you don‚Äôt want to miss. Marvel might be the Kings of the Cinema right now when it comes to compact two hour super hero tales. However, DC reigns supreme if you‚Äôre looking for longevity and complex dramas that keep your attention for the long haul.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32SUN0F70C8JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZP0MI4#wasThisHelpful","R32SUN0F70C8JC","ADWQPR0LJD4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADWQPR0LJD4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"DO NOT BUY unless you pay for 1-3 mbs internet! I have charter internet and pay for 60 mbs! I bought this one to replace my TP LInk router in hopes to get more consistent 40-60 mbs internet. Well I was fooled. This router was on sale and was really cheap. There was a reason why! It is because this is the worst router ever! Connection speed was slow. It kept on disconnecting. It was NOT RELIABLE. I will list my PROS and CONS with this router.PROS:+Easy to connect, with an easy password to remember.CONS:+SLOW---AND I MEAN REALLY REALLY SLOW! Get this if you already have slow internet, do not get this if you are expecting super high speed fast internet.+Unreliable--the number of times I had to restart the router because the connection was lost is incredible. I wasted so much time trying to fix it than using the actual internet.+SLOW--Dnt let those two antennas fool you into thinking it will be super fast.+CHEAP LOOKING AND FEELS CHEAPOverall, DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS ROUTER. Even the cheaper TP-Link that is usually #1 on Amazon is faster. You seriously get what you pay for and it is definitely not worth the time and effort. Trust me do not waste your time and money on this! I ultimately, returned this item and the Netgear Range Extender and bought the high end TP-Link router worth about $100 and it is way better. I didn't even need the range extender anymore. I just needed a good new router.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TFPRDMW4DG2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVJYEI#wasThisHelpful","R2TFPRDMW4DG2L","A118N144IM71JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A118N144IM71JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is literally the best invention ever! I mainly use it for my Ikea side table. I have a iPhone lightening cable and I use the Cordies to keep my charging cable in place instead of it constantly falling to the ground after unplugging my iPhone. The cordies is such cool and amazing solution to keep wires from falling to the ground from a desk or side table. I wish I had found this sooner! I will list my PROS and CONS to help you get a better sense of this product.PROS:+It gets the job done. It securely holds my lightening cable wire for my iPhone & iPad in place on my ikea side table.+It can be used anywhere, whether it be a side table or a desk.+Comes in fun colors to match any decor!+Really stable and heavy so it doesn't get pulled around.CONS:-The quality of it seems a bit cheap, as in there are some sharp edges. This is probably due to the molding.-The cordies in the teal color does not match in real life. It is a much lighter teal color than the darker blue teal in the image.Overall, the CONS aren't to bad that will prevent me from buying this again. It is a very helpful solution to keeping my lightening cable in place on my nightstand. Be aware that there are a lot of fake ones out there. I bought my directly from Amazon ""Shipped and sold by Amazon"" to ensure that I was getting the Authentic Cordies from Quirky. Don't be fooled by the cheaper version! It is not the same! You will definitely get what you pay for if you buy the cheaper alternative. Overall, I will highly recommend this to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32C78ADKH0CAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU6GOF0#wasThisHelpful","R32C78ADKH0CAR","A118N144IM71JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A118N144IM71JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The design is printed onto the case, which is a bit bad as it will wear out and start to fade away over time.

"The quality of their Galaxy S6 case is not the same as the iPhone 6. The Galaxy S6 case that I received the bottom gold part is very loose and does not stay with the other half. I push really hard to have it stay attached to the other piece. I have resorted to putting on tape so that it doesn't fall off. This case is pretty and durable. However, it gets dirty fast! Maybe it is because of the light color? Or maybe the material it is made of. I would not recommend the Galaxy S6 Vibrance Series case to anyone.

"I have been on the hunt for the perfect GoPro case to house my GoPro and the many different accessories that I own. I recently got back from my trip across Europe. I have used this GoPro case from Smatree for the past month and this is surely the best case I have ever owned. It is super durable and holds a lot of different accessories. I found that I could fit all my accessories into this case in a breeze.Throughout my trip I was constantly on the go. I found that the outer clip was extremely helpful as I would attach it to my backpack so it would not get lost. In addition, My GoPro sticks fit into the compartment perfectly.I will list my PROS and CONS for this case.PROS:+So many compartments!--this is the only GoPro case you will ever need as it fits everything!+Durability--this case stayed in tacked throughout a month long trip backpacking in Europe. The zippers all worked and my GoPro stayed safe in the compartments.+Size--the case is large enough to fit all my accessories, but not so huge that it takes up so much space and can't fit into my backpack/luggage+Weight--the Styrofoam compartments make this case lightweight and easy to carry, while still protecting the case.CONS:-It does not fit all GoPro sticks--of course it fits Smatree brand GoPro sticks, and it fit my GoPro brand selfie stick.Overall, this is a solid, durable, reliable case. I can fit all my accessories and not have to worry about them getting damaged. I am interested in buying another set just to include more of my GoPro accessories. My GoPro and accessories survived a month long trip in Europe. I am sure this is the best GoPro case on the market.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NUJB91CHR1Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFCRKJM#wasThisHelpful","R1NUJB91CHR1Y3","A118N144IM71JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A118N144IM71JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this selfie stick the easiest and most reliable to operate. Connecting to Bluetooth was a breeze. I have an iPhone 6 and I just followed the step by step instructions of how to connect to Bluetooth. Another great factor for this selfie stick is the overall built quality. This stick compared to others is more sturdy and not heavy. It surely becomes a workout when holding up selfie stick, however with this selfie stick it isn't the case.The biggest flaw that I saw with this selfie stick was that the button pressing lagged in correspondence to the actual camera. Maybe it was my Bluetooth connection? The button itself? The actual selfie stick? It is hard to determine, but it is easy to get used to it, so I do not mind it at all. So if your looking for the easiest to use selfie stick in the market, this is the one for you.**Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GPDIA2LBFSMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9ESIZQ#wasThisHelpful","R3GPDIA2LBFSMF","A118N144IM71JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A118N144IM71JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for the case that will provide ultimate protection and top quality texture then you have found the one!Upon opening the case from the packaging my first impression of the case was the color. It's color accurately matches the image on Amazon. Also, the texture of the case feels amazing in the hands! I have full on grip of the case because of the material used. I absolutely love the material they use as it is not slippery at all.Thought on the case after spending a month with it:1.) the textured grip is amazing. I never had to worry about my phone slipping out of my hands.2.) fits the phone perfectly. It's easy to remove the case and put it back on.3.) I haven't dropped the phone from a high distance but I have chucked it and it seems fine.4.) it does get stained easily.Overall, I believe that this case is amazing and has excellent grip.

"I just got back from my 20 day trip to Australia with this Sandmarc Travel Bundle. This is the most comprehensive and best travel bundle for traveling. It consists of everything you need for your gopro while traveling. I have the GoPro Hero 4 Silver edition and it works great and is compatible with every accessory that came with this bundle back. I will list my pros and cons about this travel bundle.PROS:+The travel bundle comes with every accessory one would need in order to travel. The accessories are made out of good strong material and feels very sturdy.+The travel pack is very useful and handles the accessories really carefully.+you get all the accessories you need for a great bundle price. If you were to buy it separately it would be more costly.CONS:-The gopro pole is quite heavy. It is made of sturdy heavy metal and can get heavy when trying to hold it up high. Also, I can see the pole getting rusty in the future from use in the water.-The floating handle is somewhat slippery. I wish there was more grip to it.Overall, I feel like the PROs outways all the CONS. This travel bundle is worth it and from first hand experience while traveling through Australia, I found this bundle to be extremely helpful during my adventurous times.

"A $70 remote?! Is it worth it?! NO. For the whopping price of $70 you get an overpriced remote that your smart phone with a GoPro app can easily do. The reason why I bought this because I wanted to use this instead of using the app especially when traveling internationally. Don't get me wrong, it works well, but it is way to overpriced. The buttons work exactly how they work on the actual GoPro. It is pretty light weight and somewhat durable. Overall, I would not really recommend this to anyone if they dnt use it for international travel. I would recommend this for people who travel internationally, want to take pics in the water, or who want to use it during adventurous activities and do not want to risk breaking your phone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8WGO8E4TRAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIYNU8E#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8WGO8E4TRAJ","A118N144IM71JN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A118N144IM71JN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cheap feeling, but amazing sound quality. I know it sounds like an oxymoron, but this exactly describes these headphones. In your hands, these headphones feel cheap and plastic like that can easily break, but when you put it on your ears and listen to sounds such as music it sounds pretty incredible for bluetooth headphones. These headphones were easy to connect to bluetooth. I will list my PROS and CONSPROS:+incredible sound quality--compared to bose they are pretty good at its price range.+easy connection to bluetooth--this is extremely important factor in that connection to bluetooth needs to be fast and easy+feels good around the head and ears--the material feels comfortable around my ears+lightweight--it is not too heavy and will not hurt your head after hours of usage.CONS:-cheap build quality--these headphones feel super cheap. I feel like I can easily break them by accidentally dropping it onto the ground.-okay battery life--the battery life was not that great, im not sure if I just got a bad unit?-expensive for the quality--I do not think the quality is worth the price, maybe the sound technology is worth the price, but not the aesthetics and feel of it.Overall, these headphones are great if your interested in sound quality more than aesthetics and feel of your headphones. I believe that the sound quality compromises for the cheap build quality, which is why I did not rate it 4 stars.

" 1:56 Mins This lunch bag is actually a very good size in comparison to many of the others I have used. What's unique about this one is that it is tall enough to fit my stainless steel water bottles in the bag.The dimensions are roughly 15"" by 7"" by 10.5"" tall. It is flexible so can squeeze slightly bigger things if you want. It is insulated, so will update once I've had adequate time to determine how good the insulation is. The bag appears to be made well and looks much better in person.It is made from 75% polyester, 15% foam, and 10% PEVA which stands for Poly-Ethylene-vinyl acetate, it is probably added to keep the bag protected from UV light, and to keep it soft and pliable. PEVA is usually what your hot glue sticks are made out of and sometimes added to make your plastic wrap clingy. Do I want it in my lunch? Nope, but I put my lunch in other containers before I put it in the lunch bag.A free sample was provided in exchange for an honest review - update on keeping things cold is still pending...Update 10/19/15:I have been using this for work, and so far so good as far as keeping things cold.

It appears to offer accurate readingsAlthough this is my second choice, I found that when I'm just checking a quick temperature, I don't need the thermometer with all the bells and whistles, and this one does the job very well.Overall I'm very happy with this thermometer, and will post an update should anything change.A free sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DNGJS6W67IHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJ07PVA#wasThisHelpful","R2DNGJS6W67IHC","A3U7HTT0PO0IAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HTT0PO0IAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:11 Mins In the video, I compared three different thermometers, and tested them at a higher temperature than what you would normally use them for for meat.There are many advantages of the ThermoPro TP-04 Large LCD Display All-In-One oven Thermometer over the others, and these include:Constant monitoring of your meat while it is cooking.Alarm to notify you when desired temperature is reached, so you don't over cook.Cheat sheet right on the unit to remind you of what temperatures you need based on different meats.Appears to show a more accurate temperature.Added timer.Of the three thermometers that I tried, this is my top choice, though you might not need something so technical if you just need to check a quick temperature.Overall I'm very happy with this thermometer, and will post an update if anything changes.A free sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GKQP9O4NV3Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YX9BTKE#wasThisHelpful","R1GKQP9O4NV3Q3","A3U7HTT0PO0IAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HTT0PO0IAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use a lot of essential oils, and I know that many of them are cut with other oils to make it appear like you have more. While I am not an expert in essential oils, I'm not new to the game either. With that said, I find this French lavender oil of exceptional quality.I especially like that nothing is hidden, they tell you the botanical name (lavandula x intermedia) right on the bottle. They tell you what it's generally used for, method of extraction (steam distilled), and country of origin (France).As far as quality goes, this essential oil is extremely potent, and by that I mean that I use only a fraction of what some other essential oil brands required to get the same effect.I'm extremely happy with this essential oil","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35VNR2G21PF2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N78I6HQ#wasThisHelpful","R35VNR2G21PF2I","A3U7HTT0PO0IAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HTT0PO0IAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 5:59 Mins Overall the sound from this speaker is of exceptional quality. Please note that the sound in the video is limited to my camera's ability to pick up sound, and also your computer's speakers. I hope that my comparison of my old speaker was at least a little bit of help.The Pros:1. Sound is exceptional.2. Easy to use, and easy to remember how to use.3. Classy sleek look.4. The charge keeps for a long time (will update once have solid numbers).5. Easy to charge.6. Not too big while still offering good sound, especially if using a computer to play the sound.The cons:If using wired:1. The hook up was a challenge as the wire that connects the speaker to the player is directional, at least mine is, so you have to  make sure you plug it in correctly. Since making the video, I marked my wire so I know which end is which.2. I can't charge and listen at the same time when using wired (I can't imagine this would be the case if utilizing blue tooth technology - but can't test that).3. The cords are white with a black unit, so they stand out just a little. Not a big deal if using bluetooth and not charging as it can stand alone.General info:1. The cord to connect that speaker to the player is 39"" not including the ends.2. The charging USB code is 29"" not including the ends.3. To turn unit on, just hold down the encoder. Same to turn off.4. To mute (if wired) or pause (if bluetooth), just push the encoder, same to un-mute/un-pause.5. To fast forward a song push the encoder twice, to back up a song push the encoder 3 times (only if using bluetooth).I am extremely pleased with this speaker. Due to the wonderful sound quality I found myself listening to music rather than writing reviews. I will make sure to post any updates should anything change.I received a free sample in exchange for an unbiased review.Update 08/31/15:I received the following email in response to my review:""There is a detail we want to explain for you.In the review, you mention that the speaker can not charge and listen at the same time when using wired.In fact, the speaker can do it. You just need to charge it on the outlet not into the computer USB port. The attachment is the detail, please check it.""Sure enough, if I plug the USB charging cord into another unit to charge, such as a USB charge port, the unit can both play and charge at the same time. I decided to bump up the stars both due to the prompt customer service, and also due to the offer of a solution to a problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FPSCRBZA9GVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WMC6BS#wasThisHelpful","R2FPSCRBZA9GVM","A3U7HTT0PO0IAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HTT0PO0IAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:47 Mins The idea of keeping your personal belongings, such as cash, ID, credit cards, etc., in an area that is not as easily accesible for the common thief, should really be more popular. A wallet in a back pocket is an easy target, and a purse equally so.Using a bag that can be kept concealed under garments is really a wonderful idea, and this little bag is a nice option. Offers the option to use an expandable strap or a belt loop. Has two pockets to separate items, and a loop to hang your keys on.The RFID feature is a nice bonus, but I'm not convinced yet, so I'm going to test it using my key card that utilizes RFID technology. I'm going to put my card in the bag and see if I can unlock the door. I will post an update once I have done this.A free sample was provided in exchange for an unbiased review.Update 08/26/15:I finally had an opportunity to test the RFID protection claims. I put my RFID based key card in this bag, and went to see if I could still open a door using the card through the bag. Not even a hesitation.

" 1:15 Mins What you get is a pair of nail clippers, and a nail file. Together they work great to trim your dog's nails, followed by a quick file to smooth up sharp edges. That's a nice touch if you're someone like me where you allow your dog on your furniture, and their freshly cut nails catch on the fabric of your couch.Overall, the clippers seem to perform fine on nails, sharp enough to get it with one swift cut. So why not five stars?While most dog owners know how to clip their pets nails, many new dog owners might not. So it's always nice to have instructions on how to use a tool, especially if it can lead to harm to your pet. Not only was there no instructions on how to use on your dog, but also no explanation of the functions of the tool. I realize it's a standard nail clipping tool, but not everyone is familiar with them, so instructions are always nice. It's also nice to get reminders, like how to identify where the quick is on your pets nail, so you don't cut into that and result in accidental bleeding, not to mention pain for your pet. it's just nice to have something on paper that validates what you're about to do.A free sample was provided in exchange for an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AXMADPIIFSAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010I24S16#wasThisHelpful","R3AXMADPIIFSAP","A3U7HTT0PO0IAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HTT0PO0IAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:53 Mins These bird repellent disks can do wonders if used correctly, and by that, I mean that you'll need quite a number of them.First, putting them together is easy, attach some rings, a hook, remove the plastic cover, and done.The hard part is figuring out where to hang them. The goal here is to freak out the wild birds by making them see reflections that will scare them off. This has it's own challenges, including setting up in an area where a problem already persists.I found that when used as a preventative measure, it keeps the birds from inviting themselves in, however, if the birds are already established, hanging up one or even two of these, will do nothing for the problem.The best way these can be used is as a preventative is by hanging up several of these in the area that you don't want birds. Make a circle of these to keep the center prize out. After a week, move them around! This is the most important step. The birds get used to these tricks, and learn to ignore them, the best way to keep up with it, is to keep them guessing if it's a trick or a real threat. Fortunately the hook that comes with these is mendable to a certain degree.My experiment consisted of splitting these in half. I took the first half of my assembled disks and put them in an area that was already compromised by the wild birds, and I took the other half to an area that was not yet compromised, but expected any minute it would be due to the delicious and tempting plant life that was coming to life. The results? In the bird established area, the bird attacks only reduced by about 30%. Not bad if you ask me, but not good enough. In the future bird attack area, not a single bird was sighted, not a one. So it would appear to me, that these disks work best as a preventative rather than a solution.Of note, the disks work best when they are no more than three feet apart from each other, in a small area. If you have acreage, you might be looking at purchasing a large number of these.A free sample was provided in exchange for an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C5FCDUG9SQ5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011NQWNQI#wasThisHelpful","R1C5FCDUG9SQ5J","A3U7HTT0PO0IAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HTT0PO0IAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:55 Mins This watch is a very nice gift that is unique not only with the design, but also with the fact that it is a wind up watch. These are hard to find now-a-days, and so it makes it very unique.The style is very nice, setting/adjusting the time is easy to do. Winding up takes a little getting used to, and I'm still trying to figure out how long the watch will run before it's critical to wind up again.So far I have noticed that it does run a tad slow, about 5 min in 24 hours. that's not too bad, but in a week's time, that's a half hour off. Pretty serious if you're a punctual person. Thus the 3 stars.I'm going to keep watching it and comparing it to the actual time, and see how it does over time. I'll update my review as I learn more.A free sample was provided in exchange for an unbiased review.Update 08/24/15:I fully wound the watch at 8am yesterday and let it go to see how long it will last on one winding. The watch completely stopped at 12:10pm today. So almost 28 hours. I'll keep checking it to see if it's consistent. On the flip side, the watch seemed to keep better time this time around, maybe it just needed to be used? I'll keep tabs on it and post an update as appropriate.Update 08/26/15:I decided to see what happens if I wind the watch every 12 hours, rather than 24+. So far, the watch keeps consistent time. I think the trick here might be to wind itKU6WN6HH twice a day rather than once a day. Yes, more work in the long run, who wants to remember to wind their watch twice a day, but so far this seems to be a good solution to keeping time without electricity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9DY0TOQIKJY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZHRO44E#wasThisHelpful","R9DY0TOQIKJY9","A3U7HTT0PO0IAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HTT0PO0IAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first received my kitchen silverware drawer organizer I was excited and couldn't wait to unwrap it and re-organize my drawer. I love bamboo products, as it is a natural and renewable resource, and I find I enjoy the bamboo look in my kitchen. This expandable drawer was going to be a very nice touch.However, upon closer inspection, I noticed it had a coating on it of some sort, and there was a single sheet of product description and cleaning instructions included. On the cleaning instructions, it states that ""if the bamboo starts to 'look tired' we suggest to apply any food safe mineral oil to board."" I immediately decided to contact the manufacturer and inquire what this was coated with.I was extremely disappointed to find out that this ""top quality organically 100% natural Eco-friendly bamboo"" is coated with lacquer. It was not specified what type of lacquer, but it wouldn't matter. I wouldn't put lacquer in my mouth, ever, so I won't be using this as a silverware drawer.I was going to give this two stars instead of one, simply for the ingenuity of the design, however, I was able to find a second use for it, and this drawer organizer has now graduated to the garage, and because the sides expand and contract, I was able to add this to one of my cabinet drawers and it is now keeping all my nuts and bolts organized.I realize that staining with natural oils such as walnut oil can be extremely expensive, but if anything, the manufacturer should at least offer a non-coated version so that  buyer can choose for themselves if they want to coat their bamboo with a protective layer.

"If you like to cook from scratch, and prefer using ingredients that are fresh, having a quick and easy to grab hand grinder is a must. What I like about this hourglass 2 in 1 salt and pepper grinder, is that it has a very unique look, doesn't take up much space, but keeps a descent amount of raw material ready for grinding.I don't care for pepper all that much, so don't bother with it, but I do use one end for my Himalayan salt crystals, and the other end for my xylitol which I use as a sweetener. The gears area adjustable, so I was able to set them to grind at the fineness that I prefer for each side, and now have a handy tool in the kitchen for quick access to add my two favorite ingredients.I gave it four stars instead of five for two reasons. One, the part that I wish was glass is acrylic. I much prefer glass and would be thrilled if a glass version came out, and two, it would be nice if it came with a hook of some sort that would allow you to hang this on the wall.

I just plug in the USB end of the kindle charging cord to the car charger, and the other end to the kindle, and the kindle indicates it's charging, allowing me to use it.I would like a way to remove the permanent cord that has the plug for the iphone, but it's not that big of a a deal.A free samples was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26WH3KYOHIOPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJ7A9EG#wasThisHelpful","R26WH3KYOHIOPI","A3U7HTT0PO0IAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HTT0PO0IAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my mind, if you're someone that is storing food for whatever emergency, then you are someone that also cares about surviving an emergency, and to do so, you should be in optimal health. While I realize that our current education system does a horrible job or explaining proper nutrition, there is not a lack of resources to learn such for oneself.With that said, I find that proper nutrition should be included in every food storage book, as that is part of survival. Unfortunately, the recommendations in this book of what you should store are sadly lacking in proper nutrition, especially the vegetable aspect. While you might survive on beans and potatoes, you will not be in the best of shape, nor will you be able to function at your best.I was extremely disappointed that just about every recipe in the beans, soups and stews section called for a large amount of potatoes. That's great if you're a potato eater, but if you choose not to eat them because they are extremely unhealthy for you, then most of the recipes do not apply to you.  The wheat section has many creative recipes, but again, if you eat nothing but wheat, you are depriving yourself many nutritious ingredients. There is no mention in this book about supplementing with a multi-vitamin, which you absolutely would have to if this is all you ate. And the fact that there is not a section in using your dehydrated vegetables, or even canned vegetables, is extremely disappointing, especially since there is a snacks and treats section.If you are a meat and potatoes person, along with lots of bread and crackers and such, then these recipes may do you well, though I can't say if they taste good as I eat just about none of the ingredients from this book. If you are a health nut, or someone who doesn't care to add pork to every recipe, then this book will not work for you by any means. I also have no idea how the author determined the amounts of these foods to store per person. The author actually suggests that you store 40 lbs of sugar per adult! 40 lbs!!! And that's per adult. And how much vegetables should you store? As per family needs? Unbelievable.Sure, this book will help you store food and survive an emergency, but you'll die from a heart attack shortly after.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHHELXEBDS6T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598118552#wasThisHelpful","RHHELXEBDS6T4","A3U7HTT0PO0IAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HTT0PO0IAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:20 Mins This aroma diffuser does a wonderful job or helping to give your home a scent of your choice. There are various essential oils you can use, such as lavender to calm the mood, or even citronella on your porch to keep the mosquitos away. You do not have to use any scenting oils, and can use it as just a simple diffuser as well. However, do note, that this requires power, and does come with a power cord.  So don't let the picture fool you, I did let it fool me, regardless, I'm still extremely happy with the diffuser.Instructions are plentiful, including troubleshooting instructions. You basically open the top by unscrewing just slightly, (a little clumsy at first until you get used to it), then take off the cover. Add water in your measuring cup that is included, then add 3 to 5 drops of essential oil of your choice. Place the lid over the water, followed by the cover which has notches that align with the bottom. This is actually kind of tricky as the lid is very smooth and round, and you have to keep the unit on a level surface once the water is in since really don't want to get water in certain parts of the diffuser.You have a couple indicator lights which tell you the unit is plugged in, and that it's functioning properly (labeled as W and P retrospectively). You also have two buttons, an on/off button labeled as ""M"" for mist, that allows you start the unit by pushing it once, turn to the second mode by pushing it a second time, or to stop by pushing a 3rd time. The second button labeled as ""L"" for light, allows you to change the mood light from automatic changing colors (what it defaults to), to a solid color of your choice, or completely off.The machine powers off by itself when it runs out of water, so you don't have to worry about watching it. Cleaning is simple but don't get the power cord wet obviously, and don't use any abrasive cleaners to clean with nor would you want to submerge this under running water. Just use a damp cloth with maybe a little gentle dish-soap. Takes a little bit to get used to opening and closing the lid, but otherwise it's great. I only gave it 4 stars because the box is deceptive and implies you don't need a power cord, which you do need a power supply (100-240V/50-60hz), which is included. The cord is roughly 54-55"" in length.It looks very classy and is small enough that it won't dominate any space you might assign to it. Just that darned power cord...As always, I'm happy to answer any questions.A free samples was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AN82PX2HJZAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9M2D3S#wasThisHelpful","R1AN82PX2HJZAL","A3U7HTT0PO0IAO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U7HTT0PO0IAO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:20 Mins These garden stakes come in a pack of 100, so you get plenty to make sure all your favorite plantings are identified.As shown in the video, these garden tabs are plastic, but the end that goes into the ground is slightly reinforced via a bend in the center, giving it a little more strength. The plastic is very easy to write on with a sharpie.There's plenty of room if you needed to include additional information, such as variety, or date (the writing area measures almost 2 1/2"" wide by slightly over 1"" tall.I was able to remove 90% of the sharpie writing by using rubbing alcohol, but so far nothing else has removed the writing.

"I ordered this as christmas gift for a friend of mine who had been wanting a trapper hat for quite some time. When it came in the mail I tried it one to see if the fit was any good. To my dismay it is a bit too large for my average sized heat so it seems that the hat was made for people with larger heads in mine. But I ended up stuffing a beanie in to make it tighter and what do you know that seemed to do the trick. I will just let my friend know that she might have to stuff something in before wearing to make it fit properly. A minor nuisance that I would prefer not to have altogether. The color is true to the one in the picture and the quality is quite great. However, the clip in the bottom is quite terrible and low quality so that is something to definitely mention. I love the suede feel of the hat however and I wish that I would have bought one for myself. In the end even with its nuisances, this is a great trapper hat. If you can overlook the problems that it has, you will definitely be satisfied with your purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JG76YVHJX277/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XDU0GO#wasThisHelpful","R2JG76YVHJX277","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a free unit of this device in exchange for an honest review and I want to emphasize that al opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way shape or formLong story short these earbuds for the price were passable for me. The sound was what you would expect it to be from an $15 and under pair of earbuds. The bass is underwhelming which to me was a bit of a disappointment but on the other hand the mids were present and quite decent. The highs were little too sharp for me and did often get somewhat tinny in certain songs. There was a bit of muddiness to the sound overall but not to the point where it made the listening experience bad. These are not bad sounding headphones at all but for an audiophile like me, I tend to want a bit more. For the everyday casual listener who wants a cheap pair of buds, these are great. They are versatile and quite comfortable as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2902N9XQIJGRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OF0IDI#wasThisHelpful","R2902N9XQIJGRV","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a free unit of this device in exchange for an honest review and I want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way________DESIGN: The design of this neckband is similar to all the others in the market at the moment. This one in particular does have a little bit of added glitter to it that I did not notice in the product picture on the amazon page. Unfortunately the glossy/ shiny design of the device is still prone to fingerprints like many neckbands out there but of course no one will notice that unless they take the neckband in their hands and observe it themselves._________DURABILITY: The construction of the neckband here is actually a lot better than a lot of the other neckbands that I have reviewed recently. Most neckband have the back are that sits on the neck be quite flexible and flimsy but this one in particular is made of a hard plastic and a lot more rigid. I actually enjoy this design choice because it increases the durability of the neckband itself. The retracting mechanism is an ABSOLUTE monster. Once you click it in place, it retracts the earbuds very quickly back to its resting position. I am very impressed with the quality of the retracting mechanism. Unfortunately for me however, I found that the wires attached to the earbuds are way too thin for my tastes. Whenever I extent them from the housing to increase its length, I am extremely concerned about damaging the wires since they are so thin. They literally feel like they are about to break every moment that I pull on them.____________BLUETOOTH: Connectivity is a breeze and took only a matter of seconds to set up. This neckband has by far been the audio device that has the longest bluetooth range out of all my devices. They even far out competed my $200 Sony XB950BT headset and I even managed to walk around my whole house without having a problem with drops in connectivity. I am extremely impressed with its bluetooth range. Call quality is excellent and I had no issues with that either._____________SOUND: The sound here is excellent for the price as well. Bass is present although I would prefer it to be a little more punchy but overall it is quite great for the average consumer. The mids and highs are present as well and they sound pretty smooth throughout all the tracks I used to determine the sound quality. There was no muddiness nor tinny sounds when listening to music and overall they delivered pleasant sound._____________CONCLUSION: This neckband has the whole package but with one major drawback. The thinness of the wires is my primary concern as far as longevity and that is why I took off one star. It is such a great headset but I feel this one flaw might shorten its longevity greatly. Please keep this in mind when determining whether or not to buy this neckband.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C3SPINYKJF4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017OUEU1I#wasThisHelpful","R3C3SPINYKJF4K","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"* I received a free unit from the company in exchange for an honest review and I want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way shape or form.___________________DESIGN: The design of this headset is edgy albeit a little generic but I can look over that. It still looks pretty cool and the blue light that emits looks absolutely stunning in the dark. It really is an eye catcher. The top headpiece is comfortable and adjusts to the head size that you have. The ear caps provide great insulation giving comfort to your ears and keeping outside noises out. You can wear these for hours and not have a problem with it. My favorite design choice however is the microphone piece. When not in use, you can snap it into the indentation of the ear cup and it will loo like there wasn't a microphone extension in the first place. Very stealthy and I like it very much. However, the primary concern that I have is the fact that the material is black plastic. These guys catch fingerprints like no ones business so please be aware of that._____________DURABILITY: The headset itself feels really good in the hand. It's heavy and has a lot of give to it. The construction is solid despite the plastic build. The wire is thick and reinforced. It feels good handling the wire because you can really tell that they are really sturdy. I am happy in the durability department and I expect this to last at least a year.______________SOUND QUALITY: For the price this headset is well worth is. I compared these to my $200 Sony XB950BT's and it was definitely a close contender to them. The bass is rich and the vibration feedback (which my Sony's do not have) is an absolute joy when gaming and watching action flicks. The sounds are distinct and I noticed a very faint muddiness to them since I am an audiophile but for the masses, the sound is excellent. My main gripe however with the sound is that the high's can get a little bit too sharp where it kind of hurts my ears. But then again I want to emphasize that for the price, you are going to be getting $100 sounding headphones and by that it is a definite buy.______________MICROPHONE: I had high hopes for the microphone quality so when I tested them out I was a little disappointed. Overall sound quality of my voice over was excellent. My voice sounded clear with no noise or static in the background however the sound was very quiet. I had to speak rather loudly to the microphone and crank it up to 75% to actually hear myself. I know for most people they can change the equalizer but it is just another hassle I would have liked to avoid. As far as background noise reduction it did a pretty good job. I give the microphone a pass but with a little bit of disappointment._______________CONCLUSION: For the price, you are getting one of the best gaming headsets there is. The build is good and the sound is just superb. I can overlook its shortcomings because this is a truly exceptional headset.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRRDMZH9C0828/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TRHOC0#wasThisHelpful","RRRDMZH9C0828","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"* I received a free unit of this device in exchange for an honest review and I want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way. Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, let's get on with the review.__________DESIGN: The design of these headphones are nice and sporty albeit a bit generic. I like the neck style and the green pop of color and apart from that its a decent looking pair of buds. I really like the soft touch feel to the wires and the flat design keeps it from being tangled.__________CONNECTIVITY: Bluetooth pairing on these guys is a breeze and only took me a minute tops. The connection is just good enough to allow you to walk around a medium sized room without having a dropped connection similar to other headphones out there in the market. Taking calls and replying also gave excellent feedback so I recommend these if you need a quick car bluetooth set.____________SOUND QUALITY: This is where it all comes crashing down. Unfortunately for me the sound did not deliver at all. I listened to an array of music genres while testing it out and I found myself cringing every time I would put on a song. The bass is punchy and the mids are great but what's the problem? The high's are incredibly screechy and it became a pain to the ears. I could not at all listen to electronic music and had to skip the song and go to the next one but as soon as a high note was hit, I started to cringe again. Listening to highs is like listening to a banshee scream in your ears. It is downright painful to keep these on. Unfortunately, that is why I had to take 2 stars off. A lot of people will buy these headphones to get good sound, but I truly think that there are other headphones in this price range that offer far better quality than these._______________CONCLUSION: Unfortunately I did have to give my honest opinion and give this product 3 stars. If they toned down the high notes, this could have easily gotten 4 or 5 stars. I want customers to get headsets that are enjoyable when they listen to music and I did not get joy out of these. As an audiophile who loves to listen to good earbuds, these buds unfortunately are not at the top of my list.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VIT4X7JX9RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015F1HK60#wasThisHelpful","R17VIT4X7JX9RF","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After three weeks she has stated that this made eating bulkier meals a lot more tolerable for her. It definitely is not a cure but she said that she would recommend these for people who are having a hard time digesting food like her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8AXD1OTXF0D6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RH5K26I#wasThisHelpful","R8AXD1OTXF0D6","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"* I received a free unit of this product in exchange for an honest review and I want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way.This charger is great if you are the person who tend to love being near the sun or any type of outdoors environment. The solar power will have it charged and ready to go but sometimes I admit is a little gimmicky for not everyone will use this feature due to the limitations of needing to be outside or under direct sunlight. However, they do include an usb port so that you can charge the device quickly if you would rather charge it the old fashion way. The charger is definitely rugged and built to last the extremities of the outdoors. This is the perfect charger for the adventure man/ woman. The included flashlight is bright and works great. I haven't had any issues with the flash light.The main gripe that I do have about this charger is the battery indicator light. It is always flashing and I couldn't find a way to turn it off. It was even on when I took it out of the box once I had gotten it from my mailbox. After a while this can get a bit annoying and I wish there was an option to turn off the indicator when you do not need to see it. Overall this is a great buy for the hikers/ campers out there if you can handle the indicator lights always flashing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26LPJAER8MNN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IC1GJC#wasThisHelpful","R26LPJAER8MNN0","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot of people like to compare this scent to Thierry Mugler's Amen but to be honest I have not yet tried out Amen. On initial spray however, it reminded me a lot of CK Obsession for men but more casual than Obsession offers. It is also a lot lighter than CK Obsession. Projection is average and I wish it could project slightly more than it does. Longevity on the other hand is a beast. It lasts up to a full work day on me and I am really impressed with that since this is such a cheap scent. The one gripe that I do have is the packaging. The unit itself is made poorly and the glass work looks like it was made from a low cost run down factory. The packaging and glass bottle quality is atrocious but all in all the scent is excellent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33FRB0JWZLUFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003X6DAJ6#wasThisHelpful","R33FRB0JWZLUFI","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"* I received a free unit of these headphones for review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way.These headphones are the best sounding ones you can get at this price range. Under 10 dollar headphones tend to be muddy and outright horrendous in terms of sound quality and they break in a matter of days. Luckily, these headphones seem to give rather good sound. Yes there is some muddiness and the highs can get a little shreaky from time to time but for the price they sound superb. You can't expect stellar sound out of these but they are definitely satisfactory for the casual commute.Unfortunately, these headphones so lac in build quality. The volume buttons although clicky had the volume up button being more squishy than the volume down button. With further inspection, I saw that the UP button was not installed well. The wires are thin and can break easily if not taken care of. All in all, a satisfactory device for the price but don't expect any wonders here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BSQQ4CD9MILZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154ARF94#wasThisHelpful","R1BSQQ4CD9MILZ","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"* I received this car mount for free in exchange for an honest review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way shape or formThis is a cheap but effective phone mount if you are looking for an affordable phone mount. For the price that you will pay for it, you will get what you pay for. The mount is extremely versatile and holds well. It does all the necessary requirements for a mount and practically holds most phones in the 4- 5.5 inch range. It sticks well to the surfaces that it is applied to. But then you also have to deal with its caveats. The unit is made out of a hard yet cheap form of plastic. The foam padding in my unit, was somewhat peeling when I took mine out of the box. And finally when I stretched it out to place my phone in, the spring made a very creaky sound coming out of it indicating that the most you will get out of this mount could be upwards up to one year or less. All in all you kind of have to sacrifice quality for the price. If that is not an issue for you, go ahead and check this out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H9QT9ORGGQFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126SWVPA#wasThisHelpful","R3H9QT9ORGGQFG","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had been using Nike Free runs for over 2 years and it was high time that i got a new pair of running shoes. I was ready to buy a new pair of free's until I stumbled upon these shows on amazon and fell in love. I have slightly small feet so I am down to buying kids sizes since they cost much less than adult sizes. So I decided to give the new boost foam shoes a try and this is my review:_________DESIGN: What can I say about these shoes. They are definitely a looker. The brilliant electric blue color along with the the well accented black and white really do catch your eyes and the eyes of others as well. I have no complaints about the design. I love the blue and they will be the envy of other runners in the track.__________COMFORT: These are a bit heavier and more restricted in movement than my Free Runs but the flexible upper helps in increasing flexibility even though its not a minimalist shoe. This shoe is more of a hybrid between a minimalist and stability shoe. The ankle area is a but tight for me but I am easily adjusting to them. My biggest complaint as far as comfort goes is that they do end up getting hot in the long runs. Please be aware of this.___________CUSHIONING and PERFORMANCE: The boost foam is remarkably pleasant. It really does feel like memory foam for your feet but as far as making my runs more effective, I found no difference between these and my Free Runs which means the performance is great and definitely worth the price that they are being sold for. And the cushioning of course is phenomenal.____________CONCLUSION: I love these shoes and recommend these if you are considering them. Give them a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22IM916HRMCT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RMDNKQ#wasThisHelpful","R22IM916HRMCT5","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had previously tried the Acqua di Gio Cologne by this company from the local walmart and I have to say that impression had great sillage, projection and longevity not to mention it really did indeed smell like Acqua di Gio. However, Abercrombie's Fierce is one of my favorite fragrances of all time so I really wanted to try this out. Needless to say this satisfied my expectations. The fragrance has good sillage, great projection, and 5+ hour longevity. The only downside is that I wish that they offered a 6.7 oz bottle! It is a very good investment of 10 dollars rather than paying about a 100 for the original Fierce.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR5BA5DWP5QGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTS08GC#wasThisHelpful","RR5BA5DWP5QGC","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I sampled this item from the neighborhood department store expcting much out of this since curve fragrances tend to smell great but still be affordable. However, I was extremely disappointed by this scent. The top notes are a more alcoholic version of abercrombie's fierce but then it quickly dissipates into the mid and base notes which are very soapy. Soapy to the point it reminded me of laundry detergent. I don't know about you but I really would not like to smell like that. Projection was less than average and longevity is actually pretty good. The only thing this scent has going for it unfortunately is longevity. Apart from that it's a pass.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GPSCDM67F35V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5RY9OM#wasThisHelpful","R1GPSCDM67F35V","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The top notes of this fragrance is very putrid in my opinion. It seemed like a concoction of every manly scent out there but not in a good way. However, I found the dry down to be quite pleasant although a bit too soapy for my tastes. Longevity is great for the price you are paying for it and projection is moderate.

"* I received a free unit for review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any wayI thought I already had tested enough headphones in this price range to know what under 50 dollar bluetooth headphones can offer, but I was wrong. As a user of high end audio products, this unit surprised me for being the best under 50 dollar bluetooth headsets to date. Before this, the Soundpeats QY7 held the throne but these headphones easily dethroned the QY7's and here is why:_________________DESIGN: Design of these headphones is sleek and versatile. They fit almost all workout environments and the structure of the headphones do well to wrap snugly around your head to prevent them from falling off during your intense runs. I do have to point out that outside of the workout environment, they do look quite dorky especially for the younger generation so please be aware of that. I wore them around my friends once at the university and lets just say their comments have made me decide to only use them in my workouts._________________BUILD QUALITY: These headphones were made for the athlete in mind. They can take quite a beating, ample amounts of sweat, and lots of rustling around without falling off your years. The tension around your head is just enough to keep them snug and secure for intense movement but not tight enough to make them uncomfortable. I did however found that after an hour of use, my ears did start to hurt a little bit but that could be just my ears adjusting to in ear buds. Also, the ear cushions on these are a joy to interchange. They come off rather easily and provide no hassle when switching them out. Sometimes I get really frustrated with changing ear buds because they are such a hassle to put back on but these were by far the easiest to apply.____________________SOUND QUALITY: Now here is the ultimate make it or break factor of almost all headphones. The sound quality in these are GREAT for the price that you will be paying for them. The buds provide a great neutral sound with no forms of distortion. Bass is a bit punchy and will satisfy the average joe but not people who want really good bass. Mids and highs are satisfactory and overall I think these are quite pleasant to listen to. There are no harsh notes or muffling sounds. I have been listening to these for the last three hours and I could see myself buying these headphones for a friend looking for a well rounded workout accessory._________________BLUETOOTH: Pairing is a breeze and links up in a matter of seconds and range is quite average.  I have had not had any drops during my testing and am very happy with bluetooth responsiveness._________________CONCLUSION: I love these headphones for the price that they are being sold at. Of course they won't replace my choice headsets but still these are quite impressive. They are now the reigning champion of my list of under 50 headsets/buds and I definitely recommend them for the fitness conscious person on a budget. Great sound, Great Durability, and Great Responsiveness.

"* received a free unit of this product in exchange for an honest review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way shape or form. Now on with the the review.DESIGN AND FORM FACTOR: By far this is a versatile unit with a pretty low profile. It plugs in easily to your car and you can discretely hid the wires away. Build quality is great and seems quite durable and the construction of the overall unit seems like it can really take a beating. I am impressed with the quality and it gets top marks all around.EFFECTIVENESS: Installation is very easy. All you need to do is to hook it up to the port in your car and set the FM frequency to an unoccupied station. Tune yore radio to the station and voila. You now can play music from your phone to your car radio. I have not experienced any hiccups or issues during the length of my testing and it is joy to finally be able to listen to spotify with my cars speakers.As a plus, the unit also comes with a USB port to charge your phone so it is a two in one device that is both reliable and effective!

When I was offered to review this item, I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and just try the solution. After a few days of administration, her dog became more motile and even jumped around quite a bit without any sort of limp. This product is by no means a cure to the aging of dogs, but it does make their lives more easy when faced with bone and joint pain. I definitely recommend you trying this solution and seeing if it makes the life of your dog easier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JDM867NJ3HSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H1CLRA2#wasThisHelpful","R2JDM867NJ3HSE","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a free unit of this item for an honest and unbiased review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine an not influenced by others in any way shape or formI am a an active person who loves to workout at the gym and go on multiple mile jogs for pleasure. It is essential that I have some sort of additional protein to keep up with my lifestyle that I have. For years, I have been taking whey protein filled with artificial ingredients and colors in addition to maybe even potentially harmful chemicals. Though I am the type of person to continue to eat the seemingly bad protein ( I have an incredibly low budget since I am a college student), I deeply respect protein powders that are made with the consumer in mind. This protein powder is purely derived from plants and not animals in any way in addition to being USDA certified organic. It gives ample amounts of protein for post workout drinks although a bit less than its overly processed whey counterparts, and its easy on the stomach. I had no problems digesting the product in my week trial that I have been using it. Though the taste could be better, I find that mixing anything with milk makes even an unpleasant taste quite tolerable. I get good amounts of protein into my post workout drink with Hemp protein without the harmful substances so what else can I say? If one has the resources to invest in products that are wholesome and good for you, they should definitely try this as a replacement to regular whey. This might not be able to replace the protein for heavy body builders, but for the average person who likes going to the gym, the amount of protein is enough to meet your needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HL2PDXG7YU1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGW28R8#wasThisHelpful","R1HL2PDXG7YU1B","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This flavor of Koka noodles is one of the best ramen noodles you can get out there and it contains no msg as an added bonus. Coconut is the primary ingredient in this flavor so I have to emphasize that you should make sure that you are coconut tolerant.

"This is a great summer shoe for men and women (with big feet). It is a canvas style shoe with a design unlike others that I have seen on the market so it will definitely help yo stand out from the large amount of people purchasing TOMS inspired canvas shoes these days. The material is comfortable on your feet and fits nicely. I certainly do love the pattern on the canvas and it complements the designs near the stitching and sole. The shoes is well made and comfortable and the sole is definitely built to last. The design of the shoes reminds me of a cross between classic vans and Toms if you want a good visual. I recommend it especially if you are into unique patterns.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YEYVC7AOLKEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VOG4YT2#wasThisHelpful","R2YEYVC7AOLKEO","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great entry level Turf shoes made by Nike. It is lower priced than most Turf shoes out there in the market but that does not mean that it is bad. With the lower price you are going to have to make some slight sacrifices however. The upper is a bit thicker than the the higher end ones of the hypervenom line is probably the most noticeable difference. The shoes are extremely light, with a great textured pattern on the upper. Overall the design is great and does provide pops of color that other can marvel at.

"Wow this game is actually pretty terrible. This is game a a carbon copy cut the rope clone that has a minion as the monster that eats the candy in the game. Absolutely no effort was given into polishing the game because if the person new anything about minions, their favorite food is the banana so I found it odd that you have to feed it a mint candy. Also the game suffers from severe framerate issues and ads popping in left and right. The animations are incredibly choppy with no attention to detail and the minion sprite looks like a terrible drawing of someone who really wanted to make a quick buck making this game.

"* I receieved a free unit for review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by other s in any way. Now let's get on with the review:____________DESIGN: The design is just like any other bluetooth headset of this design. That is not to say that it is a bad thing. It is subtle and can be hidden away with most outfits with a collar or long hair. It makes great for every day situations where subtlety is key and there is no reason to stand out from the crowd._____________DURABILITY: The quality of these headsets is similar to others that I have personally reviewed. That is really good for this price range. It works well and will most likely last up to one year or more depending on how you take care of it. The only problem that I did find was that I found the buttons to be a little more flimsy than I would have liked it to be.____________CONNECTIVITY: Setting up the bluetooth was a breeze and everything was ready to go in a matter of seconds. Range is typical of these bluetooth headsets as well (About 10 meters) and overall was satisfactory compared to other headsets.___________CALLS: Call quality is great. I made a couple of calls as a test and the connection was good. I could clearly hear the receiver and the receiver could clearly hear me. Great service here.____________SOUND: Listening to music for an entry level bluetooth headset is good. It is what you expect from this grade of headsets and it will satisfy most people unless you are uber picky about the sound that you are getting and lets be honest, if you are that picky you need to be looking at the over 100 dollar headsets out there._____________CONCLUSION: I recommend these headsets to anyone looking for their first affordable bluetooth headset or a replacement for their old/broken one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AIGVG1I2CN0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z56JVI6#wasThisHelpful","R2AIGVG1I2CN0S","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a free unit to review for an honest opinion and I want to emphasize that all opinions on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way. Now let's get on with the review:__________DESIGN: The design of these earphones are stellar. They look wonderful and look like they are built to last. It does have the initial notion that they are made to be used by people who are active for that is the design element these headphones tend to exhibit. The whole thing is soft to the touch which is a feature that I truly enjoy and overall the whole thing is a looker and will probably have some heads turning the next time you decide to whip these out in public.__________DURABILITY: Like I have said before, these things ae made to last. Looking at the device I can see that it is mad of quality materials and everything is sturdy yet in a small form factor. Cords are thin but strong and there is not a hint of cheap material on these. I am satisfied wit the overall built quality and these far outperform in terms of quality in comparison to similar priced earphones. The ear cushions are easy to apply depending on the size that you are comfortable with. I did not have any problems swapping out the ear cushions and they fit tremendously well with the size of my earholes ( I always have to switch them out for the smallest size).__________CONNECTION: Bluetooth set up is a breeze to do. I had it running in a matter of seconds but just a warning that the initial pairing voice is intensely loud so if you are noise sensitive, be careful. The box says that it has a 10m radius and I found this to be true with my range testing. It is just enough range to keep your phone in your bag and still be able to give you enough service to transverse a small home room dedicated to being a gym.____________SOUND QUALITY: This is by far the biggest bummer in the product. I found the sound quality to be bland and tinny and definitely far lower in quality compared to similar products in this price range. If you want the best quality sound possible, you might want to skip this out. I know a lot of you will probably not like reading this  but this is a huge deal breaker for people who want the best sound quality for the price. Quite possibly the biggest letdown but it is a significant letdown._____________CONCLUSION: If you are looking for an affordable bluetooth headset that goes along with your personal style and it built to last, then this might be it for you. Just be aware of the sound quality that will leave you wanting more in the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A7YGSZKK2H5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010WO7U8I#wasThisHelpful","R1A7YGSZKK2H5T","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful watch with a bluish purple dial and time marks that are subtle and elegant. Metal band finish that looks smooth and links of course are easily removable and adjusted to the size that you would like it to be.

"Can mission impossible get any better after having 4 former movies behind it? Fortunately for this series, Tom Cruise is the gift that keeps on giving and that is a good thing. The story is over the top and still down to earth in the typical Mission Impossible fashion, the characters are likeable and overall the action scenes are still heart pumping.It seems that with every iteration of a mission impossible movie, it just keeps getting better and better. This movie in particular had a pretty great story that was easy to follow even for those who are new to spy films though there might be some confusion if someone isn't aware of the former mission impossible installments. There is humor to keep things light every now an then and take a step back from the thumping suspense, and of course the action scenes are still pretty amazing.The actors have really good chemistry between themselves and it really feels realistic. Tom Cruise takes his stunts very seriously and it really does well with selling the intensity of those really dangerous stunts that were done. If you are into action movies, this is a great movie to add to your list especially if you have seen the previous films. Rogue Nation takes bits and pieces of what was great in the previous films and fine tunes them to ultimately end with a bang.As a casual fan of action films, I found this movie to be gripping and entertaining. I definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TBU2540IVJO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012XYQ1S0#wasThisHelpful","R1TBU2540IVJO2","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Incredibly detailed and well made leather bracelet for men or women with bigger wrists. Please check the diameter of the bracelet before purchasing because it might not fit everyone. It certainly doesn't fit my small tiny wrists but definitely fits my brothers. It is made really well and the dark blue color is gorgeous.

It is light, portable and built really well in terms of quality. It does not feel like cheap plastic at all and the grip has a soft touch feel to it to make holding in while weighting a lot more comfortable. The display is big and bright and I have not noticed any blemishes on the product in terms of quality. The strap is nicely made and I do see it lasting for quite a number of years. One thing I must add is that it uses a coin battery which some people not to have because they are harder to find out there.As far as accuracy of weighting, I am happy to say that it performs well. I tested out a 3.3 pound onion bag that I had bought from the store and what do you know, the machine counted it as 3.3 lbs.

"* I received a free unit of this device in exchange for an honest review and I want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any wayThis phone mount for your car in unlike any other gps mount that I have encountered because it does not utilize the traditional mechanism for gps mounts which use suction. I was a little skeptical at first, but once the mount was in and ready, I was amazed by the effectiveness of the whole thing. Not only did it work, but it was surprisingly convenient because suction mounts tend to come off in hot weather but this kind of guarantees that it will stick. There are included adapters depending  on the size of your car CD slot and there's plenty of flexibility on the mount to adjust it to an angle that suits you best.The build is really good too. It is well constructed with a soft touch overlay. The plastic is rigid and durable and overall does seem like it can last for a very long time as long as you take good care of it. The holdher extends to fit most phone sizes but I recommend that you take it off a phone case if your are using it because the phone case may be a little too thick for the clamps. Overall the build it really good except one problem that I have with it which is the spring. I can here the spring every time I extend the clamps and it gives the impression that the spring will not last for a while. I have a fear that the spring can snap any moment when I stretch it out because I can literally here the strain it puts on the spring when I stretch it.Overall, this is a unique and effective holde for your phone and I would recommend it to someone who is tired of using the suction mounts out there. My main concern is the durability of the spring so please keep that in mind when purchasing the product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CLAIX4G38H7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VEAF6SG#wasThisHelpful","R1CLAIX4G38H7T","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These sandals in my opinion is not for extensive use but for casual beach ware. It has a thin sole that does offer a bit of cushioning but at the same time not enough for it to be comfortable for hours on end.

"Inside is another stellar movie created by Pixar animation studio and it centers around a young girl named Riley who just moves to a new town and a new school. And then she begins to have a myriad of emotions due to the fact that she feels alone and friendless and begins to lash out in emotional ways. We then see that inside her head there a personified versions of her emotions that are interacting with one another and how these interactions affect her behavior. As far as story goes, I am going to stop here to prevent any spoilers.The story here is very well thought out and can range from heartfelt to deeply emotional. Pixar create a great movie that not only is funny and attractive for kids, but still doesn't stop itself from becoming extremely thought provoking and serious. There is a message here in this movie especially for kids who are going to start going into their preteen years about what it feels like to be growing up and the inner struggles that kids at the time go through. It is cleverly interwoven to a great story and I personally loved it.The animations here are great and wonderful. Colors just pop and the 3D animation schemes are displayed really well in true Pixar fashion. The cast of characters are greatly designed and overall this is just another beautiful piece of animations that you don't see many animators get does but Pixar does.This is yet another Pixar movie that knocks it out of the park and I encourage kids and adults to watch it together for an unforgettable experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11WHPD4BOHJD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZMEBFS#wasThisHelpful","R11WHPD4BOHJD0","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My brother got these just couple days ago since these wing tip shoes are in style these days and I gotta say that these actually look pretty sharp. I really like the suede upper material because it feel nice and comfortable without being too formal and giving lots of shine. The sole has a unique texture in the bottom and it does have a little bit of flex to it for comfort instead of being extremely rigid. The heel isn't that big to begin with but it was just enough of a heel to give a nice look. Overall these heels give a really nice look to the wearer especially with chinos or dark wash skinny jeans. If your a guy looking for some comfortable wing tips, I recommend these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R284B4IJLTXP44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGXS9SA#wasThisHelpful","R284B4IJLTXP44","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a free sample of this unit in exchange for an honest review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any wayWhen I first started taking these I really didn't know how it would affect my body except for the fact that the label says that in increases strength. I decided not to look anything up in order to minimize the placebo effect and continued to take one once a day for two weeks. Within the last couple of days I have noticed that I have been getting far less sore the day after intense workouts than I usually due and I really think it is due to taking these pills. As far as energy I don't think it helped but it has tremendously lessened the amount of soreness post workout and I am doing Insanity at the moment which is famous for making people sore for days at a time. I have also noticed that I am able to do a lot more situps and muscle heavy workouts without feeling muscle fatigue ( though I do have to stop because my heart cant keep up.) This allows me to pump more reps in each workout and I am quite pleased. You can definitely benefit from these supplements if you are tired of feeling that your muscle soreness is keeping you from being at the top of your game in later workouts. I feel like one pill a day does just the trick for me but then again I am more on the petite side. I am quite happy with this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UE4QQOZQSGPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2ENKQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3UE4QQOZQSGPF","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way shape or formGarcinia is one of those new ""revolutionary"" weight loss supplements that have been on the market for a while made famous by endorsing celebrities, so when this product came to my door I was rather skeptical of the product. I had consulted a dietitian who is a a lab partner of mine at my university and she informed me to take the product and hype with a grain of salt because it might not work for everyone. So for every meal for the last two weeks I have been using this product to see whether it will work for me.I am a 5'1"" person weighing just under 100 punds and to be honest I am at the top of my physical game at the moment. So when I saw that I hadn't lost much weight after taking these, I wasn't very surprised because to be honest, how much can I lose being the weight that I am now. However, I am very happy to say that this supplement really has helped me in my workouts. I have been taking them with a meal before my regular insanity routine and these guys do a great job of keeping my energy levels up. I have a much smoother workout session using these pills and I am really satisfied with the performance I get on my workouts after taking these in. Just for that I am giving these pills 4 stars because if an overweight person took advantage of the workout enhancing effects of these pills, then they would surely lose weight.The only drawback I have with these pills, is that they are incredibly expensive if you are taking them before every meal. Definitely consider how much you have in your wallet before investing in these because they go pretty quickly. Overall, these supplements are a great addition to your workout routine but definitely not replacement. Give these guys a try if you have the spare cash to keep a steady monthly supply.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCQDT6ZA6331/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXA2URY#wasThisHelpful","R3CCQDT6ZA6331","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received a free unit for review by Etekcity and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any way shape or form. Now on with the review______________DESIGN: The design of this unit is sleek and metallic and does well to fit into any office type environment with an addition of a touch of professionalization in mind. I really like the look of it and it really does give off a premium look to it._______________DURABILITY: The sharpener here has a good bit of heft to it but not to the point where it is overly heavy. It is light enough to be easily carried around, but sturdy enough to feel like it is made of good durable material. There are rubber grips on the bottom that keeps the unit from sliding about everywhere especially in slippery wooden tables and that is a major plus. My only concern in terms of build quality is the fact that the plastic housing that keeps all the pencil shavings can be a little flimsy. For that price that you will be paying for this sharpener, I kind of expected it to be a little bit better in rigidity than it is. Other than that one flaw, the unit is definitely durable._______________INSTALLATION: Etekcity includes a manual with this device but technically there is not need for it. You just plug in in and it works like a charm without any other necessities._______________EFFECTIVENESS: When you put the pencil into this machine you kind of have to actually push in more than the average electronic pencil sharpener. The pencil goes pretty deep into the device but after you take it out, what do you know you have a perfectly sharpened pen. I really like the strength of the blades because it got me a sharpened pen every time that I stuck them in and pulled them out. I recommend only using this machine for pencils however and not crayons and colored pencils because it may break your machine or make it less efficient than it originally was. You can tell this one is only designed for pencil use.As far as the sound, I found it to be a lot quieter than the average automatic sharpener. It isn't too loud and a lot easier on the ears. Another plus to the already great product. It isn't completely silent though. It is loud but it is a lot easier on the ears than many other ones out there._____________CONCLUSION: If you are looking for a heavy duty pencil sharpener, I definitely recommend this guy. As a college student, I need pencils for test taking so it is nice to quickly push a pencil in before test day and have a well sharpened pencil ready.

"This game has cool animations and overall good atmosphere when it comes to games but the main place where it lacks at is probably its biggest fault. The gameplay here is very tedious and lacks any sense of depth. You just drag your finger across the screen while these animations happen but most of the time you are just guiding your finger in the surgery without actually doing anything important. So much potential but ultimately a disappointment.

"So I have never watched Clarence before but I saw that this game app was very similar to this game I played about ten years ago that had the same premise but with Lilo and Stitch and it was very popular with my friends back then. This game is essentially a rebirth of that game but Clarence edition and I couldn't be any happier. The premise of the game is to stack as many desired ingredients as possible to make the largest burger without grabbing any of the unwanted ingredients such as the bombs. Every time you progress it gets harder and harder to stack them up and that is the most addicting part of it. It is a very fun game and I am glad that cartoon network has made a newer version of it for newer generations.

"* I received a free unit of this product in exchange for an honest review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by others in any wayThis phone mount holder is a great accessory to anyone who likes to use their phones as a means of a gps instead of buying a standalone gps. The whole unit is made of a hard and sturdy plastic that seem like it will definitely last a while. There are knobs that allow your to adjust the position of how your phone will look once it is mounted so there is great room for flexibility here. The latches that hold the phone can extend to accommodate an array of phone sizes. I personally used a Motorola Droid Turbo with a protective case around it and the phone fit perfectly with the latches. I do recommend the use of a rubber band to safely secure the phone onto the mount however for extra protection in case there are any heavy jerks during driving.The Suction works really well and lasts even in hot 80 degree summer days. There are times that it will come off due to temperature but I found that using alcohol to wipe down the area and the suction helps in retaining the strength of the suction cup. Overall this is a great phone mount for anyone looking for a holder for their gps needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DKMVJ6N2TMTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YG8MLOA#wasThisHelpful","R2DKMVJ6N2TMTI","A3BNYTSB9XBCUN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNYTSB9XBCUN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This canvas shoes is of the higher premium canvas shoes out there compared to the much cheaper vans or Keds but there is some differences to these shoes that ""Kind of"" justify the premium price. The whole shoe is covered in a textile fabric lined with genuine leather accents. The textile here is a lot thicker than the average canvas shoes that you can get for 40 bucks.There is a gold trimmed leather line that appear on the front and back of the shoe to add a little pop to the overall look of the shoe. The sole is a bit larger than the average but provides lots of shock absorbency and it is quite comfortable to wear all day. The heel has the iconic Ted Baker T with the rubber bottom of the sole decorated with T's as well. Overall is a really well built canvas shoes with an adorable flower print.

"~*Contents*~-48 Piece Water Color Colored Pencil Set w/ Accessories~*Pros*~-48 soft lead colored pencils-Great Color Range Variety-Quality Roll Up Carrying Case-Bonus Pencil Sharpener, Eraser, and Paint BrushI enjoy drawing in my spare time, and have always had a love for art work.  I have been in need of a new set of colored pencils, but I did not want to spend an insane amount of money, as I did on my last set.  I came across this set of artist grade soft lead pencils, and decided to give it a try to see if I would like them.I received this 48 piece set and quickly placed all the pencils and accessories in the roll up case. I did like how all the pieces did come separate so that I could set it up in the color scheme of my choice.  The Canvas holder is made of excellent quality, and rolls up to two different sizes of my choosing. There is a snap button on the strap that secures the case, and keeps the pencils nice and neat inside.  There are also spots pre made for the sharpener, eraser, and thin paint brush.The color variety is pretty good. You get a wide range of colors and each color scheme has about 4-6 pencils.  The widest scheme is the pink-red shades.  The pencils draw very well, and little pressure is needed for vibrate color. Soft Lead is very important to artists, because it allows us to shade and blend properly, and this set is up to par with some of the more popular brands.The pencil sharpener is made of plastic, and I prefer metal sharpeners, but this one does work fine.  The eraser works excellent and is dust free. I have used it several times so far and its perfect for altering mistakes.Overall I am very pleased with this set of colored pencils, and have been enjoying using them in my spare time. They would make the perfect gift for any seasoned artist, or even a beginner.  I recommend this set to anyone who loves to draw with great soft lead pencils, yet stay within a reasonable budget.**I received this set of colored pencils discounted during a promotional period for an unbiased review.

I had a very close friend who was from Korea, and I would stay over her house often.  Her parents made some of the most delicious meals I have ever eaten as a child, and it was how I first learned to use chopsticks.This cookbook is right up my alley when it comes to pleasing my palette. The book is broken up into two parts, and I love how its starts off with an introduction to Korean Culture. It shares some excellent information on holidays, etiquette, and cooking essentials, and then proceeds into the second section which is the recipes.The recipes in this book are of great variety. From cooking appetizers, to marinades, to soups, it really gives you a good variety depending on your preferences when it come to Korean cuisine.One of my favorite recipes so far is the BBQ braised short ribs. Korean BBQ is definitely one of my preferred dishes, and I just can't get enough.  There is also a special section near the back of the book that goes into ""bar food"" appetizers, that are unique and different , and would be perfect to serve during a dinner guest event.Overall I am really enjoying the recipes and all the information I learned from this cookbook.

I have always heard such good things about them, and have been looking for the perfect one to suit me. Well let me tell you I have found it!This Rice Cooker not only cooks and produces eight cups of rice to perfection, but also has the capabilities to steam veggies, cook fish, and make large meals all in this petite cooker.  This cooker measures 8.5 x 9.3 x 8.7 inches, weighs a little over four lbs, and is completely digital. It plugs right into a regular electrical outlet.This cooker opens left to right with a push button. There is  a steam basket inside that sits on top of a removable aluminum teflon coated insert, that is spring loaded. You make your rice in the aluminum pot, and use the steamer basket for veggies and can even cook a meat of your choice in this same area.The control panel area is digital and at a press of a button you can select the right setting for what you are cooking. Whether is white or brown rice, and even steam. It preset to a timer, but if you open it up and feel you need more time, there is a button to extend the timer. You can also press the ""keep warm"" button if your meal is completed but you aren't quite ready to eat.I have made both white and wild rice so far, as well as a piece of cod that I steamed, and it has worked excellent.

" 4:40 Mins ~*Contents*~-(1) Wireless Receiver-(1) Wireless Transmitter-(2) Meat Probes-mounting accessories*Pros*-Convenient-Simple to Use-Accurate-VersatileThis is by far the most unique meat thermometer device I have used to date. There is a receiver and a transmitter that allows you to keep a probe in meat to monitor the temp down in my garage, while being able to monitor the temp from inside my kitchen. Its very simple to use and has about a 300 ft range.  There are two probes provided in case you are like our family and cook different meats at the same time. We can plug one into the chicken and one into the beef and see both temps on the receiver at all time.There are about 6 common presets for chicken, beef, pork etc, and then there are 9 bonus presets for more ""game"" type meat such as deer and elk. You can also set your prepared color rare, medium, well and well done.Each device takes 2 AAA batteries, and I prefer rechargeable.  There is also grill mounting brackets included so that you can set the probes up perfectly without fear of damaging the transmitter.  Each station has several ways to secure itself, whether it is hanging or a stand.There is a sync button located on the back of the transmitter, so that if you find you have lost a connection, you are able to re sync the receiver and transmitter. Also if for any reason the transmitter gets too far out of range, the receiver will begin to beep alerting you that there is a signal problem. I do have to re sync often, but once it connects, it works great.Its so convenient having one of these, because I can prep the rest of my dinner in the kitchen, and still know if the meat needs flipped or is nearing done.Overall Its a great system that is easy to use and so convenient to own. I recommend this temp system to anyone who struggles with running back and forth to the grill while juggling kids at the same time!**I received this thermometer set free during a promotional period for an unbiased review.

"This lead is fantastic because the material around the hand/wrist is soft and malleable to whatever way it is most secure and comfortable for the human to hold. The material isn't just one width all the way around the handle, it's tapered in various spots to make it the most ergonomically comfortable to hold in certain places.

"I was a little disappointed with the size of the casserole pan. It holds about 11 cups of water when filled to the brim, but given the need for some space at the top when actually cooking simmering things, it is more of a two quart pot if you're going to avoid spillovers. For a two quart pan, it's not much different in shape, size, or capacity to the largest sauce pan. I would have liked the casserole pan to have been at least half a quart larger. Since the size is so similar to the larger sauce pan, I tend to just use the sauce pan instead of the casserole pan when cooking since it's easier for me to clean the sauce pan with the one handle instead of two on the casserole pan. I feel the 7.9-in casserole is a bit of dead weight in this set of pans.The pans heat up fast and I love the nonstick coating. I don't even need to grab a spatula to help get out things like oatmeal. It just pours right out from tipping the pan contents out. It's just a little thing, but one less step I have to go through in preparing a meal is appreciated. I've had no problems washing these in the dishwasher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTHDIPOU8IX5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RLCOW8#wasThisHelpful","RTHDIPOU8IX5U","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The product packaging indicates the width to be 5-3/8"". The width of the main writable part of the paper of the planner is 5-3/8"", but because of the tabs on the paper and the width of the cover, the actual width of this planner is about 5-7/8"". This makes a big difference to me as it's just enough extra width to make it uncomfortable for me to flip open this book with one hand easily. To have to maneuver opening and closing with both hands makes it a bit more tedious than I would have been able to manage if the width of the full planner was in fact 5-3/8"". My cover split on first opening it into two pieces of paper - metallic pretty paper over cardboard stock. The cover is also too thick to make this an easy flip-through type planner.

"I'm having a lot of fun playing with this set with my dogs at low speed. I think if you tried to get them moving at the speeds you need for contests and such, this set would start falling apart since the connections are not that tight and the force of the dog would dislodge things too often, but for a beginner working at beginner speeds, this set works. I actually like the fact the pieces come apart easily so it's easy to pack up when you're done at the end of the day. None of the pieces connect or disconnect in a confusing way. Everything is straightforward so it's quick to pack up when you're done. Nothing packs up in a bulky way either. It's easy to pack up everything in an organized fashion so it fits in the container bag. I took a few measurements: jumping hoop ~16"" diameter, tunnel ~24"" diameter & ~27"" long. I have dogs of different sizes. One dog is too big for the jumping hoop, but the set still provides two other tasks he can perform.

"I like that the bag material is not bulky. The bag material feels slim and lightweight, but it's still very sturdy. The bulk of the bag is only from its contents. I filled it to near capacity with a load of copy paper from office work, and the bag held up to the weight just fine. Since the bag material is rather slim, I can even fold down this bag when not in use. Though it can be folded and hold heavy loads of paper like my old tote bags, it's clearly more attractive.

"Living in the Western United States, I always had a curiosity of Old West history, but never got taught much of the history specific to the West in the standardized classroom. For example, my history books skipped over entirely the happenings during the Civil War in the West - we only ever learned really of happenings of the North/South along the East Coast. In this book, I happily read more description of the Civil War in the West than I had ever been able to find in all my assigned classroom history books combined from middle school through university. I also loved that this book seems to pull together all of the photos relevant to the Old West that you've ever heard about but never seen. Some pictures in my classroom history books would only be talked about in words, but the National Geographic book actually shows the pictures that history books never seem to have the space for. The mountain of slaughtered buffalo skulls is way larger than I had ever imagined having only heard of it before this book. If you've ever been frustrated by academic history books' ways of skimming details about the Old West, this book will finally satiate that desire to learn quite a bit more about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L7V2JIZ30MFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142621555X#wasThisHelpful","R3L7V2JIZ30MFI","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of this brand, I've tried the Wolf King and Holistique Blendz varieties. The Wolf King kibble is larger and round. The Holistique Blendz kibble is flat and square. I like the Holistique Blendz kibble for my household since I have multiple dogs - one being very small - and the kibble works for all sizes of my dogs. Luckily, my dogs seemed to like the flavor of the Holistique Blendz better than Wolf King anyhow. I have in the past, selfishly, stayed away from fish flavored kibbles to avoid the humans having to deal with the smell of it, but I don't mind the smell of this fish blend. It's not as pungent as other brands I've bought in the past and I hardly smell anything when I open the bag up for feeding time. I'm glad I can get back to giving my dogs a flavor they clearly seem to enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EYLJ8R6A8D9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9DRRYK#wasThisHelpful","R2EYLJ8R6A8D9","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cups hold up well to being used over a long time squeezing them, making the plastic bend inwards, etc. The plastic of these Hefty cups never cracks or feels brittle like cheaper plastic cups. The one issue with these cups is the logo coloring on the outside of the cup rubs off fairly easily once there is some condensation covering it.

"The seat is a lot larger than folding chairs I had purchased many years ago. These measure roughly 15"" deep and 16"" wide. There is no part of my behind hanging off the edges since everything fits on the main surface. The seat is big enough that even when I wish to slouch on the chair, which pushes your rear more forward in the seat, there is still solid surface underneath to support.There is a slight dip in the plastic toward the backside of the seat so it feels somewhat like molded seating. Due to the dip, your rear will tend to slide to the back of the seat whether you want it to or not. It's comfortable to sit in, but I do prefer a more flat surface that makes it easier to sit on the edge of the seat without sliding back. Because you're somewhat made to sit in the back of the seat, it can be slightly difficult for shorter people and children to keep their feet on the ground if that is what they want.There was no wobble to the legs when sitting. Everything felt secure and stable. The leg ends had good grip on my hardwood floors. They didn't scoot around unintentionally when people got on and off the chairs. The legs are nicely unobtrusive. The front legs are well behind where the front of the seat is so when moving the chairs around, the legs do not tend to be a hindrance bumping into other furniture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EY5E1W7RAR88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQWXYW4#wasThisHelpful","R2EY5E1W7RAR88","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hamster pellet food is twice the size of this dog kibble! It's like grape nuts cereal. I do hear a crunching when my chi-mix eats this food, so he is managing to find something to crunch down on. When I put this kibble next to regular small-dog kibble, however, he always goes for a the bigger kibble where he has something to bite on more easily. My big dogs seem intrigued everytime I pour this down on my small dog's plate. They always crowd around wanting a taste. I use it like a sprinkle topping for my big dogs too to spike their appetite when they seem a little tired of their own food.

"If you wanted to make an equivalent of this canned food in your home kitchen, all you'd have to do is take a little boiled chicken and rice and thicken up the stock for some gravy. There are no vegetables. My dogs usually inhale any kind of wet dog food, and they had to be prodded to finish this up by the second day. The meat pieces did not look like natural pieces of chicken. They were rectangles cut from a large pan of remolded chicken/liver mash so the texture did not appeal to my dogs. The texture and shape of the straight-sided rectangles also made the meat pieces stick more to the sides of their food bowl so it was not as easy for them to get it out.Overall, my dogs looked a bit miserable eating this diet food.

"I like that there are ridges along the ball surface so even my small dog can grab the ball by the ridges and carry it around. The plastic used for this ball is heavier than the Hartz DuraPlay balls, which my dogs love, so it's a little more hurtful for my dogs to get smacked in the face when they miss catching it (sadly, quite often). The plastic is thick and durable so even my Golden can't seem to destroy it, but harder to compress to make the squeaker sound. The squeaking sound is half the fun for my dogs. The Nerf football-shaped dog toy squeaks a bit better since the shape is oblong instead of perfectly round, so the structure tends to give way with less force.

I was going out every week to weed where it seemed as if full grown weeds popped up every time in the same spot I cleared just before. I finally decided to try spreading some Preen around, and noticed the areas were not sprouting new weeds. The product works as advertised for me. I've finally been able to take a break from weeding every week. The Preen is great in that it doesn't have some weird color to it, so it doesn't stand out at all in the soil.

"I have a recipe I make often where meat marinates in a rather sugary sauce. Whatever method I use to cook it up, the sugary marinade left on the meat always burns onto the cooking surface and is usually a bit tough to clean up. When I cooked it up on the highest heat on this George Foreman grill, the marinade that cooked off the meat looked burnt on the cooking plates and impossible to get off, but once I scrubbed lightly with some warm water and soap, all the mess came right off. I've never been able to clean up the mess for this recipe that easily before using other cooking methods. It even comes off when I leave the plates for a couple of days before cleaning with the same ease as if I had cleaned it right away when the plates were warm. Between the easier clean-up after cooking and the splatter it contains during cooking, this machine saves me so much time from cleaning in the kitchen.I like this no-handle design better than my older George Foreman grill with handles. The plates come off and on so much easier. You only have to press one button to remove the top or bottom plate and it unclasps both sides for you at once instead of having to deal with unclasping the handles on both sides. I would sometimes struggle with the old design because I would fumble for nearly a whole minute trying to get the plates to line up correctly to where the handle clasps would catch and keep the plates on the grill. These plates line up better, faster, and click into place easier. It also saves on counter/storage space to have the handles gone. The space used up by the machine is nearly all for the cooking surface, not awkward handle space.Having this George Foreman lets me eat the foods I love a lot more often. Before, I would take into consideration how hard it would be to scrub down the kitchen and cooking surfaces, but now I don't think of it as much of an obstacle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LG1N2D5NVN59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUWVE#wasThisHelpful","R2LG1N2D5NVN59","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This seems to make it more fun to play for a longer period of time for my dog.

"I love the original Burt's Bees balm formula so much that I'm always eager to try the new flavors hoping there'll be something as good, but there really isn't anything better than the original peppermint. The original balm strikes a good balance between firm wax and softer oils used so it doesn't feel too slick or soft going on, but still feels very nourishing to the skin. Of course the cherry on top being the perfect dose of peppermint oil that gives a nice smell and tingle to the lips.I like the fruit flavors less. The fruit balms are definitely more oily, but they still feel nourishing to the skin, and don't make my lips break out, which happens with some oily-feeling balms, particularly those with petrolatum in it. All the Burt's Bees balms seem to provide protection for a long time. At most, I only have to reapply once for the entire day.My least favorite flavor in the Tropical pack was mango.

"One of my dogs can be difficult to entice with packaged treats. He generally reacts only to treats of fresh meat, but really came around when I opened this pack of raw boost mixers. It's sufficiently meaty and tasty to have him jumping at my hand for a taste when I have the bag out.The kibble-sized pieces fall apart into a sawdust consistency if squeezed a bit, so it's not the best treat to travel with in case it gets squished, but being able to turn this into a powder does work well for mix-in purposes to get my dogs to eat some less than desirable kibble. If I leave the treats whole, my dogs tend to pick out the raw boost mixer pieces only and still leave the less tasty kibble in the bowl. Since I can turn these into powder and sprinkle it over kibble where it can spread and stick to individual kibble pieces, my dogs are more inclined to eat the kibble the powder is mixed in to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5ONJOVOZYUSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YWPHX9K#wasThisHelpful","R5ONJOVOZYUSL","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The headphone frame is all one piece and there is no adjustability to the band or earbud length from the main headband. This makes it difficult to keep the earbuds/headphones placed firmly on the sweet spot that gives me the best hearing. They always tend to slide down after moving my head around a bit. Since the headphone stays put based on pressure against your head, where you place the earbuds really does matter since it is on that spot that all the pressure is placed. If you're forced to deal with the pressure in a spot that is not ideal, these headphones can be more of a pain to wear than they would if they could stay where you placed them.I liked the open-ear feature to these headphones, but the volume is seriously compromised. I never felt as if I got anywhere over 50% the volume level I would have gotten with regular headphones, so these headphones are really only good for casual listening or when you're in a space that's quiet around you to begin with.

"This speaker provided a nice sound amplification to my videos and music over what I can usually hear with my ordinary laptop speakers. I really liked that an aux cord is provided to go into a headphone jack so you can still quickly set up the speaker if your Bluetooth is acting up on your device. I wish the provided cord was longer than 14"", however, since the short cord really limits the positioning of the speaker when attached to something like a computer instead of a phone. I also really appreciated the feature that the speaker/sound turns off completely upon closing the cover over the speaker. If there's a reason you need to quiet down things really fast, there's no fumbling around for buttons, simply snap the cover shut.The one negative for me is there are no simple volume control buttons on the speaker.

"This review is for the orange grater with an extra coarse and ribbon grating side.So many times I cook a dish where I need to mince just one clove of garlic and I hate pulling out the cutting board and knife just for the one task (and having to clean it afterward). It is so much easier reaching for the extra coarse grater and quickly making a rough mince with the grater instead. The extra coarse grating hole on the Joseph Joseph is about 1/4"" x 1/8"". I actually prefer using this Joseph Joseph over smaller grater holes for garlic since I've realized the larger bits of garlic I get with the Joseph Joseph don't really impact my dish negatively anyhow, and I can get through grating faster. The extra coarse grater is also a good size to produce things like shredded carrots. The grating width is just enough to handle the fat end of a carrot, a little over 1-1/4"".I like the reversible cover to catch what you grate, but with some fine particles, such as when I grate chocolate and wind up with some dust-like bits, when I stand the grater on end to move everything to the end so I can read the measurement of how much has been collected, the finer bits sometimes escape the cover and make a mess on the working surface. The grater is easy to clean with no hard to reach crevices on the underside.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QOJP3E6O4IN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R86D4PM#wasThisHelpful","R2QOJP3E6O4IN7","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like that panning & tilting on this camera actually means the camera face moves around in different directions to get a better view instead of just zooming in on different areas of the same flat picture as some security cameras I've had in the past have touted as their panning ability. There are tradeoffs for that, however, and as a result, this camera is a bit more clunky than some cameras and harder to tuck away into a discrete spot. The camera is not detachable from the circular base, which moves it around, and requires about 3.5"" diameter space on a flat shelf. You can also mount the device to a wall by hanging it over a nail head. From the wall, it juts out about 4"".The camera is not the best choice if you desire hidden cameras, but it is easy to use and keep maintained since the system is compacted into one device instead of having to deal with an extra base station and cords for other parts of the system.

"I was pleasantly surprised to find the ""puppy formula"" food was shaped like Cheerios instead of a flat hard disc food pellet. I think the Cheerio shape of the kibble with the hole in the middle of the food disc makes it easier for the food to be broken apart by little mouths. My little puppy visibly/audibly struggles a tiny bit less eating this Cheerio kibble instead of regular puppy kibble that's just solid the whole piece through. I appreciate that little bit of extra thought that went into the design of the food. I don't have to worry about him being turned off from hard kibble due to the fact of it being a struggle to bite down on harder bigger pieces.

"I love the internal tension spring these wipers have. It doesn't press too hard against the windshield that you hear the wiper drag or squeak, but it gets a good amount of pressure against the windshield so there are no streaks and everything is wiped very evenly. I installed two new wipers on the front windshield at the same time that were comparable in price - this Bosch on the driver side and a different brand on passenger side. The other wiper did not have the same degree of internal tension spring as these wipers do, and I did notice the difference in the quality of clearing the windshield, even brand new. I am almost looking forward to the day the wipers on all the other family cars become hopelessly in need of replacement so I can replace them all with these wipers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ECZZ5YV21V7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWNZ1LG#wasThisHelpful","R1ECZZ5YV21V7G","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are large, very hard, thick cookies for dogs. They're so hard and thick, it is extremely difficult to spontaneously break one of these up by hand on the spot to share among smaller dogs. I definitely need a tool of some sort to help break these up. Despite that difficulty breaking them up, I am very happy these are so thick and crunchy to give my dogs something to really chew on. They line up whenever they see me pull this bag of treats out and so far have had no complaints.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BGJ2GH81TPJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QRHSTK#wasThisHelpful","R2BGJ2GH81TPJ6","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found the taste very mild. Put another way, somewhat bland. This sauce isn't much worth eating on top of chips or pasta on its own. Your eating experience will be improved dramatically if you consider this sauce a mere base for the sauce you really want to eat and tweak it with your own additions. One way I use up my cheese sauce is take about 2-3 cups of it mixed with a can of Rotel tomatoes and use that for nachos, etc. The sauce mixes with other items seamlessly, no separation. It never hardens into an unmanageable lump, it has always stayed fluid.I kept the cheese in the can in the refrigerator instead of removing it to another container. I did like the fact the can seemed to have a bit of interior coating to keep the metal from oxidizing and affecting the taste/quality of the food product. The product lasted about a month before it went bad.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13QCWN3QPNL8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CFOE2U#wasThisHelpful","R13QCWN3QPNL8B","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This meat log was a lot harder than I expected. It's like a hard cheese. I cut mine into 1/4-1/2"" cubes just fine with a serrated knife. There was some minor dust coming off the ends of the cuts, but the product kept its form for the most part. It is a bit of a hassle to cut by hand, but it really doesn't work any other way. I thought I might see how it would do getting pulsed in a food processor to try to get it to a size something like a small chop or ground meat. The meat roll is too hard for the food processor to chop up so by the time it manages to break up the large bits, the smaller bits that have been shaved off previously by the blade are a fine powder. I like to make my dogs an oatmeal in the morning (1/3 oats, 1/3 veggies, 1/3 meat) - this is a good meat alternative for me to keep on hand for the times I find myself out of fresh meat to serve. These are stable at room temperature so I don't have to use up precious refrigerator space to keep these and they have a longer expiration date than fresh meat so it's easier to hold onto one or two rolls without wasting money. I am happy as long as my dogs seem to like it. So far, they have no hesitation gobbling it up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1952H4KO64MQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JN9GJ7W#wasThisHelpful","R1952H4KO64MQB","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lotion actually absorbs into my skin - it doesn't just smear over my skin and sit on top indefinitely like some lesser lotions. I know this because I can feel the difference when it absorbs vs sitting topically. My ultra-dry skin will tingle with pain when a lotion gets applied but not absorbed. I feel actual relief in my skin when the lotion gets absorbed as with this Eucerin. Besides general moisturizing, it smoothed down some dry scabby skin so it didn't catch on clothes. It absorbs quickly. I feel able to put on clothes and brush against objects without smearing things with lotion just a minute after application. That isn't to say it feels completely clean. There is a very light waxy-coating feeling that takes a little longer to dissipate. A little goes a long way. After using your hands to apply everywhere else, you will definitely feel a greasy build-up on your hands. I liked that with just one simple wash instead of multiple soapy latherings, I was able to get the gunky feeling off my hands.One negative aspect for me was the pump the lotion comes out of. It squirts out a lot at a time. It seems equivalent to some wide-mouth pump hand soap bottles. This is fine if you're applying over a lot of skin, but often I just want a really tiny dab of lotion to cover the back of my hands or some other small spot. Even pushing as lightly as possible to get the littlest amount, I still get too much and have to find other areas to spread the excess lotion. If you want more control over how much lotion comes out, it may be best to stick to the squeeze tubes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V8QW9WT81MRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2MYTYS#wasThisHelpful","R3V8QW9WT81MRN","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This corner shelf is unobtrusive and has a simple, yet practical design. The front edge of the shelf is set back far enough from the grab bar so that even though you might load things up against the very front of the shelf, the shelf items won't obstruct your hand from grabbing the bar when needed. I like how the shelf doesn't use an overly-tight snap fitting to the metal frame and just requires a sort of soft snap to fit in place. It's extremely easy to remove the shelf portion to clean.

"The materials used are all sturdy. There is little doubt these handles will last you a long time.The length of the handles and the carabiners do not suit me particularly well. Sometimes the ends of the carabiners smack me in the elbow when I'm getting my band into place.The strap material is surrounded by rubber where you grip the handle. The rubber is fastened to the strap material so the strap cannot move/rotate under the grip material.

"This microwave introduces elements most of us microwave users have not seen before. Besides the usual microwave capability at varying power levels, this microwave has a grill heating element at the top of the microwave which you can use independently of the microwave, or you can use the ""Combi"" function which uses the grill element + microwave at 30% power. There is a grill rack you place on the regular turntable that stands about 4.25"" high so your food is lifted close to the grill element on top. You also get a ""crusty plate"" that you put food on on top of the rack that gets well-heated to help crisp up the bottom of foods touching the plate.- Cooking with Grill/Combi -One thing to note is you cannot change the temperature the grill element heats to. It doesn't get as hot as I need to get the foods really crisp. For example, I tried the recommended settings for frozen pizza (Totino's) and the result was a very lightly crispy crust - nowhere near the crispness from cooking in the oven. It did do a very good job cooking up crisp fish sticks from frozen. I was very happy with the way they came out. I was moderately happy with how the grill function managed to toast some bread. Though it was evenly browned, it seemed drier than toast out of a regular toaster. The grill element is good for drying things out, such as if making croutons. The grill element is only over the back half of the microwave. The food moves in and out from under the direct heat as the turntable rotates food around.- Dish Size -The grill element juts out about 1.75"" from the ceiling of the appliance so there is less room for dishes when using the regular microwave. Your dishes need to be about 7"" high or less to fit. The turntable has a diameter around 12.5"".- Other Comments -¬∑ There is a mesh lining to the door of the microwave but food is still viewable through it as the microwave cooks so I have no problem watching for spillovers.¬∑ This microwave has a +30 second button to easily add 30 seconds cooking time.¬∑ The ceramic interior retains heat well. I opened the microwave door 40 minutes after cooking something previously in ""Combi"" mode and felt a wave of warm air when I opened the door. I can see using this microwave as an excellent spot to leave dough to rise.¬∑ The door doesn't open past 90 degrees so it may stifle access depending on your kitchen layout.¬∑ The grill element is not removable and makes cleaning the ceiling above the element a tad cumbersome.¬∑ There is no note on the display nor backlit button to indicate and help remind you when you've pressed the ""Grill"" or ""Combi"" button to use those functions. There are days when I am so absentminded that though I pressed a button a fraction of a second in the past, I can't remember if I pressed it or not. Pressing ""Grill"" or ""Combi"" is pivotal if cooking with the metal grill rack in place since those settings do not use full microwave power. I would appreciate a reminder so I don't constantly second-guess myself and have to clear/redo settings to make sure as to avoid the mayhem of setting off a full power microwave with metal inside.I am loving the additional capabilities of this microwave. I sometimes wish for more variability in the ""Grill"" or ""Combi"" setting, but the settings provided are still useful and help me avoid firing up other bigger appliances to prepare my food.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZZ432LWQSMUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXRHIO8#wasThisHelpful","RZZ432LWQSMUA","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy the many textures in this Hello Kitty case. It makes the case more interesting to look at and feel. All the materials used feel high quality. The main outer red covering is canvas, the white face is a furry fabric. Facial details, pink bow, and outline are thread. The ""HELLO KITTY"" beneath the face is a raised hard rubber. The inside lining is a soft microfiber. A minor complaint I have for the case I received is the white furry face fabric has a few wavy ripples in it that comes from the way it was sewed against the red canvas backing. Either one of the materials was stretched or it was never laid out completely flat against each other before sewing together. The ripples are probably negligible to most people, but can drive a perfectionist mad.This case can accommodate a number of devices within a range of measurements since it uses elastic bands in the corners to hold the device instead of specific snap fittings. As long as your device is close to 4.5"" x 6.5"", you should be okay. The elastic bands are tight and hold my device very securely. The case allows for about .5"" thickness without affecting how the cover will lay flat. This is more than enough for my Kindle and I can still stuff a fair amount of notes in the front pocket without making my case look overstuffed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9S0AKQV2Z1P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O28ARPY#wasThisHelpful","R9S0AKQV2Z1P8","A2L35P0VQE7LBN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L35P0VQE7LBN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a really nice Logitech speaker system.1. What's in the box?:  You receive the speaker system.  This is a three piece system consisting of the subwoofer base, control system and the two speakers.2.  Aesthetic?:  The system is nice looking, but larger than might be anticipated.  Unlike the other two systems I have previously used, the system is not huge, but is aimed at providing sound towards the front.  The speakers system are not huge, but are not small.  This is a nice looking  system.3.  Use?:  This is entirely easy to set-up.  Simply plug the system together, and the system uses a headphone jack plug for a output.  The control panel is a big improvement from a previous system.  Why?  This is because my previous logitech system had a simple on/off button and a side dial.  This system uses a dial for volume control.As to the sound, it it quite good and there is lots of volume.  The sound is not the best speaker sound I have heard, but measures up quite well to superior computer speakers - surprisingly so.  The sound provided is quite loud as well.  In fact, the sound is so much, I do not havr to turn up the speakers very high to get lots of sound.Overall?:  This system is ideal for a simple solution for adding good sound to a computer or other system easily.  Since the output is just a jack, I would think any system could use this speaker system.  On the other hand, the decision is whether you require lots of sound volume.  If you don't require much sound, then this might be too much sound.  On the other hand, this provides lots of good sound.  The decision is whether the price point meets your need for a good system and very good sound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EYAN257FHKGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151K2AB0#wasThisHelpful","R3EYAN257FHKGD","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Easy to carry, easy to pack up again into a nice little package.All the positive reviews are not wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNGVSM5UVIE1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017168E6W#wasThisHelpful","RNGVSM5UVIE1E","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These ar.e basic wood hangars.  I bought these primarily based on price and previous good reviews.  I got 20 of these well packaged and ready to go.My main concern is basically whether these will last, are able to handle some weight and also the surface is smooth such that more delicate clothes.  These are not the highest quality hangars I have seen, but they are finished well enough.  If I was hanging some delicates like silk, I would recommend using  better quality hangars.  This is not because these aren't good enough, but rather because there are not really meant for delicates.  However, for most items, these will work just fine and do the job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J30U61IGG4IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPABCH6#wasThisHelpful","R3J30U61IGG4IZ","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item is a compact USB charger for a car.  The best two aspects of this charger are the small compact size and the neat design with the band of color rather than the simple point of light.This charger comes with a USB Micro-USB charger for Android phones and similar, although that is irrelevant because the cable is detachable.  Plus, this charger has two ports.  One port is a regular port, and there is a second quick charge port.  When the unit is charging with power, here is a nice blue glow around the band.  I like this touch a lot.Charging is easily done and without any problems.  I tried this with both micro-USB and Lightning cables as well and had no problems.For the money, this is compact, nice-looking and squat and does the job.  Worth the money for the easy use.(I received a sample of this item in return for an objective review, which I have provided).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R228ZE95AV5JV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013G5NN5O#wasThisHelpful","R228ZE95AV5JV7","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Lenox ornament that is shaped like a heart and has the word LOVE on one side.My first concern is whether this would be worth the money being charged for the item.  In this case, this appears to be a quality item used infrequently (during the holidays of course) and whether this will last.  On this score, I think so.  Provided no one drops this on the floor, this is going to be around a while.The ornament itself is pretty large, with the heart being probably the size of a hand palm.  It is larger than expected.  The words are printed in gold leaf (or something else resembling gold leaf - pyrite?) and it is nice looking.Overall, this is a neat looking ornament, appropriate for the season and considering the overall quality, designed to last for more than a few seasons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NIWAUCI79TI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFNJOTW#wasThisHelpful","R6NIWAUCI79TI","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy musicals both live, although I attend infrequently, but also from an affinity for the classic film musicals as well.  So, I thought this would be a great book both because of the subject material and because DK rarely disappoints.I was not wrong.  This a spectacular book.  Colorful, informative, well printed and a really expansive book.I am not enough of an expert to suggest whether the choices are the best ones, but from my perspective, these are mostly the obvious choices.  Whether the choices are definitive, that is a matter of view.  From my perspective, there really wasn't much missing here.I am really enjoying looking through this book, and am finding the combo of Broadway musicals, film musicals (including through the present) and bios of influential figures is great.  Plus, the pages list the songbooks and placement in a neat graphic as well. Sometimes standards are from musicals and I didn't even know it.  It is pretty neat to look through and find the music here.If you like musicals or know someone who does, this is a great book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNEVNH6W2UDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465438866#wasThisHelpful","R3RNEVNH6W2UDX","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice ornament.  Lenox is a good brand so I was excited to try out this item.  Obviously it is a bit before a tree is available.  However, this is a nice looking ornament that will last unless it drops onto a hard floor.  The angel is about palm size (perhaps a bit smaller) and is held by a gold twine line.This is a nice looking ornament that will last for a long time.  It costs about 10 dollars, but this isn't bad for a good porcelain ornament that is expected to last for years.  I love  it.

It appears that the liner can be washed, and while that it true, I would only wash this by hand in the sink.This is a really good product that fulfills a good need in showing a liner that is better than just having something.

"This is an item that may appear to be redundant.  However, upon receiving this item and using it, I am really impressed.First off, this box is a lot smaller than it may seem.  It so about the size of your palm.  It appears well-made and secure.  The box has some weight to it.  This is not a battery pack, so it must be plugged in.  Once plugged in, this box has 6 ports for charging items.  The 6th port is a quick charge port identified by the blue USB chip.I immediately used this on various items including three IOS devices and an Android device.  My first impression was that the items certainly did charge faster than the default USB ports.  This was especially true of the Ipad, which really charged very quickly.  The box handled the items very well and it did not feel hot after some hours of use.  That is a huge plus!I was really skeptical about this item at first, but I find myself wanting to use this instead of the Apple bubble for sure.  Secondly, I haven't really found this to get hot after charging items which is another huge plus.I can think for multiple items that need charging, whether cameras and associated equipment or for a family or simply something that allows 2 or more items to be charged this is a great little item.(Note: I did receive this item in exchange for an unbiased, objective review). That being said, this is a great little item!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDARCSQ7BVRFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01184JGYC#wasThisHelpful","RDARCSQ7BVRFH","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, these are really cool-looking swim goggles with the reflective design on the lens and the neat black appearance.  these goggles feel like a quality piece of hardware.Second, the important thing beyond the great looks is the performance.  Here, these googles have a great and comfortable fit on the lens with a nice silicon pocket. That is I had zero problems fitting these on my face and getting a excellent seal. Plus, the googles are really comfortable as well. Moreover, the goggles have a nice comfortable fit.  The band is a nice feeling silicon as well and the dual band system is easily adjustable.  However, there is a nice plug that allows the user to simply remove the plug and put the goggles around the head without having to pull these over the head, which would be really excellent for a female or those with long hair.Use?:  These are very nice goggles.  There are not competitive use goggles, but for daily swims, or for recreational use, these are really an excellent choice.  The lens are nice. I am not sure about anti-Uv protection per se, but the use is easy and the seal provided by the excellent lens rims are fantastic and eliminate much water coming into the eye socket.Overall:  Although I was not previously familiar with this manufacturer, I am very pleased by the quality construction and the easy use of these goggles.  Water does not easily seep into the eye socket, the wear is easy for most work-outs and these look great.Great item.(I did receive a pair of these goggles in return for my unbiased, objective review).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZSQ436X74VL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HTH57G#wasThisHelpful","RZSQ436X74VL6","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thule.  Probably the first thing that used to come to my mind is the great bicycle racks and similar items for kayaks and whatnot.  However, after buying and trying a few different backpacks, this company also makes excellent backpacks as well.This item is called a 'daypack' and it certainly is.  Why?  Because this item is fairly small in comparison to other Thule packs available.  This doesn't mean it isn't good, it juts means that it is smaller than most.First off, I received the 'Miami Dolphins' color scheme.  Okay, this has nothing to do with the Dolphins, but this pack is teal with orange accents.  It looks great, but it is not subtle at all.The quality of the item is terrific.  I was impressed how well things are put together and the little touches that exist.  Now, this is said to be a 21 liter pack.  Inside it has a main area with a small seperate pack area for pencils and other little items if you need that.  As well, there is what is called a crush-proof area for glasses and phones and the like.  There is no separate reservoir area for a waterpak in this model.There are some side areas and the back of the pack can be used to slip in a jacket or something similar.  There is also a nice small rear pocket as well.Since this is a real daypack, there is enough tight room for a small netbook or Ipad and similar items.  The pack itself is again not really built for long hikes, so the straps are nice, but this doesn't have lots of padding for items you might use on a long trip.  I do really like that you can slip water bottles on the sides as well.This is an excellent dapypack for a trip around sightseeing on a trip or similar type journeys.  In fact, it is pretty ideal for such a trip and just about perfect.  This is to lug around stuff for short trips and to do it easily.  Other more involved journeys would require a larger pack and this isn't suited to the job.Yes, this is an expensive item, and I might look askance at the price given the function.  On the other hand, this is the kind of purchase that will last forever with minimal care as my other Thule items have shown.  So, in this sense it is money well-spent.  Well-spent if you understand you are getting a daypack!Great item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LRK7K3O2Z5I3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8KC02Q#wasThisHelpful","R1LRK7K3O2Z5I3","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In other words, at this point, it doesn't seem that the cable will simply fall apart and be pulled with consistent use.

"This book was right in my wheel-house since the book discusses classic films and World War II.Mark Harris has written a book about a subject that needed to be written.  The five directors discussed here were well-known to me as a film buff because they all made some of the greatest films of all time.  I was also generally aware that all these directors had made various films in advancing the Allied cause.The five directors, Wyler, Stevens, Huston, Wyler and Capra all made pretty incredible films (incredible in the sense in these films are still watchable today (thanks youtube).  The narrative here is largely about Hollywood and the reaction to the buildup to war and then how the government, military and Hollywood moved forward to produce films and documentaries showing the Allied war effort.The risks that were taken are hard to be believed.  Wyler flew bombers to bring us the story (amongst others) of the Memphis Belle, for example.  Stevens entered the Dachau death camp and recorded such horrible scenes that those who saw the raw film were not only sickened but believed they had been there themselves such was the immediacy of the film.Overall:  I really liked this book a lot.  I ended up buying Harris' other book about the 1967 Best Picture nominees.  For those who enjoy stories of Hollywood (actual Hollywood - not the simulacra that passes for it now - with moguls, strong-will directors and stars) and enjoy watching TCM, then this is a must read.  Those interested in World War II may be slightly disappointed only because this is not really about World War II military history, but still worth reading, especially of you have seen the various films made by these directors (and again most are readily available on the internet).  Imagining actual combat being shown during the war and the horrible aftermath must have been a shock to the sheltered American populace during the war.  It is discussed here.A recommended book for film buffs for sure, and those interested in knowing more about the war effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ19QKNF6WDPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143126830#wasThisHelpful","RZ19QKNF6WDPO","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was not initially a book that I wanted to read because I am pretty familiar (I thought) with the three generals discussed here.  But I went ahead and read this book anyway.The author, Winston Groom, is the author of numerous books including Forrest Gump, which was a work of fiction.  However, what I didn't know was Groom has written a number of popular works of history and these have typically been well-received.The narrative here is about three important generals.  George Marshall, George Patton and Douglas MacArthur.  What I really liked about this book is the approach of discussing their biographies and their background before the Second World war even broke out.  I learned or was reminded of all kinds of interesting facts about these men.  MacArthur grew up on the plains with his father fighting the Indian Wars, Patton fought in Mexico, and all kinds of interesting little facts. Plus, I loved the discussions of the Mexican-American War, and World War I, plus the inter-war period.  There was so much history that was covered that is not part of any general discussion anymore.  For example, I learned about the bloodiest battle of American history - the Battle of the Arne forest - in which 27,000 Americans were killed.  There are lots of discussions of this kind of history in this fine book.Groom is clearly an excellent writer.  Why?  Because I read a significant portion of the book (the book is about 450 pages) without being cognizant of it.  This is an excellent general lay-readers history.  It is not the excellent Manchester book about MacArthur, nor the D'Este book about Patton. This book doesn't have to be, but those are excellent books about their particular subjects with lots of detail.  I only indicate that this is not a detailed work of biography aimed at those wanting a detailed read.  This is a work of general history that should appeal to a very wide audience that wishes for learning about these men in context of the history they lived through.Groom has given the book footnotes which is a good approach and gives the variety of books consulted.  As well, there is a generous number of maps (and there may be pictures but I reviewed an ARC so I can't state that definitively).Overall?:  There is a lot to like here about this book and narrative.  Groom is a good general historian and brings a very good approach to his subject.  I read through this book quickly and enjoyed it thoroughly. Well recommended for a general audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAR0XZ9ZIKLXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426215495#wasThisHelpful","RAR0XZ9ZIKLXJ","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this is a modem.  A basic piece of equipment absolutely needed, but basically it is like getting excited over a car axle when you have a car.That being said, this should be compared to two popular modem models that you can buy on Amazon.  Both of those I have actually tried and work well.Here, this modem is quite small.  Much smaller than the other popular model, this is about the size of a paperback book.The inputs are the ones expected.  The power adapter and the wall blister is one input, with the ethernet cable and cable connection being the others.Set-up:  Similar to other modems, you usually have to call (as I did) the provider and give them the MAC address and similar to provision the modem.  Then the modem is synced and should work.  This shouldn't be an issue with the provider but may depend on the carrier as well (Mine was certified for use by my provider however).  Once this is all done, take the ethernet cable and plug it into your router system.Use?:  This provides good speed and seems stable.  I can't really comment as yet as to overall performance, nor can I give an assessment as to long-term use.  But, I will provide an update(s) as I continue use of this item.  At this time, this modem, and TPLINK seems to have increased the quality of its items significantly.Overall:  So far, easily worth the money based on not leasing it from a provider.  Secondly, the items seems like a quality build as well.  Updates to be provided with more use.

"In received the opportunity to review this item.  I like the concept, and the execution is pretty darn good so far.1.  What's in the box?:  You receive the headphones, plus instructions and extra earbuds and ear plugs of various sizes.2.  Aesthetic?:  Well, first off, these are not headphones like I am used to because there run with Bluetooth and therefore have no cable running to the phone or other device.  So, these are functional items and therefore aren't really designed for looks per se.  However, these look well enough and the yellow hints here and there are nice enough.3.  Use?:  First off, after removal from the package, I like to try to use items without instructions.  This worked easily as I only had to press the control bud and the earbuds activated. The connection with my IOS phone was easy through bluetooth.  I heard verbal confirmation and everything was set.The first thing I did was listen to music.  The music soundstage was good, not great.  Therefore, I began to play with the various different earwings for inside the ear and different plugs.  The sound is good, not great.I downloaded the Jabra app and this provides a real in depth workout coach.  There is way more here than, say, Runkeeper os similar.  I am still working through this app and its application.  This app provides cadence for running or walking and other verbal clues for enhancing a work-out.  This app seems to provide a lot of support for various exercises and is something that appears to be very good.  (I will update this as I continue to try out the app during work-outs).  By the way, charging is done by moving the silicon cover and placing the micro-USB port inside.  Battery life is supposed to be about 5.5 hours, and this seems pretty accurate.  I must mention I love how I can listen to music while working out, and take and make phone calls by manipulating the control bud.  This is a great item for a busy active person.  Plus, I love the Bluetooth connectivity.  No more cable pulls and problems.Overall:  At this juncture, I really like the bluetooth connectivity.  This is terrific for an active person because no longer do you have to deal with the cable getting tangled during a work-out.  The app appears after some use to be useful.  This model does not have a heart-rate monitor (though personally I use another item which has this feature - if you don't be cognizant of this fact).  On the other hand, everything works well and easily.I wish the sound was better and more live.  The sound is not loud enough, which is okay for certain applications, but in some ways is disappointing.  This is a high quality item, clearly, and I have enjoyed using it thusfar.I am giving this 3.5 stars so far, it is probably 4 stars but I will update this with more extensive use.

"I was offered the chance to review these Wrangler shorts.The shorts themselves do not have any d-ring, so that picture I saw is inaccurate.  These have an elastic waist so that is a nice feature.  As well, the material is a lightweight canvas feeling.  These are relatively inexpensive shorts, and they are not the nicest shorts I have ever had.  However, these shorts are a good value for the money.  The matierial is lightweight, but tough.  There are the cargo-like pockets and these have velcro pulls to open and close.The shorts feel is true to size in that the waist is pretty close to what it should be.  The elastic provides a good cinch, but not too tight.

"I was familiar with the author and his father, as they both have written books about the Civil War and World War II.  I am a history buff, but I have never really read much about the Civil War itself.  This book, which is part of a series, and is really about the end stages of the war looked intriguing to me for a variety of reasons.First off, this is what I would call a massive novel.  It is really not a quick beach read over a few days.  But what is here is well worth absorbing.  What Shaara has done has taken both the federal side, from the general (in this case Sherman, down to individual soldiers and done the same for the confederates.  The reader gets the perspective of what was happening from the end of Sherman's March to the Sea, and the pursuit of the confederates through Georgia and the Carolinas.The book does not really require extensive (or really any knowledge of the end stages of the Civil War.  Yet, I did fell inspired to look to the internet to see how the end came for the confederates.  The book does a good job of taking the reader through this period and does so in a convincing manner.  It took me a bit of reading to 'get into' the book, but the narrative is more than compelling enough to have kept me reading through.  This was personally a fascinating bit of history for a variety of reasons, and Shaara has enough characters to be able to relate the story very well.Worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35P5ZV14FC3T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549198#wasThisHelpful","R35P5ZV14FC3T8","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another book I was inclined to want to read through about how Navy Seals are put through their paces and are able to speak to accomplishing goals.Of course, this book discusses a variety of battles in Iraq as illustrations of dealing with various issues while trying to accomplish various goals.What is interesting about this book, and the others in this genre, is that the authors are typically able to relate the discussion into a larger point of leadership.n here, the authors do a nice job of doing this frequently.This book has plenty of discussions of battles in Iraq that should capture attention.  But, the larger points of leadership, group ethics, accountability and the like are also well discussed.  This book is well worth reading on leadership and is also an exciting read as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8D2IX3VQ6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067057#wasThisHelpful","R2V8D2IX3VQ6H","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Wright Brothers are such an inspiring story, an inspiring American story.  I recall reading in awe of their efforts as a kid, and the discussion of their efforts in the age of invention along with Edison and others at the turn of the century.  Truly, I am astonished about how they applied ingenuity to their efforts and designed something so brilliant and yet something so simple, like many great inventions.The great writer David McCullough has written a relatively short (for him) biography of these two brothers, their family,  and their amazing invention.This was a book that I blew through in just a few sittings.  This is not a boom fills with technical details on the engineering or the flights, so if that is what you want look elsewhere.  Instead this is a story of how this family invented something we take for granted today.As with most of McCullough's books, this is a well-written account of history that you may know something about, but you will still learn a lot and enjoy it thoroughly.  I would recommend getting the hardcover version for the many fine and well-printed photographs in the book.Well worth reading and recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWYPB93ONI4UK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476728747#wasThisHelpful","RWYPB93ONI4UK","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read a few books by Robert Reich and generally enjoyed them.  His book ""Locked in the Cabinet"" is probably one of the greatest expositions on serving as a secretary (in his case in Secretary of Labor during the first Clinton term) and dealing with a government bureaucracy as exists.  Moreover, his book The Work of Nations was also a very interesting book about how the economy was changing on the 1990's.  And, a lot of his descriptions have turned out to be accurate.  Of course, I also read a book he wrote on the 1980's about how Japan was going to rule the world.  That book was a product of it's time and was pretty incorrect in many ways.In that context, I was offered the chance to read through and review an advance copy of the book.  If you have an interest in economic issues that is aimed for the general lay-reader, this is a valuable and interesting read.  Reich's critique is aimed at showing how the American landscape is changing in ways perceptive people realize or perhaps don't realize.  This includes the real implosion of the middle class, the rise of tremendous economic inequality and the changing American economy.In addition, Reich discusses the financial system as benefiting the investment class and the idea of the rigged game.  Finally, Reich offers ideas on how to counteract this system that he believes is failing the bulk of Americans, such is raising the minimum wage.Now, personally I would agree with many of Reich's descriptions and I enjoyed the narrative.  But, I largely disagree with his prescriptions on addressing these issues.  But, I think if you disagree with Reich (and he is often skewered), this is still a worthwhile book.  It isn't 800 pages (a very manageable 200 + pages) and I still was challenged and learned things.Overall, this is a valuable read and a good critique of what certainly is affecting the economy and how a large segment of Americans are suffering.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19B7V4LCIDXEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350570#wasThisHelpful","R19B7V4LCIDXEC","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I previously tried another type of dog food from Honest Kitchen for dogs.  I thought my dog really liked that type.  Here, this is a similar type of food and here my dog had a similar reaction.This food is turkey and parsnip plus other items.  The food is essentially freeze-dried and offered so that you simply add water, or I have added the food to dry food as a supplement as well.  As with any food, my dog did not immediately react as if this was a great addition.  However, after a few tries my dog did respond and seemed to enjoy the food (although it does seem that the dog prefers the other flavor more).  Though this is alleged to be human-grade, I didn't try it myself.  But, perhaps in an emergency, it is comforting I could eat it. I am not planning on it!The bag is sufficient for a number of meals and this manufacturer really does seem to be cognizant of the ingredients.  Therefore, there is no filler or unnecessary grains or other such stuff that lesser brands put in.  Also, this is made in the US and apparently does not utilize anything from non-American sources.Therefore, this is a good value on several fronts.  Also, I think that this is a great item to carry on hiking trips because you can carry this food and simply add water to give your dog a good meal that isn't as heavy as carrying around kibble or cans.Overall, this is another very good product from this company.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XF9CEYW2DOR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBI9DYU#wasThisHelpful","R1XF9CEYW2DOR5","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The new rage (and in many ways this is a positive thing) is the way of the Navy Seal.  No, this trend is not about becoming the next warrior, but it is about the various leadership techniques that the Seals seem to impart.That being said, this is not your usual book written by a former CEO, but rather by a former SEAL.  Therefore, the leadership discussion involves dealing with issues like accountability, team, ethics and other items which are about how to advance a group towards completing a goal.The book has plenty of discussions of various 'adventures' in military objectives that provide learning lessons.What I appreciated about this very well-written book is the various discussion about how these warrior teams accomplish goals.  The book IS inspiring, and besides implementing these techniques in a professional world, these are items that also are helpful in a personal context.I greatly enjoyed this book, I felt inspired by the stories told, and the leadership techniques are very useful.  This is not the only book I have read in the genre, but everyone I have come across is helpful in its own way and that should be instructive on its own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22S0YPLOQGIDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071844880#wasThisHelpful","R22S0YPLOQGIDE","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge fan of Sennheiser headphones and have purchased this brand for a while, including a previous iteration of sport headphones.This headphone is for sporting activities such as running, hiking, walking and the gym.  The particular model I tested was for Iphone and IOS based systems.1. What's in the box?:  You receive the headphones, which are wrapped up and ready to go, plus instructions in multiple languages that are really graphics-based, plus a attachment clip and a really useful mesh bag.2.  Aesthetic?:  Since there are designed to be for sport, these headphones are really designed to be sporty.  Therefore, I received the jaunty grey, white and mint green version.  As far as the design, there are really quite nice looking and feel like a quality construction.  The cord is green, which in my mind helps with night identification along with rear headband which is white and is probably reflective (though I cannot confirm this at this moment).These headphones look like what they were designed to do and look nice.  I like the chrome touches inside the earbuds as well!3.  Use?:  Well, my first impression was the flat cord which is a good length for putting the phone in the pocket while doing activities and it is long enough for even taller people (though not NBA types).  The cord is tangle-free apparently, and it appears this is accurate.Fit?:  I suppose I have regular dimensions because I found the fit to be comfortable and fine in terms of placing the band around my head and putting the buds in my ears.  There is a slight pinch, but I found this to be minimal and not the worst I have experienced ever.  However, of you are very sensitive to having even the slightest pressure around your head, you may want to try a different approach.Overall, I found the fit to be more than adequate and to my mind necessary to ensure the headphones don't just drop out during use.  I haven't experienced the idea that this becomes painful, but perhaps others might.Sound?:  I consider myself sensitive and wanting good sound.  On the other hand, I also consider the standard Apple headphones pretty adequate for sound so judge my opinions accordingly.  Here, these are sport headphones, so I want good basic sound, but I do not want isolation because that could be dangerous.  Moreover, these phones are not for an audiophile experience.I tried the sound out using the music on my phone and Ipod.  I found the overall music quality to be more than adequate.  By that I mean I found the quality to be pretty excellent with most every form of music considering the purpose of the headphones.  The music sounds live enough and on listening to music without activity, the quality is pretty excellent considering.  I would expect that the phones require some burn-in period and I have not reached that yet (some hours of listening) but based on initial listening experiences, the music is well-distributed.  There is not a excess of bass (hip-hoppers and metal-bangers should look elsewhere), but rather a pretty good balanced approach to the music without moving into the audiophile category.IOS controls?:  The controls here work well for the IOS system.  I found no issues with manipulating the music and voice control in whatever method I wanted.  The instructions were pretty clear in terms of the various button presses, but if you have used these controls before, the responses are pretty standard as here.Overall?:  My only concern about these headphones are given the price.  Sennheiser is probably the best brand I have found for headphones (though Klipsch and others are very good as well) so the quality seems like it be present.  However, these are might expensive.  There is one cable point with the tangle-free cable to the left ear and everything seems like it is built robustly.  So, this is a choice of price point. On the other hand, since the active headphones are typically a purchase needing some quality, this is not way out of line.On the whole, these are an excellent pair of headphones.  I will update this review as I continue to put the headphones through their paces with lots of exposure to tough conditions.  So far, I would be very happy if I had purchased these phone,  It appears that there is a good balance between sound and use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSF8J44HKIQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRRTO5O#wasThisHelpful","RLSF8J44HKIQA","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not previously familiar with this brand.  Upon receiving this case, my impressions were that the case is very nice, robust and can take some damage.1.  What's in the box?:  You receive the case and that is about it.  There is no screen protector.2.  Aesthetic?:  The looks of the case are quite nice.  This is a two part shell, with a tough silicon inner protector and then the external second shiny plastic shell.  The item looks nice, to be sure.3.  Use?:  Placing the phone into the inner shell is quite easy.  Since it is silicon, it just slips into the shell, then the hard plastic shell goes on. As far as it goes, the case provides protection.  Although I didn't perform a drop test, the case is certainly thick enough to provide a cushion.The button ports work fine, and the access on the bottom is adequate enough to work, especially for power.  So overall, this is a fine, adequate case.  However, I did notice that the shiny outer shell gets scratched quite easily.  In fact, barely after using the case, the outer shell is already pretty dinged up.  This is disappointing, and it does not appear that there is a protective foil to pull off (if there is - and I doubt it - I see no evidence of it). So, this case will get beat up through regular use.Overall?:  This is a good, not great Iphone 6 case.  The case seems as though the phone will be protected, but it is disappointing that the outer shell get so easily dinged up.  I grade this about 3.5 stars.  Not bad at all, but not great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZE1IMA7JVTTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U85FVH4#wasThisHelpful","R1ZE1IMA7JVTTB","A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I decided it was time to upgrade from the mini glue guns that I kept wearing out and I decided on this reasonably priced model.  I spent the weekend trying to work it to death and it performed beautifully.Keep in mind that you have to buy the full size glue sticks that are .44 inches in diameter.  The mini glue sticks will NOT work.  I know because I tried and all it did was glob up the glue gun.I like that the gun has an indicator light so you know when it is heated and ready to go.

"This is a very pretty jewelry set consisting of one pair of drop earrings, one necklace, and one bracelet.The set that I received is the fuchsia colored crystal and looks exactly as the picture shown.  This is very nice jewelry that I will have no problem wearing to dressy occasions, to work, or just out for a good time.Both the necklace and the bracelet have extender chains, which is nice because my wrist is larger than average.  The reason I rated only four stars is because of the clasps.

"I had high hopes for this glue gun as I had read several reviews and it was highly rated.  I have already worn out two of the $3 models and I thought it was time to get a ""real"" glue gun so I purchased the Surebonder HE-750.Unfortunately, I could not get it to dispense any glue from the nozzle.  I turned it on, inserted a glue stick, and waited.  Nothing.  So I waited some more.  Still nothing.  I gave it a little push because that always helped get my other glue gun started and the glue stick melted inside the gun but would not come out of the nozzle.I returned it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLM0VP0NOEY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009XTPAO#wasThisHelpful","RTLM0VP0NOEY7","A27D5LZ7ZVK51T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27D5LZ7ZVK51T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was having a lot of trouble sleeping so I was thrilled to get a complimentary bottle of Zenwise Labssleep support supplement to try out in exchange for my unbiased review, which I am happy to provide here.I took two of the easy to swallow capsules the first night and fell asleep promptly. Sometime duringthis restful night of sleep I dreamed I gave birth to eight kittens. It was a hoot.  The hospital dubbed me Octo Meow,I was on TV, got my picture in the papers, etc., and although I was somewhat shocked, they were cutekittens and everything seemed well with the world.I awoke the following morning thinking wow, what a strange dream, and forgot about it until I noticedthe eight kittens sleeping at the foot of my bed. Hmmm... I already own two  spayed adult cats, and I knowthey weren't responsible for this situation, but all I could think was that having eight kittens is certainly betterthan having eight kids (sheesh!!). But what else to do but suck it up and get on with life.And like I said, they were cute kittens and even though I had to invest in several more cat trees and my BlueBuffalo bill went sky high, we are all fine.  All's well that ends well, so they say.Of course I was exhausted after the kitten incident, so the next night I took two more of the sleepingaids and went to bed early just needing a good night's sleep.The next morning I woke up in the local cemetery where I had been sleeping in an empty coffin in themausoleum. I was wearing a black cape, white shirt, and red tie -- clothing items that I don't even own.I got a lot of weird looks walking home at 6 a.m., especially since Halloween is over and all.But after a nice shower and rare steak for breakfast, I managed to make it to work on time.I can't even go into the third night right now. It was just too traumatic. All I can say it those zombiesare creepy and I know I'll never see those kittens again.But hey, I'm sleeping great. No problems at all other than a little heartburn. Don't be an idiot like meand take your pills right before you lie down -- take them an hour or so before you go to bed.Sweet dreams!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10EPX9GS3KTRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YVTAOES#wasThisHelpful","R10EPX9GS3KTRZ","A27D5LZ7ZVK51T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27D5LZ7ZVK51T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It will keep your skin soft and is wonderful for healing sunburns and other small cuts and scrapes.I highly recommend this product and I use it all the time.I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.

"Wow, what a great idea!  I have used silicone muffin cups and I have a collapsible silicone colander, but this is my first experience with silicone baking mats.I love the fact that things don't stick to these mats.  They are especially useful if you like to bake cookies.  I will definitely be purchasing more of the large ones for the holiday season.The set includes a large rectangle, a smaller rectangle, and a square -- three mats in all.  The large one is great for cookie sheets and large baking pans.  Also makes clean-up a breeze.  Just rinse and wipe.I highly recommend these for anyone who does a lot of baking.  I also used one when I baked a pork tenderloin and it was so easy to clean up afterwards.

Unfortunately, Pantry items ship via U.S. mail and they will not deliver to my door -- they leave packages at the apartment office.

"Someone is going to think I'm being paid to leave glowing reviews of all of this authors books.  But that wouldn't be true, they are each so great I just can't help myself.  This actually ended up being one of my favorites.  I liked reading the continuation of some of the other characters from previous novels.  Don't worry you can read it as a stand alone.  Both of the main characters grew And matured so much in this story.  I loved how they each learned to face their fears and move past them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSSX2JPXZCRGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XXOB4GE#wasThisHelpful","RSSX2JPXZCRGJ","A348AAXO1D384T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A348AAXO1D384T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love love love this bench. I am so glad that I bought it.  My husband put it together for me in under an hour. All of the pieces were intact and in good condition. I was really surprised at how well the molding was done as it was on the front and the back. This piece is not made from particleboard but rather wood. I would concur with the other reviewer's that the piece they put on the bottom inside is inadequate for storage.  I totally love the look of this.  I have it inside my mud room for my kids to sit on to put shoes on. Two kids can easily sit at side-by-side on it.  The storage is fairly deep if you can fix the inside so it's a little stronger. I just think it's adorable and I am so glad that I bought it.

"I have enjoyed this entire series of book about 7 boys all adopted into the same family.  I anxiously await what the author will come up with as her next series.  I enjoyed this book.  It's a sweet clean romance.  I will say, however that this book for me wasn't as good as some of the others.  I didn't feel that there was enough conflict in the story to heighten my emotions.  You had two very sweet nice people that fell in love.  The little bit of conflict they had was easily and quickly resolved.  Overall I left this book feeling happy with its conclusion.  I appreciated that at the end of the story the author included a bit about each of them he brothers and where they were at in their lives.  If you are reading the series I wouldn't skip this book but as a stand alone id personally choose one of the other books in the story.

They each had their own weaknesses and it was good to see them face challenges and overcome with love.  I appreciate that these books going to bad language or sex scenes.

I like that there was a strong attraction between the characters in this book but the book stayed sweet and clean.  I didn't think I'd like the main character as she viewed her marriage as her job.

"I love this author but I must confess to dragging my feet about reading it.  Something about a man with a dark past as the hero didn't appeal to me.  I'm so glad I  decided to give it a try.  It's an amazing book.  I felt like I grew just by reading it.  It made me think about what might drive someone to do something dreadful and how they would feel trying to be back on the straight and narrow with others still passing judgement.  I loved the side characters in this story and their encouragement and love.  The heroines story in this book also has such depth.  It was amazing how she learned to handle her own past with grace and love.  It was amazing to watch these two hearts come together and there story was s slow build that ended in a fantastic way.  I loved that characters from previous stories were woven into this so you could see how their story progressed.

"This is a great story if you are looking for a romance that is about true unconditional and forgiving love.  For this Id give it high marks.  However I've landed somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star review.  The main female character is so lost and causes so much hurt to her husband and child.  Yet they love her and forgive her with ease.  We really all should live as these characters do, yet because of human nature it makes it hard to believe.

"I'll be honest this author always perplexes me.  Her stories are just so out of the box and different.  In one sense that's a great thing because I read a lot and her books are truly one of a kind.  In another sense at times its a little too different and I have a hard time finding the characters relatable.  I really enjoyed this story for the first half.  The last half I found a little slow going and the ending seemed abrupt.  Still the romance is truly touching and I give two thumbs up for creativity.  I also wonder why the author referenced the main character possibly going to the synagogue when she is looking for a new church.  That was confusing to me as synagogue is usually for Jewish people and the character is a Christian.  I even looked it up on Wikipedia because I was curious about her use of terminology.

Both characters have a lot of growth as the story progresses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CN7CC40YTDVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWBZQSA#wasThisHelpful","R1CN7CC40YTDVI","A348AAXO1D384T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A348AAXO1D384T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I Was very pleased with this purchase.  I found the pillows I ordered to be true to the color displayed on my ipad screen.  The linen looking  fabric was nice and thankfully soft to the touch and not wrinkly at all.  There was no smell to the packaging which I often find with things priced like this.  I mean what a deal for less than $5 a pillow.  I will warn that the zippers on mine were a little narrower than the pillow is wide and as I'm not a handy or craft girl I found it a a tiny bit difficult to get them stuffed.  I did try stuffing mine with fill at first and again due to my lack of handy abilities mine just looked lumpy.  So I'm going with an actual pillow insert.  I am  Super pleased with the purchase.

"When one of my friends turns 40 I often will buy one of these little tiaras to help them celebrate their big day.  It always brings a smile to the recipient and let's face it getting older isn't always easy.  Of the tiaras I've ordered this was by far the nicest one.  I've been happy with the rest but this one is actually good quality not just a gag gift.  It's a nice metal vs. Plastic.  It is well presented Ina really nice black box making it feel like more fancy.  The only down side is that as other reviewers pointed out you really do have to wear it back on your head.  It is not flexible at all and it won't work out any other way.  I thought it looked great that way so I really didn't mind.

I have little interest in historical fiction and zero interest in time travel books typically.  This books fits in both categories and I LOVED it.  I fell upon reading the first in the series and I am fully hooked on this author.  She has a superb writing style.  I worried that a third book in this series would become repetitive but the characters all felt new and fresh.

I tend to like light reading best where I can totally escape from the worries of life but I love this author.  And she didn't disappoint in this story.  I loved that the story wAstold Ina way that you could see what was occurring from several points of views.  All of the characters were admirable, and yes, even the teenagers who ended up with a pregnancy on their hand.  The book makes you think a lot about passing quick judgements, about how welcoming we are to others, and also about getting stuck in a place where we think we know what we want most in our lives but How God can have bigger and better plans.

I've debated a 3 or 4 star review on this book.  Although amazon views a 3 star rating as an unfavorable review, I see it more for a middle of the road book.  I don't regret reading this book.  It had some good moments and the characters were all sweet-- especially the aunt.  It is a Christian book, but It doesn't have a very strong faith elements so most people could enjoy it,Christian or not.  I think for me I found some of the characters actions stiff and unrealistic.  I didn't understand why the two main characters who were supposedly in love behaved in such an awkward way to each other.  I guess I didn't feel like they were that in love based on their interactions although I did admire how the male lead changed his path to one where he could act faithfully and have more time to build relationships.

I'll be honest that the description of the book didn't appeal to me that much although I liked the cover. I'm glad I gave this book a try. There are some great Christian elements in this book however I believe anyone could enjoy it regardless of their faith.  Happy reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TO0HWIGCKDBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1UEBYQ#wasThisHelpful","R2TO0HWIGCKDBS","A348AAXO1D384T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A348AAXO1D384T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this cute sweet romance novel.  I'll even admit to getting a bit teary in parts of the story.  I admired the main characters tenacity and joy in life.  I was happy there was an actual plot to this romance and no sex scenes.  It was just a sweet little story and it made me feel happy to read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PXHPZNB49VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009QUPWVC#wasThisHelpful","R19PXHPZNB49VW","A348AAXO1D384T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A348AAXO1D384T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ill be honest, I read about 60% of this book then quit.  It wasn't bad exactly but for me it seemed that all of the characters acted in ways that were totally unrealistic.  For example, Being a mother myself i can't imagine turning my child's welfare over to someone I haven't even seen in ten years.  Because of these odd situations I couldn't connect.  I guess honestly I like a good escape any day but this didn't seem likely.  I do appreciate that the story had a Christian message.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387IEKRWEIS9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPSM8E0#wasThisHelpful","R387IEKRWEIS9R","A348AAXO1D384T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A348AAXO1D384T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I did feel her relationship developed too rapidly especially his feelings considering he didnt recall their past.

"Very warm and very bright, these bulbs are a nice replacement for incandescent bulbs.  I was offered to review these since I frequently buy light bulbs.  I've tried a lot of different styles and brands.  I'm not happy with the quality of light of many and the price of others. These moderately priced bulbs give off a very nice light.  They work well with my dimmers without noticeable flickering that some LEDs bulbs are troubled by.  One reviewer commented these bulbs were bright enough to read by even when dimmed.  That is certainly not the experience in my home.  Personally, I'm not reading by a 60w bulb anyway, I prefer something brighter.

"Tiny, very portable, and easy to use. Arrives in premium packaging, so its a little like opening up an iPhone or iPod. Set up is a breeze and the free app is useful and slick. The app wants a little more personal information than it deserves (my height, weight and birth date), so clearly the company is sneaky and obtaining some information on me, probably for marketing purposes. Works great with my iPhone 6.The smartphone app records and graphs your glucose giving you a nice visual display of your diabetic management without any extra work. The strips themselves are fine. The strips require .7 ml of blood which is marginally higher than other strips requiring .5. or .6 ml, but this really isn't a noticeable different. The current price on Amazon is 25 cents per strip. That is about what most strips cost retail, but you can find them for 17 cents per strip or less for other meter systems. Reducing the cost of test strips by 1/3 may be not be trivial to some people, you need to decide for yourself. An additional 8 cents a strip is worth the convenience of the automatic graphing of the results to me, but I guess it really depends upon how many strips per day you use and how fixed your budget may be. Also, the graph probably isn't that useful if your glucose is well-controlled and varies little between tests. If you are actively managing your glucose, the graph is invaluable in recognizing patterns to help you adjust medication, diet, or lifestyle as the case may be. Recommended, although marginally more expensive to operate than some other meters are.A few reviewers have complained about battery life.  It arrives with two included batteries, but each failed after only a few uses.  However, a fresh battery has lasted for many weeks and is still going strong.

"This is about the size of an iPhone 6.  It arrived fully charged and ready to go!  It recharges quickly and has enough energy to get my iPhone 6 back to full power.  I can charge my iPad Air to about half.  The external battery strength indicator is an appreciated upgrade over my previous external batteries.  Typically, I carry them in a bag awaiting the ""emergency"" opportunity, but never really know how my charge they still hold.  This unit has a 1 to 4 light display to tell you strength.  Overall, recommended without reservations.

"In the now crowded genre of books about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, most can be divided into either first person narratives of the soldiering or analytical treatises about the conflicts.  This book is unique from the others that I've read in that it is not merely the perspective of the ""boots on the ground"" nor is it an overly academic and sterile analysis.  Nearly every American already has an opinion about these conflicts and many are searching merely for validation of their opinion, albeit pro or con, red or blue.  As such, this book will disappoint all, since it not a purely partisan propaganda piece.  However, for the curious reader searching to insight rather than validation, this is an excellent book.  You'll be wiser and better informed for reading it.

"In the crowded genre of business leadership books, this book fills an interesting niche.  This book takes a generational perspective and is intended for Millennials.  There is a generational difference in attitude and expectations and this will inevitably affect leadership style.  The old ways are certainly dated and the old school values of individual responsibility and self-reliance are not as ingrained in a connected generation more focused on cooperation and group work.  This is not inherently a good or bad thing, but a change that is best acknowledged and accommodated for. I am not a Millennial, but a staunch Baby Boomer with indelible Boomer values.  However, as I find myself in a leadership position over an increasingly Millennial population, I found this book intriguing and helpful. Millennials need different leadership styles.  This was a great read which required reading a chapter and then setting the book aside to reflect and process the information. It is useful not only for Millennials rising to leadership, but aging Boomers clinging to leadership over Millennials with different values. Well worth the time for both rising Millennials and for old dogs looking to learn new tricks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CXOSV5YV2D7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062323318#wasThisHelpful","R2CXOSV5YV2D7G","A1F8ABPW3WRF6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F8ABPW3WRF6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The unit is well-constructed and attractive and will blend in with most desk decors.  Its design is reminiscent of an iPhone or iPod.  There is only one button, which controls on and off and light intensity.  This is currently just one version in the Philips family of these lights.  It must be plugged in and does not have a battery function like its more expensive siblings which might be a drawback for some users.  It also doesn't have a clock like the Philips HF3332 goLITE BLU rechargeable, but I see this as an advantage since the design is much sleeker and more esthetically appealing. On its lowest setting it is quite bright, the other two settings are actually uncomfortably bright for my tastes.  The data underpinning light therapy for seasonal affective disorder is fairly robust, but I cannot honestly say that I have noticed a difference in my mood.  I also acquired this more for curiosity than an actual need to improve my mood.  A more symptomatic individual may have more benefit.  Interesting, the directions state the unit is contraindicated for individuals suffering from bipolar disorder.  A quick search on the Internet reveals there is some data that light therapy may induce mania is susceptible individuals.  This unit is recommended for individuals seeking light therapy for seasonal affective disorder, but the manufacturer's caution not to use for individuals with bipolar disorder should be heeded.

"Nice bathroom floor mat.  The stone blue is a muted color, sort of a bluish grey.  Although blue is not within the earth tone palate strictly-speaking, this mat has an almost earth tone quality to its color.  If you don‚Äôt want the bold circus colors often offered for the bathroom, this is a plus.  The popcorn surface is absorbent and comfortable.  Most important to me, unlike some similar mats it does not retain the impression of the foot as the surface springs back up.  I dislike the appearance of footprints on a bath mat, since this detracts from the clean appearance of the bathroom.  The sizes offered are accurate, but I would urge the potential purchaser to pay close attention to them.  17‚Äùx24‚Äù is relatively small for a bath mat.  If you‚Äôre looking for a small mat near your tub, shower, or sink, this is fine.  If you‚Äôre looking for a larger mat to cover an area of the bathroom, the larger size is probably more appropriate for most bathrooms.

She gobbled it down and then proceeded to stare at me (refer to photo, please) as if I was a lowly servant who was being waaay too slow with her second helping.So, to make a long cat nap short, Mittens approves of Solid Gold.

"First problem: After opening the fancy packaging I find there are NO INSTRUCTIONS included. None.So, I assumed the wipes numbered 1 and 2 are the numerical steps to take before installing the shield. But, what do I do with the sticker that says ""Dust absorber""? Do I do this before or after wiping? And, the 3 sticky tabs that read ""Guide sticker""?Using my noggin, and a little common knowledge that comes with using various screen protectors over the years, I used the dust absorber after wiping down the screen. Then, I removed the screen protector itself from the packaging and attached 2 of the guide stickers to the non-sticky side and lowered the protector onto my phone screen. It attached easily and I was thrilled.But, why do I give this only 2 stars? That's my Second Problem: The protector did not stick to the bottom of my screen. It looked like a large bubble at the bottom. Even after consistent pressing, the bubble didn't go away. So, I lifted the end of the screen and reattached it. Bad move. I have a larger bubble on the bottom and now there is one in the corner. Even after applying the weight of a heavy book overnight, the bubbles are still there.The protector feels tough and the screen senses my touch during use, but I hate the look of the bubbles. And, I'm pretty sure dust will accumulate under it.It makes me wonder if this would have turned out differently if it came with instructions.DAY 2: Now the bubble is hovering over the bottom third of my screen and is probably moving upward as I type.

"I‚Äôm not going to go into all the details concerning the test trials that went on in my house concerning the Poo-Pourri. I can sum up the scientific testing in a couple of words: Teenage boys. The results? It works.The directions are very very simple. Shake before use. Spritz the bowl BEFORE use. It recommends 3-5 spritzes but because we have the citrus-scent, which is very strong, only 1 spritz is needed. Otherwise, you are trapped on the throne with the overpowering smell of lemons that will overpower and make you pass out if you keep breathing.The bottle is a fun read while you are just sitting there doing your thing. It‚Äôs got a limerick, some amusing instructions, and I love the measuring window on the side of the bottle that lets you know how soon you need to replace it or reach ‚ÄúThe end of your reign‚Äù. It lasts a long time so the price is affordable.We‚Äôre having trouble with our bottle leaking and so not only does our bathroom smell like a lemon grove, so do our hands.

"Able to capture unbelievably clear and beautiful pictures or videos, the DxO ONE digital camera is an amazing development in photography. Easy to use, easy to download, and small enough to fit in your pocket, this camera is amazing. As this is the prototype, I can see that future models will only improve in quality of picture and ease of use.The camera is both an attachment for your iPhone or iPad and it can function on it‚Äôs own. About the size of the earlier GoPro cameras, the DxO connects to your iPhone with the flip of a switch. Unfortunately, I have to remove my phone case to attach the device. The connection is secure because it‚Äôs a hard pull when it comes time to disconnect it, but it still feels a tad wiggly. And because connecting the two devices results in an unbalanced-feeling camera, it‚Äôs easier to transport with them unattached. It took a bit of use for me to remember the lens is on the DxO and not on my phone camera. When you use it to take a selfie, it reminds you to ‚ÄúSmile. Look at the camera lens.‚ÄùThe photos can be stored on your phone, computer, or on the micro SD card that comes with the camera. Any videos need to be downloaded onto a computer.It comes with a lanyard attachment site but no lanyard. I highly recommend applying one.It needs frequent recharging as the battery is quickly used up. And, it becomes warm very fast. In fact, I was using it to film a band one night and after 13 minutes the thing was HOT and a thermometer icon started flashing. Because I didn‚Äôt want to ruin it, I turned it off. So, that is a big drawback and a problem that I‚Äôm sure later models will solve.When it comes to use without your iPhone, it becomes a bit tricky because there is no viewing lens on the DxO. You have to point and shoot and hope you aimed correctly. But it‚Äôs not hard to guess because the camera itself is so small.When you look at the photos on your iPhone be patient, as they will initially appear blurry, then the photo will power up and look fabulous. You can‚Äôt do true close-up shots and actually you don‚Äôt need to. The picture it takes can be enlarged and cropped and the results are amazingly clear and unpixelated. I didn‚Äôt need to use my flash when I was taking photos in a darkened nightclub because the DxO used the ambient lighting and the shots were clearer than the iPhone shots.So, while this is an amazing device and the pictures are spectacular, there are still a few wrinkles DxO needs to iron out. Is this worth $600? The technology might be, but the execution is not. Using the DxO with your iPhone is an awkward process and as a singular camera, again, there is no viewing lens. But, I have included a few shots to show the incredible results you get. The bumblebee is my favorite.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMA0XKVZD5BZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ALWJA8#wasThisHelpful","RMA0XKVZD5BZE","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After finishing Leigh Bardugo‚Äôs epic series, The Grisha Trilogy, I was sad to see it come to an end because it was so engaging and beautifully written and I knew I would miss the Darkling. Now Bardugo has come out with another series set in the same world, same time as the Grisha but with a whole new set of characters. And you know what? I hate to say this, it might even be considered blasphemy, but I found myself more engaged, more fascinated, more intrigued, and utterly in love with these new characters. And the story? It has more twists and set backs and game changing moments than any book I have ever read. It‚Äôs intoxicating and fast-paced and you need to pay attention or you‚Äôll miss Bardugo‚Äôs multiple sleight of hand tricks. Nothing is what it seems.The Grisha Trilogy had the Darkling; mysterious power-hungry megalomaniac that he was, all readers agreed the man was sexy. In this series, we get Kaz; greedy, dangerous, deceptive Bastard of the Barrel that he is, despite all his faults and one very weird but ultimately understandable phobia, the man is criminally sexy. Emphasis on criminal, by the way. He‚Äôs the guy you make eye contact with in a dive bar who makes you shiver, but you know that taking him home would be one huge, but memorable, mistake.Anyway, the story is all about the art of the con and is told from multiple viewpoints, which Bardugo expertly masters. Five con artists, led by Kaz, stand to make enough money to buy them out of whatever debt or indenture or brothel or sorry mess they call life if they pull off a most impossible heist. Keeping all the details of the plan close to his ever-present vest, Kaz hires a spy he calls The Wraith, a sharpshooter with a gambling problem, a Grisha Heartrender, a soldier who wants to kill the Grisha, and a rich kid with a penchant for explosives. Combining their various talents, they intend to break into the world‚Äôs most impenetrable prison and kidnap the scientist responsible for the dangerous drug that I‚Äôll just refer to as ‚ÄúGrisha meth‚Äù.If all the main characters in Six of Crows weren‚Äôt teenagers, this would definitely read as adult fiction. I never regarded any of them on the same level as the pimply-faced immature high schoolers that run around in my house. All the characters have a hard luck story or monumental event that made them grow up fast. Throughout the book we learn their personal stories, some are incredibly sad and unfair. But, in the end, it‚Äôs what made them who they are: interesting, resilient, criminal and ultimately dangerous. Heartbreakers that they are, I fell in love with all of them.A masterful storyteller and creative writer with a clever sense of humor, Bardugo is one of my favorite authors. As much as I adored The Grisha Trilogy, I absolutely love the dirty and gritty beauty of Six of Crows. And, I need to have the next book soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YXISXO77AN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627792120#wasThisHelpful","R23YXISXO77AN0","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Apparently this is Bissell‚Äôs first venture with a robotic vacuum and although I am generally pleased with it‚Äôs performance, their prototype still has a few bugs that need to be ironed out.When the vacuum first arrives, the large lithium battery needs to be wall-charged for up to five hours. When it has been thoroughly charged, then you can set up the docking station, which contains a digital clock and can be programmed with a schedule for time and the days that you want the robot to automatically start cleaning. This is where I had trouble. The instructions are mostly geared towards how to use a remote control to do this, but this vacuum does not come with the remote. It took me a few days to figure out how to program it but I finally got it.Resembling a large crab or maybe a gigantic bug, the Bissell creeps along the floor with two rotating side brushes that sweep debris towards the undercarriage brush, and then suctions it up into a small removable case that reminds me of a Tupperware sandwich box. This needs to be cleaned daily or the vacuum will stop moving when it is full. Initially I found the motor to be quite noisy but I have since grown used to it. One thing to note is that this vacuum is not meant for cleaning enormous dust balls or large amounts of dirt. If your house is like mine, it was a good idea to first clean the floors with a regular vacuum and then use the robot for daily upkeep.There is a battery-operated monitor you can place on the floor in any area that the robot is not allowed; it‚Äôs like an invisible fence. But there is only one monitor available. It has a ‚Äúcliff-sensing‚Äù device on the robot that will prevent it from falling down the stairs and that works rather well except for the time it went out my backdoor and attempted to escape down the back steps. I have since learned to shut the backdoor.The robot itself can be programmed for two suction powers. It has four different vacuum patterns to choose from or you can program all four if you want. When it comes up to furniture it bumps gently and then redirects it‚Äôs path. Amazingly, it appears to sense walls and will turn before bumping. One night my husband and I watched the robot moving along the floor avoiding walls but then it got stuck under a chair for about ten minutes. It was rather hilarious.Now, what I have trouble with concerning the robot: it likes to eat the fringes on our area rugs. It will suction up the fringe and then twirl around because it can‚Äôt let go. And phone charging cords are not safe. I find myself ‚Äúbabysitting‚Äù it so it doesn‚Äôt put the wrong things in its mouth, which defeats the purpose of a robot vacuum. Also, the robot is supposed to return to its docking station when the power becomes low. Mine has yet to find the station. I‚Äôve found it dead in the back bathroom, my bedroom, and the living room; everywhere but the docking station that is set up in the kitchen.Is it effective? Like I said, it does a better job at upkeep than thorough cleaning. Sometimes it appears selective in what it picks up and will leave larger bits of dust on the floor.Most important question that my kids had: Will the cat ride on it? Heck, no, the poor animal looked terrified and bolted out of the room.I give it a 3.5 because it eats parts of my rugs and can‚Äôt find the docking station. Perhaps Bissell‚Äôs next venture will iron out some of these bugs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25MZEX7H2LTIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C99PQ#wasThisHelpful","R25MZEX7H2LTIB","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A light and refreshing moisturizer based on the blend of minerals found in the Dead Sea desert and it's water, AHAVA gel cream feels so lovely on the skin. There is no tacky or greasy feeling after application as it absorbs quickly and the fragrance is very subtle.The box contains a printout of the minerals found in this moisturizer and where they came from. And apparantly the healing properties of the Dead Sea are famous. I did notice my skin did not experience any irritation or breakouts.

"While the topic of rape is painful and inspires feelings of anger, it is also complex; it is an important issue that should never be swept under the rug. Although our attitudes and social mores have changed over the last few hundred years, our progress is not yet complete. We have evolved from the era when a father decides who his submissive and dutiful daughter marries to ""No means no"". But, the issues of slut shaming and ""boys will be boys"" have not been eradicated and a woman in a short skirt is still ""asking for it"". It's infuriating to realize that, whether we know it or not, people are still taking sides.What We Saw is a novel that takes the idea for it's story from an incident that recently happened in a small town and puts it into context for the reader. The author gives the main players names. The setting is still a small town that supports it's high school sports teams and the accused are members of the state championship-bound basketball team. What the reader takes from this story is that because people, with all their flaws and fallibilities, are involved, the topic of rape is still not straightforward.Kate Weston wakes up the morning after a big party with a huge hangover. Her best friend, Ben, had driven her home early because she was too drunk. On Monday, she realizes a girl named Stacy is not in geology. People are talking about her. Then Kate sees a photo on the Internet of the half-dressed and apparently unconscious Stacy tossed over the shoulder of one of the star basketball players. Kate finds there are more pictures and supposedly a video that everyone is whispering about. When four of the star players are arrested for rape, Kate's school and the town practically explodes with anger. Fingers are pointed at Stacy because she had been drinking and she was known to sleep around. People are furious, even indignant, that this ""incident"" threatens their team's chance to go to State.As Kate's relationship with Ben blossoms into more than friendship she finds herself torn. Ben, an all-around good kid, wants to distance himself from the turmoil and focus on a scholarship to escape the suffocation of their small town. Kate wants to know what really happened. How can it be Stacy's fault if she was unconscious? Kate was just as drunk as Stacy; it could have happened to her. Would she too be to blame for her actions? As her friends and family take different sides from one another, Kate applies a principle she learned in geology: seismic shifts may be small and unnoticeable, but they are still earth shattering.I cannot say I loved this book; it's impossible to love a story about such an issue. I can say that I cared enough for the characters to feel their intense pain but also recognize why some of them felt the way they did. For good or bad, I understand the reasons why Ben wanted to steer clear of the fallout. But, I also applaud Kate for doing what she had to do despite her clear understanding of what the consequences would be. And that's what made this book so painful: the collateral damage is just as devastating as the rape. No one is spared.This is an important discussion and the author has done a commendable job in exploring society's attitudes towards women and the subject of rape. I highly recommend it for every teenager.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKFNXI8354ZK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062338749#wasThisHelpful","RKFNXI8354ZK8","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Silent Scream started out interesting enough with a murder, nothing too gruesome, but it draws you in because the victim recognizes her murderer. Then, the narrative moves on to introduce the reader to DI Kim Stone, a most irritating detective; she‚Äôs arrogant, rude, and damaged. She reacts to her gut feeling. She rides a Kawasaki. She grew up in the foster care system. If it weren‚Äôt for the fact that this character is an irredeemable bully, I would go so far as to her to say she reminds me exactly of DI Helen Grace of the MJ Arlidge series.This is one of the few books that I almost did not finish. Multiple times. After putting up with Stone‚Äôs negative disposition and her completely lackluster co-workers for a few chapters (Which one was Stace? Is Kev the one with the angry girlfriend?) I was ready to chuck the book. Especially if her partner DC Whathisname kept calling her ‚ÄúGuv‚Äù. I found the dialogue to be clich√© and trite. The ‚Äúparagraphs‚Äù barely had two sentences; the narrative was mostly a sentence at a time. It did make for faster skimming like I ended up doing.The only thing that kept me interested was the mystery. There‚Äôs a second murder. Then the skeleton of a young girl is found at an archeological dig next to a burned-down home for wayward teens. At that point I was able to overlook Stone‚Äôs behaviour and focus on the story, but then she would be a jerk to a co-worker or a witness or some total stranger and I would consider tossing the book‚Ä¶again. And the book is chock full of face-palm-plant moments to keep the reader entertained. My favorite was during Stone‚Äôs interview with the first victim‚Äôs co-worker; the victim is dead barely more than 12 hours and the co-worker is blatantly flirting with Stone? That is a WTH moment for sure. Also, whenever the police dug up another body, the murderer‚Äôs inner dialogue was practically drooling with nostalgic glee while he relived that victim‚Äôs last few moments.After Stone completely alienates half the characters in the book the author tries to build sympathy for her by placing blame on the death of her brother, her incarcerated and psychotic mother, and the years Stone spent as a nobody in the foster care system. The only outlet for her damaged heart is in rebuilding a motorcycle. She has a rare few moments when she shows a sense of humor. That‚Äôs all well and good, but Stone is still a jerk.When the killer is finally revealed, it‚Äôs a weird twist is a canyon-size stretch that might shock some readers but it‚Äôs nothing new or unusual. I really wanted this to be a good book and I did keep reading in case it got better. But it all comes down to the immature dialogue, one-dimensional and/or unmemorable characters, and a completely unlikeable main character. There are plenty of books out there with anti-heroines, but they at least have some quality about them that makes the reader actually appreciate or enjoy the person‚Äôs character. Case in point: DI Helen Grace.Judging from the hundreds of 5 star reviews I can see the author has some fans and I‚Äôm glad for the debut writer but I won‚Äôt be picking up her next book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZ65MUBANTTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5K0CAU#wasThisHelpful","R3OZ65MUBANTTV","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Strongly spiritual and beautifully written, Miserere is an emotionally fulfilling and phenomenally creative story. It is world building and character driving fantasy writing at it‚Äôs finest. Because it takes the tenants of our major world religions and uses them for the foundations of Miserere‚Äôs Woerld religions does not mean it is a Christian book. Nor does the fact one of the main characters is a young teen make it a YA novel. Miserere is intense and creative and the characters are fiercely compelling. And its debut author has produced a most memorable experience.This was such a joyful change from the usual fantasy novels on the market. The author has taken only a bare few of the usual tropes and poetically and spiritually blended them into a fantastical new world with memorable and soulful characters.  I cannot rave enough about this book.Please, read it.

"A drawback to modern urban fantasy novels is the author mistaking sarcasm with just plain smartass. In the first few pages of Pale Queen Rising we meet Claire, the top assassin for the Winter Queen, as she threatens and interrogates a victim. Her inner voice and snarky dialogue comes across as immature and, from an assassin point of view, completely unintimidating. Just those first few pages almost made me chuck the book into the DNF bin. But, I held on. It was a good move on my part.Despite the weak beginning and after starting on the wrong foot, the book improves exponentially. Either I grew accustomed to Claire, the main character, or the narrative improved. A mortal raised in the Winter Kingdom by Queen Mab, Claire is trying to discover who is syphoning off the ""Dream"" that fuels the citizens of Winter and the Summer kingdoms. A byproduct of happy mortal thoughts, Dream is equally and tentatively shared by the two, but the unknown third party is endangering their treaty.The world building is solid as the author already established it in his earlier trilogy, The Immortal Circus. The magic of the fae, the demons, the witches, and the mortals who learn from them is, well, magical. The beasts are fantastic. And I absolutely love the demon Eli. Claire, while not touchy-feely, is compelling. Between her anger, her sense of loss concerning her real mother, her compulsion for killing, and her love of good bourbon and a hot bath, I did grow to like her.While I have not read the trilogy that precedes this new series I understand it is not truly necessary. I quickly read some the synopses of those books to see if it would affect my experience. There are characters that dwell in both trilogies. And despite the cliffhanger ending of Pale Queen Rising that does stem from the Circus Trilogy, I do not feel compelled to read it. One thing I did notice is that in most of the reviews concerning the final book of The Immortal Circus the readers were angered by the ending. Some were furious. They felt too many questions were left unanswered. This must be the ""rest of the story"" the readers were begging for.So, despite the rocky beginning, I know I will continue this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V0CYOOG0CACD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VARL00Q#wasThisHelpful","R3V0CYOOG0CACD","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first time I used The Falsies mascara I noticed how thick it was. Usually I apply 2 coats and I did so with this product. The result is a very thickly coated, spidery set of lashes that I had to separate with a lash comb. The wand is loose and wiggly so it would brush against the bridge of my nose and leave a thick black smudge when I had to work on my left eye with my right hand. It was a bit much for what I usually wear to work.The second time I used the mascara I applied only 1 coat. The look is still rich and dramatic but not as spidery yet I still had to separate the lashes. The wand brush is shallow and doesn't evenly touch or separate the lashes and may be the reason the mascara is so thick when applied. Because the appearance is not very subtle, I would recommend this for an evening out or a party. It's too flamboyant for work.The price is affordable but the look is not for an everyday/office/work use.

"The first book of The Great Library series, Ink and Bone, establishes an alternative reality where a significant wonder of the ancient world, The Royal Library of Alexandria, was not destroyed and burned to the ground. The world did not lose the massive and invaluable collections of cultural writings. The library still exists in the year 2025 and is the center of political power. However, instead of encouraging the masses to engage in critical thinking or writing, the Library regulates what the people are allowed to read. Books are forbidden. New ideas are forbidden. There are no paper books, only a device called the Codex is available for approved books or any news updates. Hence, there is a booming black market in paper books. But anyone caught dealing or buying or owning unapproved material faces the death penalty.Ink and Bone follows the young Jess from his family roots in the black market to the great Library itself as a candidate for the honor of Library scholar. It's a ruthless process that thousands apply for, and whereas a handful might be accepted, in the end only six candidates will become scholars. This is a provocative idea that could make for a stimulating new YA series. But, despite a chase scene in the beginning, Ink and Bone starts out dry and kind of flavorless. While a few of the characters are interesting, none are that compelling to me. And, many of the details taken as fact in the story just don't make sense.How does a Library once built as a center of knowledge that encouraged new ideas and debate become an authoritarian political power that forbids such undertakings? That part is never explained. The Library hoards any ancient hand-written material and books so the people are forced to read only what is broadcasted on their government-controlled Codexes. Guttenberg's idea for a printing press was regarded as seditious and therefore did not become reality. So, what did people read in the centuries before the Internet Codexes? I can't wrap my head around that one.Also, since the greatest honor in society is to become a Library scholar the reader would expect grueling testing and classwork that establishes who become the final six. That is part of the program but what truly decides who gets to stay is a roll of the dice. That's right, their teacher rolls a pair of dice and the unlucky are sent home.  What????There are other parts that bugged me like hints that parts of the world are at war and the first time the reader learns this is when the English Jess meets a candidate from Wales. The tension between the two is vaguely explained by some comment that they are at war. Aaaaannnnddd...? Later there is more exposition but very little other than the English-Welsh war. And don't get me started on the automatons and the Translation Center; they appear to be plot devices tossed in as needed.It's not a terrible book, it has its interesting moments and towards the end it's pretty good, but it's flawed and I felt disengaged. So I won't be checking out the next book in the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUQ61BSVVRDZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4BQQ#wasThisHelpful","RUQ61BSVVRDZP","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"During the Civil War, Andersonville Prison in Confederate Georgia was notorious for it‚Äôs horrific and inhumane conditions. In a four-month period the prison population ballooned from just over 7,000 prisoners to an unbelievable 31,000 Union soldiers. Short on food rations, water, medicine and housing, prisoners died by the thousands of malnutrition and disease. Just the facts alone concerning Andersonville make for an unimaginable horror story. Author Edward Erdelac has taken these barbaric prison conditions and added his own angle: there is something darker and more arcane than just humans controlling Andersonville.While most prisoners would try to escape the prison camp, Barclay Lourdes, a black slave with a mysterious past, steals into Andersonville. Barclay originates from New Orleans but wears Yankee blue and some of the prisoners notice he is more educated than most black slaves. Many of the white prisoners cannot even read, but Barclay can. He is a man with a mission and it takes awhile for the reader to discover the true reason. While Barclay struggles to survive the white prejudice against slaves he must also deal with the suspicions that the other blacks feel towards him. There are some interesting, and bizarre, characters that add some good momentum to the plot.It‚Äôs a great idea for a story and Erdelac‚Äôs book is terrific. Just his descriptions of the inhumane conditions were horror enough for me but his dark arts twist makes the story even more so. The author incorporates actual events and people from the real Andersonville giving the book some historical flavor.There are times the book meanders or the flashbacks are confusing, but it all comes together in the end. Some of the writing comes across as unpolished, but the strength of the story significantly carries it. I highly enjoyed it and recommend it to horror book fans.No worries, the story is zombie and vampire-free.[This review is based on an advanced copy received from the publisher via NetGalley.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MRRYIDWYCMWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWDZZGK#wasThisHelpful","R3MRRYIDWYCMWV","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having never read any of Rae Carson's works before but knowing they were all high fantasy YA novels I had no idea what to expect from her latest book, Walk On Earth A Stranger. Set during the nineteenth century American gold rush period it could have read like historical fiction but for one element: the main character, Leah Westfall, is blessed with the ability to divine gold. Not just pan or mine the precious metal, Leah, also known as Lee, can sense even minute particles of gold hidden in the earth or streams. She is even overcome with her ""witchy"" feeling concerning gold when she is near jewelry or gilded objects. Her talent could make her family extraordinarily rich. But, her parents have always taught her, and lived by, a strong sense of morality and principle. They live simply. Any gold she finds on another person's property is not theirs. And, just like the bag of gold dust hidden under the kitchen floorboards, the Westfall family has kept Lee's talent a secret from everyone; even her best friend, Jefferson.Then one day, Lee's world is shattered and she is forced to flee. Only days earlier, Jefferson had asked Lee to run away from their home in Georgia to California with him. Scared but determined, Lee decides to her only choice is to escape her home and find Jefferson. But, back then, women couldn't, and didn't, travel alone; not only was their safety at stake, but women were regarded as the property of men. So, Lee cuts off her hair, dresses as a young boy and hits the trail west.At this point the book focuses on Lee's voyage and the unbelievable hardships the pioneers faced just to get to the other side of the continent. What now takes us only a few days drive time took the pioneers months to travel. And the daily blood, sweat and tears they experienced would result in a mere twelve to twenty miles of trail by nightfall. Hired by a wagon train made up of families, bachelors, and immigrants, Lee continues to hide her identity and her talent. But her story is more than the miles traveled; it is also made of many rites of passages for Lee. She turns out to be a very remarkable and courageous young woman with strong opinions concerning race and women's rights.Carson's story is compelling as her characters are likeable or understandable and the writing is strong. I felt for the characters when, whether for safety or practical reasons, they were forced to make some hard and very painful decisions while on the road. The descriptions of their days of hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and heat, or their moments of fear were palpable. I even cried while reading a few of the scenes. I also felt joy with the travelers when they would experience moments of music around the nightly campfire, friendship, or just find clean water. And I love how the author would symbolically sprinkle references to gold throughout the story: Lee's eyes, Jefferson's dog's name, buttons on a shirt, the color of a desert sunset. Even Lee's last name, Westfall, has meaning.It's an outstanding book and a great beginning for a trilogy. It will be interesting to see what the author has in store for these characters in the next book.Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKY78DH7D95YB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062242911#wasThisHelpful","RKY78DH7D95YB","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In author Christopher Farnsworth‚Äôs world, if a vampire can take a blood oath to protect the president of the United States, then, by God, the Fountain of Youth is not just a legend, it‚Äôs the premise for yet another entertaining book. The Eternal World, a standalone book, is a story of greed and revenge, altruism and love, and for good or bad, how the world could be forever changed by the fountain‚Äôs existence.Five hundred years ago, a young conquistador, wounded in battle, is running through the jungle of the New World. As he lies dying in a cave near a pool of blue water, he feels the cool touch of a beautiful angel. Abrupt fast-forward to present day: a serial killer is hunting his next prey and finds himself the victim. Then, Dr. David Robinton, a man who dedicates his life to his lab and his research, finds himself being dumped by his girlfriend. So when he receives an offer from playboy and pharmaceutical giant, Simon Oliver, to join his company with multiple perks and an unlimited budget to research an anti-aging drug, the driven David cannot refuse.But Simon Oliver is more than the womanizer and drunkard the paparazzi love to catch on film, he is a man with a very old secret and an ancient enemy. The beautiful Shako has been tracking Simon for many years and she is out for revenge. Her first scene in the book proves she is more than capable when it comes to dealing with murderous scum and it is possible she could easily destroy Simon‚Äôs world.While David is driven to perfect a compound that will cure the body-ravaging effects of disease and old age, it appears that Simon also wants to save the world. But is he truly a compassionate billionaire or is he just a greedy megalomaniac? It doesn‚Äôt take much to put two and two together in this book. There are a few twists that are pretty good. There are some flashbacks that fill in the blanks, including a rather large expository segment concerning Simon and Shako. Some people call it an ‚Äúinfo dump‚Äù, but, whatever, the book is still entertaining. However, the droll sense of humor that is found in the Nathaniel Cade series is sorely missing in The Eternal World. I miss that cantankerous old vampire.No matter how much the readers need to suspend their disbelief, they will find this book to be a fast-paced and exciting read. I know I‚Äôll recommend it to a few of my reading buddies. And, I know I‚Äôll read Farnsworth‚Äôs next novel, vampire or not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BM1G4VTLYVB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062282921#wasThisHelpful","R2BM1G4VTLYVB6","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This computer was my introduction to the searing pit of malaise known as Windows 8.I've used Windows 7 for the past six years. Windows 7 is a pretty decent operating system. Windows 8, as you probably know, is a seething horror-show of apps, blinking tiles, little slideshows, the phases of the moon, I mean WHAT IS THIS??? When I turn on my computer, I want to see my desktop. What I don't want to see are all these ""apps"" that I didn't install, stuff for managing my investment portfolio or reading the news and the weather and recipes and all these little pictures of people I don't know, pictures of food that I didn't make, just staring back at me. Taylor Swift's face should not appear, unbidden, on my laptop. It's that simple. It's like what you would expect to find at msn.com, only they've brought msn.com straight to my desktop. Noooooo!!!!I should mention that my previous laptop is also a Dell, specifically, the Studio XPS 16, which I got about six years ago. It's worked well over the years and with various upgrades (memory, HDD), it's been a good computer.Now, if you use any computer for six years, your fingers just automatically go where they need to go. And you might expect a slightly different keyboard layout on a different brand of computer. But it turns out Dell thinks that even existing Dell users should have to relearn the the locations of various keys. Like the ""home,"" ""end,"" ""delete,"" page up, and page down buttons. All in different places. WHY DO THEY DO THIS? It's like when you go to the grocery store you've been shopping at for years, and one day they've switched all the aisles around so the paper towels are where the cereal used to be and beer is where the paper towels used to be, and you have to wander the store for 20 minutes just to find a bottle of ketchup.And what's up with the function keys? I can't just hit F5 anymore to reload a web page. Now I have to press the Fn key while pressing F5. Otherwise I end up PAUSING THE MUSIC I WAS LISTENING TO. Good god, people, WHY WHY WHY???Oh, speaking of keys, the keyboard feels a little flimsy. Again, this is in comparison to my previous Dell laptop, which had a keyboard that felt solid when I typed. I guess I'm a pretty forceful typist, but I don't think it should feel like my fingers tapping away might actually break the keyboard, but that's how it feels sometimes. Like the plastic plate around the keys might snap into pieces just through normal typing.It didn't help that the keyboard plate was actually semi-detached from the body of the computer when I first opened it. It felt REALLY flimsy then as it rattled up and down with every keystroke, until I realized the problem and snapped two of the keyboard tabs back into the frame. Nice quality control, Dell.Another issue is with the touchpad. Sometimes I have to tap the thing like six times to get a click to register, and I promise you by the sixth time, a ""tap"" has become something rather more emphatic. Especially when you click a link and sit there waiting for it to load and then you realize the click didn't register and you've just been sitting there doing nothing. Maybe there are certain areas on the pad which don't register a regular ""left"" click. I don't know. There's no way to know. Maybe I'm just used to my previous Dell's touchpad. As it is, though, the touchpad is a dreadful combination of being much MORE sensitive to light movements (although this can be adjusted), and ultra-UNresponsive when it comes to taps (which as far as I can tell, cannot be adjusted).Initial setup seemed to take ages. I was particularly alarmed when the system prompted me to sign into my Microsoft account (or create one!) as part of the setup process. Good god, can you imagine? The wireless adaptor immediately found my WiFi, so that was nice. All the better for my computer to start sending my personal info back to the mothership, I suppose.As I learned six years ago, Dell computers come loaded with all kinds of bloatware, junkware, hellware and all-around yuckware, and this one is no exception. This, coupled with the bizarre array of ""apps"" that came pre-installed, immediately led me to undertake a clean install of Windows 8.1. This was pretty easy using the Windows Installation Media Creation Tool, which I downloaded from the Microsoft site and followed the instructions. Unfortunately, neither the wireless nor the wired ethernet network adaptors were functioning afterward, which meant there was no way to get online, which meant no way for the computer to download drivers so as to fix itself, in an infinite loop of loathing. I tried reinstalling again with the same results.So that was that. I then decided to install Ubuntu. Which was extremely easy to do and I was sailing along just fine thinking to myself ""HAHA Windows 8.1, you lose!"" Until that night when I wanted to watch ""Sons of Anarchy"" on Netflix. Whereupon I found that there is no way in Ubuntu to adjust screen contrast. Brightness yes, contrast no. Which meant that all video was either too dark, or completely washed out. So it was back to Windows 8.1 again.A quick aside here: WHAT WAS SO WRONG WITH WINDOWS 7 THAT YOU HAD TO GO AND CHANGE IT???By the way, if you do reinstall Windows, you'll notice that nowhere on the computer will you find the license key. Used to be they'd put it on a sticker on the bottom of the laptop. Invariably upside-down, so that instead of simply tilting the laptop up away from you and looking at the sticker underneath, you had to pick the whole thing up and hold it upside down.Well now the sticker doesn't exist, because the license key is hard-coded into the bios chip (in encrypted form), so you don't ever have to enter this license key again. The bios automatically knows that your Windows installation is valid because it's physically paired with your specific machine. So there you go.(If you do reinstall windows, be sure to save the Firefox installer onto a USB drive first so that you don't have to open Internet Explorer even once to get online. Not even to download Firefox.)Well this time, the wireless adaptor STILL didn't work, but miraculously, the wired ethernet adaptor DID work, so all I had to do was plug it directly into my cable modem and let Windows download the correct drivers, and before long I was connected to WiFi and ready to go.Now, there is a way to disable the hellish Windows 8 ""app screen"" so that you go straight to the desktop by default, but I'm too exhausted to describe how to do it. You can Google it, though. It was pretty easy. You'll of course have to manually delete certain of the more hideous apps, like Internet Explorer (just no), and Mail (hello, gmail.com), and Microsoft's vile media player and completely unnecessary pdf reader and bunch of other silly absurd stuff. But with a little bit of time and effort you can get things more or less under control.I don't know, guys. It's a nice computer. The fan is pretty quiet, and it stays pretty cool, so it doesn't scorch my lap and turn my wrists into a pair of braised sausages like my old Dell did. Battery life seems pretty good. The built-in Bluetooth is nice. The screen is nice and wide.Oh, and guess what? They're currently rolling out Windows 10 (free upgrade), which means I probably get to do all this over again in a few weeks. Which I fully intend to do, because there's no way it could be worse than Windows 8. #famouslastwords","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10YKEJW51SPFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQXZW0Q#wasThisHelpful","R10YKEJW51SPFA","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the perfect skirt for work or just kicking around on the weekend. At 5'4"" and 115 pounds, the small size fits me perfectly. The hem sits about an inch or two above my knees but the elastic waistband can be folded over to make for a shorter skirt if desired.I love the diagonally curved scallop seams; it is not only an eye-pleasing detail, it gives the cotton/spandex fabric more flexibility and movement. So far I have worn the skirt while gardening, doing housework, and at a barbecue; it's that versatile.The price is fair for the value of what you receive.

"The beginning of this novel sets the tone perfectly: as a man is confessing to a brutal rape and murder of a young women he is envisioning himself attacking the female detective sitting in front of him. What the reader quickly learns is that the man is a famous crime fiction writer with early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs and the murder is a scene from his first novel. Only fifty years old, Jerry Gray, writing under the name Henry Cutter, is rapidly deteriorating, losing his memory, and his life, to the insidious disease he calls ‚ÄúCaptain A‚Äù. But, while Jerry‚Äôs family and friends refuse to believe his confused ramblings, the reader sees reason to believe that what he is saying is quite possibly true.This creates an unusual conundrum, and a fantastic plot device, that will constantly keep the reader on its toes. Is Jerry telling the truth or did his life as a fictional storyteller, a ‚Äúmake up artist‚Äù, leave him to believe he actually did commit those crimes? As he always told aspiring writers, ‚Äúwrite what you know‚Äù. Did the actions of Jerry Gray make him the popular writer Henry Cutter because he not only wrote what he knew; he wrote what he did?While the narrative is told in a third person present tense, there are expository chapters in the form of Jerry‚Äôs journal; a first person past tense detailing his descent into ‚ÄúBat**** County‚Äù.  He refuses to call it a diary, it is a journal and it is for the future Jerry so when reaches that point of no return he will have a chronicle to remind him how he got there and what he lost along the way. It‚Äôs pretty powerful and the events he writes about are incredibly sad. But, as the present day story unfolds, Jerry‚Äôs life becomes more harrowing because he keeps escaping from his nursing home. And when he is finally found many miles away and with no memory of what took place, the police are finding the bodies of murdered women.The pacing is fast and the twists build up, especially as the book comes to a close. There are some reveals that sharp readers might guess, or suspect, before the end. Otherwise it is a well-written and deeply disturbing book; fortunately there are moments of subtle dark humor to alleviate the shocks. I was glued to the pages and finished it in a day because I wanted to know how it ended.The good news: the author has a treasure trove of other mystery novels that I am definitely going to have to read now.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UVKT1PU6VOC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476779171#wasThisHelpful","R2UVKT1PU6VOC4","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start by saying this book is awesome. I love the premise, love the female main character, and because the backstory of Wolf by Wolf includes an intercontinental motorcycle race, it truly speeds along to the end. As a YA alternative history novel with a sci-fi departure from reality, it asks the reader to suspend their disbelief, and trust me, the way the author presents it, it's not hard to do.In the Author's Note she tries to examine the ""What if?"" facet of life with this book. What if Hitler and Emperor Hirohito had won the war? What if those two dictators took over the Eurasian continent and northern Africa? And what if the egregious medical experiments performed in the concentration camps left a young girl with the power to ""skinshift"" and change her appearance at will? That is the basis of Wolf by Wolf.After Yael, a young Jewish survivor of the medical experiments escapes a death camp she joins the resistance. Years later, her ability to skinshift gives the resistance a perfect opportunity to bring down the Nazi Regime. She must impersonate Adele Wolfe, the only female to win the annual Axis Tour, a grueling motorcycle race from Berlin to Tokyo, in the upcoming competition. Hitler will be in Tokyo for the finish and last year he honored Adele Wolfe during the Emperor's Ball. If she wins this race, Yael will have a chance to be close enough to Hitler to change history.Most of the book centers on the race with flashbacks to Yael's childhood and her years with the Resistance. The reader learns the personal meaning behind the five wolf tattoos on her arm. She is an intense, focused young woman with one goal: revenge. She is able to think on her feet, can handle any gun, carries a knife in her boot and is a trained fighter. Her skinshifting is a powerful tool. To sum up, the girl is badass.The race is not as straightforward as Yael assumed. Many of the racers play dirty and a huge monkey wrench is tossed into the story when two of the racers are close to the real Adele Wolfe. There is a lot of tension and some huge twists in the story. During the heart pounding racing scenes I actually felt myself grow tenser as the racers sped closer to the finish line. Every setback, every close call is nerve-racking. But despite moments of self-doubt, Yael's determination is unfailing and she is a fighter, a most powerful character.The author's writing style is expressive especially when conveying Yael's inner thoughts. The wolf tattoos have significant meaning to Yael and she counts them, wolf by wolf, in her moments of despair, when she needs reason to continue her mission. So many elements of this story are wonderful choices: using a victim of Nazi medical experimentation as a weapon against the Nazi's is my favorite. The end of the book could almost, but not quite, make it a standalone with some unanswered questions for the reader to draw their own conclusion. But, no, this is the first of two books and I am thrilled to say that I will pre-order the next one as soon as I can and will breathlessly wait for it.Highly recommended. Highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NASEV0X7A8PE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316405124#wasThisHelpful","R2NASEV0X7A8PE","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When a trio of pirates ambushes a yacht in the South China Sea they discover the cargo is more than the fortune in sapphires they were hired to steal. There is an incredible find on that yacht, something worth killing for. Only one man returns to shore and texts the ‚Äújugmaker‚Äù, his employer Angela, that he has the stones but doesn‚Äôt tell her what else was on the boat. Then he disappears. Angela receives a deadly threat: Return what you stole and I will return the sapphires. With her back against the wall, Angela contacts someone she hasn‚Äôt seen for five years, someone who thought she was dead: Jack, a criminal with extraordinary skills, a Ghostman. And Angela, his mentor, taught him everything he knows.To tell any more of the book would ruin all the surprises and twists that make it an entertaining and exciting read. The author is obviously having a great time with his characters and the setting, the island of Macau. After hearing the author, Roger Hobbs, speaks the other night about the second book in his Ghostman series it was apparent that he loves what he does and intends to keep writing. He has the basics of the third book lined up and is very excited. His exuberance comes across in Vanishing Games.The relationship between Jack and Angela goes way back and they have what appears to be more than just a non-romantic student/teacher connection. It‚Äôs an interesting collaborative partnership and I think the author does a good job of keeping it genuine. Unlike the first book, Ghostman, which had a team working together on a job, Vanishing Games is just the two of them. And it works well.But what really amused me about this book is that is almost reads like a textbook on how to be a master criminal. The reader will learn the best way to scuttle a boat, destroy the facial features of a severed head, make a silencer out of a plastic pop bottle, the workings of a ‚ÄúKansas City Shuffle‚Äù, and how to break into a hotel room using a program off the internet to bypass the card key system. And that is only naming a few of the tricks someone can learn from this book.It‚Äôs a fun read with a fast and furious ending. This book does not disappoint. Recommended for those who love thrillers or want to pick up some extra tips on how to become a Ghostman.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PPE02QME3LJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKO3TJS#wasThisHelpful","R1PPE02QME3LJS","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many authors will borrow a few ideas or elements from other books and tell their tale with a different flair or meaning or perspective. Others will sometimes borrow too heavily and while they may try to make the story their own, it does not work and the reader is constantly comparing one book to the other.That's how I felt when I read author Melissa Gray's debut YA fantasy novel, The Girl at Midnight. Too much of Gray's book is directly borrowed from Laini Taylor's awesome and beautifully written novel, Daughter of Smoke and Bone. I'm willing to overlook similarities and enjoy another author's different take on a story, but I was so distracted by the unequivocal likenesses of the two books that it detracted from the reading experience. And, Gray doesn't have the writing chops that Taylor has.The first chapter was a great beginning. A Seer, The Ala, from the ancient race of bird-like Avicen people adopts a young human runaway. While the Avicen live underground in present time New York, the little runaway, unfortunately named Echo, lives in the New York public library where she reads constantly. The Avicen have begrudgingly allowed Echo into their world and she grows into a sassy, sometimes annoyingly too sarcastic, teenager who is an expert at pickpocketing and stealing. She's tight friends with Ivy and has just started a romance with Rowan, both Avicen.Then the author introduces the Drakharin people, centuries-old enemies of the Avicen. Unlike the Avicen who sport feather-like hair, the Drakharin have dragon scales. Why they hate each other is never covered in this first book of the trilogy but their Dragon Prince, Caius, is tired of the war. He wants peace as he mourns the death of his secret Avicen lover. His one-dimensionally evil twin sister craves war and victims for her to personally torture.Separately, both Caius and the The Ala believe peace can be attained if the ancient, and mythical, firebird is found. It's power can end the war. The Ala sends, of all people, Echo to find it. Meanwhile, Caius and his best friend, Dorian, are on their own quest for the firebird. Of course they will cross paths. If you have read Daughter of Smoke and Bone, you will, by this time, recognize the similarities: Avicen=Chimaera, Drakharin=Angels. They are at war, they hate each other, they should never intermix, but sometimes souls will fall in love with the wrong kind.The relationship between Caius and Echo is predictable and uneventful. Of course it includes a love triangle. But, it is the relationship between Dorian and another Avicen that really captures the spirit of how people so diverse can fall for one another: it is tentative and shy and awkward and...normal. I fell in love with those two.Now, the ending: a feeble Deus ex Machina comes swooping in to save the day, of course. But, what it is and how it is discovered made me laugh out loud and shake my head. Really? Really?I really wanted to like this book. And I really wish I could give this debut author a big thumbs up but there were too many similarities to DOSAB. Echo could be unbelievably annoying. And the ending was...really?Anyway, I'm sure Gray will develop a fan base and grow as a writer, but her debut novel just didn't grab me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31B7JG1B8UA7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038574465X#wasThisHelpful","R31B7JG1B8UA7C","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Perky-Pet wild bird feeder, with it's sturdy construction, squirrel baffle and four compartment seed dividers, should be the best feeder I've ever owned. And at $70+ a pop, it had better be the best bird feeder in my backyard. So, what's the problem?The birds completely ignore it.I have five feeding stations in my yard and two weeks after hanging the Perky-Pet I noticed it was still full.  I let the other feeders go empty so that the birds would try out the Perky Pet. Usually my yard is so populated with birds it sounds like walking into an aviary; constant bird chatter and songs. Now, it was empty. There was the lone finch that tried the thistle from the Perky-Pet every now and then but the birds were feeding elsewhere and my yard was silent.So, I re-hung my $10 cylinder feeders and my $35 Squirrel Buster feeders and the birds came back. They still ignore the Perky Pet.I don't know what the problem is but the feeder is built to last, it holds up to five pounds of seed, and can serve up to 10 birds at a time. So, I hate to give it a low rating but the birds' opinion does count. If they don't like it or use it, it is not a good feeder for my yard. Perhaps it will do well with other yards but, in mine, the birds have spoken.3 stars for construction. One star for effectiveness.Addendum: I was comparing my bird feeders to the Perky Pet and noticed the Perky Pet feeder holes are much smaller. That would explain why only a finch might show interest. The other birds' heads are too large. So, I changed my rating to 2 stars.Addendum as of May 10, 2015: I don't know what happened but some more birds are starting to take notice of the Perky-Pet. It's not just the finches either. So, I raised my rating to a 3 star because the product shouldn't be rated low because my birds were acting snobby.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DOXC54OWFVB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK3CUCS#wasThisHelpful","R2DOXC54OWFVB7","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eleven years ago, after reading a review in our local paper, I picked up a novel by then-debut author Craig Johnson called The Cold Dish. And I was hooked. His characters were vivid and human and likeable. The humor was cheeky, yet cleverly worded. There were elements of Indian mysticism and Greek philosophy. With the Wyoming terrain playing a volatile supporting character to the fallible human cast, The Cold Dish was one of the best books I had ever read from a debut author. Still is.Now ten books, 1 novella, and a collection of short stories neatly tucked under his cowboy belt, Johnson proudly, and rightly so, presents Dry Bones. With Sheriff Walt Longmire, the renaissance man of Wyoming lawmen, at the helm and his deliciously salty undersheriff Victoria ""Vic"" Moretti as his wingman, the fictitious Absaroka County is faced with a mystery that kind of began 65 million years ago. When the bones of probably largest and most intact T. Rex skeleton is discovered on Danny Lone Elk's ranch it is cause for celebration. Until, that is, the body of Danny Lone Elk is discovered face down in a pond of carnivorous snapping turtles. The imagery is not lost on the reader as Lone Elk's family, the Cheyenne tribe, the High Plains Dinosaur Museum, and the federal government all lay a claim to the dinosaur nicknamed ""Jen"".Walt's tiny town of 2483 citizens is immediately overrun with bureaucrats, media, and the FBI--that's the government agency FBI, not the Longmire sobriquet for big Indians. Henry Standing Bear, the sage Indian who has had Walt's back since elementary school, helps Walt navigate through the politically and culturally delicate dance with the Cheyenne tribe. Characters from past books like Agent In Charge McGroder, a man who owes Walt his life, and two agents, nicknamed the Bobs, assist with the federal investigation. Making Walt's job even more difficult is the supremely pompous acting deputy attorney, Skip Trost. And, on top of all of this mayhem, Walt's daughter is flying in from Philadelphia with his first grandchild, Lola, whose namesake is Henry's Baltic-blue 1959 Thunderbird convertible.Thankfully, now that deputies Saizarbitoria and the appropriately named Double Tough are back, as is former-Sheriff Lucian Connelly who stubbornly refuses to die, Walt has his entire team on board. Even Dog, his ever present canine sounding board is there to help. Saizarbitoria is able to update Walt on the multiple equipment requirements of an infant granddaughter. Lucian is willing to shoot anyone, anyone, just give him a chance. And Double Tough (I missed that guy), after losing his eye in an earlier book is back from medical leave sporting an eye patch and a fake eye. I laughed out loud at Vic's reaction when no one had the nerve to tell DT his new eye was the wrong color: ""I can't believe you a******* were going to let him wander around looking like a ****ed-up husky because you two were afraid of hurting his delicate feelings..."" I love that woman.But then tragedy hits Walt and it's a heartbreaker. And while Walt feels that it is personally aimed at him from someone in his past he has to deal with the human fallout and that's just not something he is good at. He's a man who keeps his feelings to himself and bumbles when handling the feelings of others. Boy howdy does this poor man seriously fumble around. It painfully reminds the reader that despite his strong and stoic nature, deep down, Walt is still a frail human. We also get to see a bit of Walt's childhood, something he rarely looks back upon. To add to Walt's unhappy distress, the prophetic visions of his ghosts are starting to come true.With his ability to build a strong story, his intelligent and clever word play, that cheeky sense of humor, and the most remarkable and endearing cast of characters; Johnson remains one of my favorite writers. I look forward to, and faithfully pre-order, all his new books. And, if he ever visits your town for a book signing, do go meet him. He is a most personable and accommodating speaker; he truly loves talking to his readers. His signings here started in a tiny little bookstore and as his audience grew exponentially he had to move to a larger venue.Yep, this book is highly highly highly highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DGE1DIZSIXKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426930#wasThisHelpful","R1DGE1DIZSIXKO","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Confession time: I bought the Faceless Knight for myself. I have been building one of those ubiquitous 3-D fairyland dioramas that you find on Pinterest in my backyard. I already have a couple of knights with horses (originally presents for my nephew but I kept them) and my son gave me a dragon for Christmas.They all look awesome in their mossy rock and succulent plant environment. The dragon is terrifying in his former-birdhouse-now-prison lockup. They just needed a Faceless Knight to add another mystical element to the story. Because the Faceless Knight reminded me of a the Ring Wraith from the movie, ""Lord of the Rings"", I had to order him.In the picture, it appears the knight is in a defensive stance. I didn't realize he is meant to be astride a horse. No matter, I'll just order an equally freaky horse for him, but for now he stands astride the mossy hilltop next to the dragon cage.

"The Marvel Avengers Crunch Beach Towel is colorful, large, and whimsically decorated with muscled good guys, but the fabric is about as thin as a tissue. While it is advertised as a beach towel that can also be used as a bath towel, do not be fooled by this double agent. It's about as absorbant as a cloth napkin. For $22 most buyers would expect a little more absorbency in a towel but I fear most of the profit goes towards the Marvel trademark and upkeep for Stan Lee's mustache.But you know, the kids don't care. It's got the Hulk and Iron Man! Unless the fabric is burlap and scratchy they don't notice, or care about, it's quality. It's the Avengers, for heaven's sake! Even I was running around wearing it like Thor's cape.Despite the price and fabric quality, it's perfect for laying around on the beach or the poolside, showing off to your playmates, LARP, ComiCon, superhero accessorizing, or just hanging in the bathroom so your adult friends can say, ""Oh my God, where did you get such a cool towel?""4 stars.

"Ruins of War by debut author John A. Connell is, I always hate saying this, a book that I really wanted to like. Setting the story post-WWII war-torn Germany with former enemy American army detectives investigating a series of gruesome murders sounded riveting. It's a brilliant idea for a detective series. But, in the end, the execution, dialogue, and some of the painfully one-dimensional characters sabotage what could be an impressive debut.Barely seven months after Germany surrendered, the country is in chaos. Neighborhoods are destroyed, families separated, children orphaned and the threat of a long, cold, and hungry winter has descended upon the once proud country. To make matters worse, the presence of the American army antagonizes a major part of the population. There is no mutual trust or respect. Criminal Investigator Mason Collins, an American police officer with a less than stellar reputation, is the lead detective in a gruesome killing. A body was found wired to a pole, it's abdomen flayed open, the arms and legs missing. What complicates this murder is the possibility the victim was German and the bureaucrats running the Criminal Investigation Division feel the Germans should handle this case. They are unwilling to supply the necessary time and manpower for a German ""problem"".Mason Collins feels differently, especially after a second body is discovered in the same condition. This becomes a point of contention between Collins and his unbelievably one-dimensional commanding officer. No matter how much progress or effort Collins makes in the case, the CO inevitably tells Collins it's not enough. His negative responses are inevitable and predictable. It gets old real fast. And I was stunned by his reaction near the end of the book when the killer kidnaps yet another victim. It's a race against time and he chooses to send his men on a different raid?When Collins meets an American journalist, Laura, their mutual attraction to one another would be an entertaining diversion from the horror that pervades the story if it weren't for one thing: their flirty banter is laughable. And not in a good way. The dialogue in the book is not the best but it really flattens when these two converse. It reminded me of an old B-movie. In fact, the whole book reads like a movie script and when I found out that the author is in the movie business I wasn't surprised.The serial killer has left mutilated bodies throughout Munich in bizarre displays that reminded me of the TV series ""Hannibal"" and the reader finds out he is a creature filled with self-loathing and anger. His cruelty is appalling but I laughed out loud when he reminded himself what he does for a living. The reader will figure out who he is and what drives him to do such barbaric acts rather early on in the book.The author's strongest writing comes from his commentary concerning post-war Germany. It's powerful and paints a vivid picture that leaves the reader sympathetic towards the citizens of the former Nazi regime. The hostility between the two former enemy countries is palpable, and understandable, from both sides. There are some good suspenseful scenes but if the story had been written more tightly the twists would have been more shocking and less predictable. And the author missed a perfect opportunity to better hide the killer's identity from the reader. He was on the right track.This is the first book in the Mason Collins detective series but I don't think I will continue to follow it. There is some strong writing in parts of this book, but it didn't satisfy me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XK8F5H0UCIKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425278956#wasThisHelpful","R1XK8F5H0UCIKB","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hands down, this is the worst and most expensive mop I have ever owned.I was so excited to receive it in the mail. It was easy to put together, the instructions concerning it's use were simple and easy to follow, and it even came with it's own special cleaner. It's sleek and light and the cord is extra long.Then, I plugged it in...the noise it made was almost louder than my neighbor's Harley. The scrubbing wheels are vacuum-powered as opposed to motorized which would make them stronger and more effective but I was too enamoured to care. But then the wheels got stuck multiple times and I had to either turn the machine on and then off for them to restart, or I had to reach down and use my hands to get them moving again. Touching the wet and dirty wheels was gross and my infatuation with my new mop began to wane.You need to squeeze a lever on the handle to get the cleaning water to squirt out onto the floor. Then you start mopping. The wheels do not distribute the water evenly so you have to make multiple back and forth motions, squeezing all the while so as to distribute the cleaning water. If there is a spill or some dirt on the floor you need to hold the cleaner on top of it while the wheels scrub at it. Repeat the motion if it doesn't work the first time. Usually you will need to repeat it again and again. Like a mop, only louder.After you have dowsed the floor, you kick a toe switch to vacuum up the water. Repeat again and again because the vacuum may be effective at vacuuming up dust but it does diddley when it comes to water. Then, when the darn thing stops working because there is some unbeknownst filter that clogs after using. Then you take the stupid thing apart while dumping dirty water all over the place. After much swearing and washing of the filter you can repeat your back and forth motions...like a mop. Except then the handle disconnects from the body of the vacuum (3 times!) leaving you to use even more salty language than previously.To be fair, I tried this thing twice on ceramic tile and hardwood floors just to make sure it was not user error that made this the most expensive and crappiest mop I have ever owned. When I turned the beast off the sound of silence is almost deafening. My hand was tired from squeezing the lever to distribute water, I was exhausted, and my arm and shoulder joints hated me for pushing the thing back and forth and back and forth ad nauseum. Like a mop but heavier, louder and less effective. And it took me triple the amount of time to clean than when I used a simple, timeless mop.Why anyone would pay $240 for this POC when they can buy a mop for under $10 is beyond me. This thing is going straight to the junk closet in my house where it can collect dust. Millennia from now when anthropologists dig it out, they too will be baffled by it's uselessness and will ask the same question: why would anyone buy this thing?","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NX5H3OKE35TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFMXWHW#wasThisHelpful","R3NX5H3OKE35TV","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When we think of angels, we think of beautiful and heavenly creatures created by God. We hear the beautiful music we know they make while they fly about with their gossamer wings. They are inspirational, divine, and a gift from Heaven.But, what if they weren't. What if they came down from Heaven and conquered the human race, turned them into slaves, destroyed their way of life? Those aren't creatures of God, those are the angels in Susan Ee's new book, World After, the second part of her Angelfall Trilogy. While they remain gorgeous winged creatures of power, their intentions are evil. And their actions are despicable.The second book picks up immediately after the end of the first. After the scorpion angels attacked Penryn, Raffe thought she had died and flew away with his transplanted demon wings, leaving her and his sword behind. However, the venom only temporarily injured Penryn and when she comes to life people view her as the living dead. It doesn't help that her mother is clinically mad and her sister is horribly disfigured by the angels' experiments. They escape with the resistance army that has effectively pissed off the angels by blowing up their aerie.Even though Raffe is not physically present during the first half of this book, the author has used a clever writing device to keep him in the story...and Penryn's thoughts. No question that the girl is in love with the angel she saved. She misses the gorgeous angel with what she describes as a ""corny sense of humor"". But, what are Raffe's feelings towards her? She's kickasss tough, has some mad karate moves and is deadly with Raffe's sword. What's the problem? Well, it's complicated.While Raffe is gone, Penryn is able to focus more on her mom and sister, Paige. Mom may be crazy, but there are times she is crazy like a fox. Paige is a sad story. Her body is a horror show, disfigured with Frankenstein-like stitching, her teeth filed to deadly points, Paige is revolting to the other humans. But, like their mom, she also has some tricks up her sleeve and I found myself gob-smacked by her by the end of the book. I like this family.  No, I love this family.Now, I'm still having some WTH moments with the angels' choice of party wear. Zoot suits? Flapper dresses? Is there some hidden meaning that I am not catching? But, the moment passes and I am still enchanted by the whole story.Then the book gets dark. Really, really dark. Just when you thought the angels could not be crueler or more sadistic, they prove you wrong. They crank it up to 11 on the evil meter. There are some insanely cringe-worthy moments in this book. And it's not only the angels that make you recoil in disgust. When beaten and starved and caged, the humans are pushed to their limits of their humanity.I have already pre-ordered the next book.Addendum: I read this while I was supposed to be studying for my test tomorrow. It's that good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R85FJGZ6786H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBE1P2Y#wasThisHelpful","R85FJGZ6786H1","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading Joe Abercrombie's first YA novel, Half a King, a strong beginning to his ""Shattered Seas"" trilogy, I recognized a writer who not only appreciates but revels in the virtue of a flawed character. My impressions were substantiated when I read his ""First Law"" trilogy. Abercrombie can bring to life characters that are insufferable and deceitful and should be unlikeable but, strangely enough, the reader devours them.He can also write mean fight scene.In his first journey into YA, Abercrombie introduced us to the world of the Shattered Seas and it's contentious countries ruled by the cruel High King. The young Yarvi, a political victim of palace subterfuge within his own country of Gettland is forced to take a journey as prince-turned-king-turned-slave-turned-hero. It is an odyssey of self-discovery that ends with his rightful position as Father Yarvi, right hand and Minister to the new king of Gettland.Half the World takes place shortly after the end of that superb first novel. While Father Yarvi is still a driving force to the story, this book mostly focuses on Brand and Thorn, two teenagers training to be warriors in the King's army. A horrific accident during a training exercise lands Thorn in prison; her death sentence, if carried out, is equally horrific. When Brand speaks up for her, he unwittingly changes their lives and launches their own odyssey.Father Yarvi must travel half the world looking for allies to fight against the High King. His crew includes Brand and Thorn, as well as his former shipmate Rulf from Half a King. The journey is brutal but it bonds the shipmates like a family, and is full of surprises. Thorn trains daily as a fighter with the cunning, foul-smelling, unpredictable, and completely entertaining Skifr, a highly skilled warrior herself who is not afraid to pick her nose in public. During their year of travel, Brand, a boy from the slums who dreamed of becoming a warrior quickly grows into a young man who prefers the way of Mother Peace and chooses to see the light in everything. Thorn, however, becomes a strutting fighter, a daughter of Father War, who revels in the battle. And Yarvi, constantly referred to as a man of ""deep-cunning"", who is bound to forsake the ways of Father War and must follow the ways of Mother Peace is definitely a bastard son of both. His strategies from the beginning to the end show a man of deep cunning who will sacrifice others to achieve his goals.As Half a King was recognizable as a YA novel with it's short chapters and shorter story, Abercrombie-Light to be sure, Half the World is more evolved and complex. While Thorn was angry and cocky, almost repelling at times, she had moments that defined her as more than just a fighter. She is also pretty good at spitting and hucking snot rockets. Brand may have seemed rather Mary-Sue-ish to some, but his loyalty to friends and family, and his unwavering integrity, especially in the end, made him a true warrior in my eyes. And, unlike the first book, I was able to recognize that this medieval world is definitely a futuristic remnant of what was once a world ruled by ""elves"" with their ""magic"" lights and tall buildings and factories.Abercrombie's books are some of the grittiest, and smelliest, fantasy novels but he thankfully also maintains a sense of humor throughout that helps alleviate what would otherwise be a bleak story. While he can write some of the best fight scenes, he is also able to expose the absolute horror of war: bloody and unfair and cruel and sickening. His major characters are never black and white, many are quite prickly, but they are enjoyable and memorable.I cannot wait for the next book.Highly recommended for fantasy nuts, YA enthusiasts, and Joe Abercrombie disciples.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XJGVUIAVO9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178429#wasThisHelpful","R23XJGVUIAVO9J","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently had the privilege of hearing fantasy writer Brandon Sanderson speak and he said if you take a deck of cards, fifty two elements we all know and recognize, and shuffle it you will always come up with a new creation. Always. No matter the combination of face cards, numbers and suits, you will have created something entirely new. Bearing that in mind, when I started reading Red Queen by debut author Victoria Aveyard I recognized elements of Divergent, Hunger Games, Graceling, even a dash of Harry Potter but it was still, to me, a new creation that I thoroughly enjoyed.In a fantastical world where humans are divided not by the color of their skin but by the color of their blood, those with Red blood are considered the commoners and workers and soldiers who live to serve the Silver-blooded elite. The Silvers are each blessed with a specific superhuman ability: telekinesis, speed, fire making, water nymph, mindreading, or strength, just to name a few. In this dystopian world, in the country of Norta, at war with Lakeland for the past century, the red-blooded Mare lives in the impoverished rural city of The Stilts where electricity is rationed and her only future is conscription into the army. When Mare's childhood friend, Kilhorn, loses his apprenticeship and must join the army, Mare takes drastic steps to save him.Her desperation fortuitously lands her in the palace as a servant,  herself safe from conscription. However, an extraordinary turn of events exposes an unknown power in Mare. The palace nobility quickly covers up the possibility that a Red could have the power of a Silver and Mare is betrothed to the king's second son. She is then forced to live a life of lies and political subterfuge. As her palace teacher explains to her ""Anyone can betray anyone"". Complicating her already imperiled life is the growing Red rebellion that threatens the Silvers' elite status and her ever-changing feelings towards not one, but both the king's sons.So, all the elements are familiar, easily recognizable and present but they do not detract from the pleasure of reading Red Queen. Yes, there are inconsistencies that have made other readers firmly plant their face in their palms. There are times I forget their world is advanced enough for video cameras and nuclear radiation when the palace women wear long silk gowns. The Silvers have their powers but will resort to using guns to fight the Reds. The Reds have been sent to the frontlines to fight the Lakelanders in the trenches for decades when it seems the war could be easily finished if the Silvers stepped in and used their powers.The story, while not fresh, is still interesting and the characters quite likable. The writing is not dumbed down or condescending. And there are enough twists to keep the reader on their toes. Some I was able to guess, others did surprise me. And the final battle scene is plausibly well written with enough tension to keep me up last night.  When the story ends, there is no huge cliffhanger to annoy the reader so the components will compel the reader to want to read the second novel.So, enjoy this deck of cards because the Red Queen has not been played yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JTYI85I6XRZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062310631#wasThisHelpful","R2JTYI85I6XRZ2","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I have never read anything by Richard Price, AKA Harry Brandt for this book, his reputation certainly precedes him and this latest novel, The Whites, has definitely made me a fan wanting to read more of his work. Although this police procedural could be a quick read for the story alone, I took my time enjoying his writing style, the essence of his characters, and his way of building a plot brick by captivating brick. It is one of the best books of this genre I have read in a long time.In the 90's, Billy Graves and a tight crew of young cops new to the Anti-Crime unit, self-christened themselves the Wild Geese. They were neighborhood regulars who tolerated the non-violents but gave hard chase, even over rooftops, to their ""prey"". Each earned their Gold Shield but over the years all the WG have since retired, except Billy. Some moved on to jobs vastly different from their rough riding days: one now the owner of a funeral home, another a superintendent for rundown apartment buildings, one even became a multimillionaire through hard work and good investments. Billy, however, due to the fallout of a tragic shooting, has remained on the dead end night shift.Through the years, each of the WG has born the burden of what they called a White: a heinous murderer that walked free. Each of the WG has kept in contact with the remaining loved ones, swearing that one day their White would be convicted. Then, one night Billy recognizes a murder victim as one the Whites. Not shedding tears, he notifies the WG. Then, another White shows up dead. While this should be cause for celebration, Billy starts to recognize a pattern. As well as telling Billy's story, there is also a second ongoing narrative concerning another detective who accidently bumps into what he would regard as his own personal White.While this story has many characters, both minor and major players, this story is Billy's. His wife has major mood swings, his young boys are busy, and amusing, little hellions, and his father with advanced dementia that waxes and wanes live with them. A dedicated cop and family man, he also considers all the members of the WG to be family as well.Other than the colorful dialogue and writing, the appeal of this story is that no character is written as black and white. Their merits as well as their flaws are laid bare. Billy's love for his wife, his pride in his father's accomplishments before his brain started to deteriorate, even his adoration for his boisterous kids are apparent, as well as his fierce loyalty to his WG. But what really impressed me was how the other detective was written; while angry and vengeful, that detective is also shown as a family man. The WG are wonderfully more than two-dimensional. The reader cares for the characters.It's a well-written police procedural with compelling characters and a brilliant narrative. Some readers state that the beginning is slow and they are correct. The writer is building his story on the backs of a cast of many. The criminals are even referred to as ""actors"" and ""players"" by the detectives.Highly highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39OZLTYYIMCCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805093990#wasThisHelpful","R39OZLTYYIMCCG","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note that this is my first chain saw and the ease with which I was able to set it up and use it speaks volumes. Unlike the gas-powered saws that are able to travel without a power source, this electric saw is perfect for garden and property maintenance. It's lightweight, ergonomically balanced, and has just enough safety features to protect the user without being over-controlling. It starts with the push of a lever and press of a button--no yanking a starter cord. When you release the on button, the blade stops instantly. And I liked the cord lock so that you do not lose power by accidentally detaching the saw from an extension cord. Very safe.We have used it for firewood and for dismantling the old Christmas tree. With the little tree, it was more likely to catch on the branches and kick back. It cut through the firewood like carving butter and with zero kick back.Pay attention to the tightening feature or the chain will come off mid-use like it did for me. That is user-error only but it's a good thing to bear in mind. The self-sharpening feature is very easy to use. The manual that comes with the saw has simple, easy to follow directions. It comes with a plastic blade cover.It's a perfect tool for property maintenance and the price is comparable to the quality of the tool. I was very impressed with what it did for my needs.

"Sturdy, well-designed and with a price tag that will not break your budget, this Retrospec bike pump is one of the better floor pumps on the market. Too large for travel, the Retrospec is perfect for home base. With the three adaptors it can be used for bike tires or basketballs or even water toys. The hose is longer than most floor pumps and makes it that much easier to use. The barrel and the handles are steel with a comfortable padding covering the handles. I really like the 160 psi gauge: it is set on the barrel facing up at the user and comes with a moving setting indicator for your desired pressure.There is a clip to hold the tubing up off the ground.

"My son is a GoPro nut and so this Reach, GoPro-approved, is just perfect. It has a 14-40"" extension that makes the pole a nice compact, backpack size when fully collapsed. It extends with three interlocking pieces that can be secured at any length along the pole. The camera mount at the distal end is screw-in for better security. The lanyard at the handle unscrews so the end can be connected to a tripod mount making for an even longer pole for filming from a greater height.The pole is quite sturdy but it also makes for a heavier pole which can be uncomfortable if used for long periods of time. The extension mechanism is not smooth and needs an oiling or waxing to fix that. Some GoPro-friendly poles have a clip on the handle for the remote you get with the newer cameras, this does not. Also, at $55 this pole might not be affordable for some GoPro users.My son loves it. It should survive the ski slopes and the long board hills.

"The Wolf Winter, by Swedish author Cecilia Ekback, opens in the year 1717 with two young girls, immigrants from Finland, discovering the body of a local villager. His carcass is torn apart as though attacked by wolves but their mother, Maija, recognizes the work of something more frightening than a wolf: a human. In their tiny mountain village, occupied by no more than a dozen families, the fact that one of them is capable of murder is a chilling discovery. As the townspeople are willing to blame the death on wolves, Maija is determined to discover the true nature of the man's death.For those who voraciously devour murder mysteries, this book is different from the crime novels that are solved by the end of the week. Wolf Winter begins in the early fall and does not resolve until spring. The intrusion of the church, the villagers' distrust of the indigenous Lapps, and a deadly, snowstorm plagued winter, obstruct Maija's commitment to find the murderer. Left on her own with her two young girls, Frederika and Doratea, Maija is forced to brave, and survive, as an outsider in this hostile environment. Her struggle was so absorbing it made this reader forget about the murder and focus on her day-to-day struggle against the frigid weather and alienation from fear-driven villagers.While beautifully written, Wolf Winter does have parts of the book that feel as if it's meandering. Most passages are short, some with seemingly inconsequential events like Maija darning socks or Frederika taking her little sister to school. As the winter intensifies, the book grows more mystical with religious, and arcane, symbolism. Frederika's part in the story expands as she begins to interact with the Lapp tribe that the villagers distrust. She also begins to discover more about herself as a young woman, an element of this story that some readers found to be inconsistent with her age. Taking into consideration the century in which this story takes place and how people lived shorter lives and consequently had to grow up faster, some of Frederika's actions make sense.Wolf Winter is a fascinating and beautifully written debut novel. The women are written as strong and independent survivors of their environment. And when the story finished, I found myself thinking about them for days. While initially annoyed at how slowly the story advanced, with the murder mystery seemingly part of the background, I recognized in the end that it was all a complex part of the big picture. There is more to this story than just the murder as it turns out humans are much more predatory and beastly than any wolf.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW4OXTVE4CUSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602862524#wasThisHelpful","RW4OXTVE4CUSW","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband runs a small recording studio, which, among other projects, often is requested to record full bands in a single room - for that ""live"" feel and sound.  According to him, anyone who has ever attempted such a recording knows full well how much the snare drum resonates when another instrument plays in its proximity.  This is often mitigated in an ad-hoc fashion, such as duct tape, jellies, or a cloth over the snare drum.  While these methods are moderately effective, they tend to alter the sound of the snare to a point that one must ""fix it in the mix"".  Along comes the Puresound Snare Wire.  While he is quite the traditionalist when it comes to new fangled gadgets, he tells me this one seemed quite promising.  The quick mount/release required a bit of attention to the instructions, which are fortunately made clear via written and photographic instructions on the packaging.  A few simple steps and it's on the drum.  The strands are slightly heavier than most snare wires, which gave him concern as to how it would resonate when the drum is struck.  The strands tensioned quite nicely, with room for simple adjustment per one's taste.  With a bit of experimenting, he was able to get a very clear, sharp report form the snare, which came through nicely in a top/bottom mic set up.  When tested with a loud guitar, bass guitar, and live vocals in the recording room, the strand proved most useful.  The usual resonant noise associated with a snare in the same room as those instruments was far less prevalent than with any snare wire he'd used before.  He didn't have to over tighten the wires, or ad jellies or tape to the head to eliminate ""snare buzz"".  The result was a snare that had ample punch while not disrupting the other instruments playing along live in the room.  This not only saved effort, it saved time.  He was able to dial in a great full band sound with a drum that, while present in the mix, did not interfere with the other frequencies in the room.  All in all, for a price that is commensurate with many quality snare wires, this is a great set of wires for live and recording settings.  The wires are sturdy, resonate properly, and allow for a great mix with less effort to the engineer.  Just for shivers and giggles (his words) he might get another set for a piccolo snare.  Give them a try - he thinks you'll like `em!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MU2GJCAK3WZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZNU1M6#wasThisHelpful","R2MU2GJCAK3WZ8","A1JISH2AQDW1YW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JISH2AQDW1YW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was almost counting down the days until its release.With that said, upon completion of the movie (which I almost walked out on), I was very disappointed, to say the least.  This movie just misfires on all cylinders. Carrey and Daniels overacted throughout the entire movie.  What made Dumb and Dumber great, was the subtleness and intelligence of their stupidity.  In this movie, it's just straight up stupid, slapstick, failed attempts at humor.I would give it 1.5 stars, but I have to give it 1 since amazon's rating system doesn't allow for half stars.

"This may be one of the worst tasting natural bars I have ever consumed.  The ingredient list looked good, the label was nice, the company seems like they have a good mission, but wow, this bar is terrible.  There really isn't much else you can say about this bar.  It's sweeter than plain table sugar, first off.  I have no idea how they could possibly make something taste this sweet, but they did.  It's literally sweeter than straight sugar packets.  Secondly, because it's so sweet and sticky, it hurts my teeth.  Lastly, they don't digest well.  They sat like a rock in my stomach.

"Jeffrey Gitomer is extremely cocky.  I feel like you'll either like him, or you'll hate him.  His writing style and his bragging throughout the book was a gigantic turnoff for me.  I couldn't stop thinking how much I wanted to punch him, the further along the book I read.With that said, the actual sales content of this book is lacking.  It's really more about mindset, organization, confidence, branding yourself, and such.  I have read far greater sales books.  Zig Ziglar, Brian Tracy, Tom Hopkins, Jim Rohn, and such, they're the ones you want to go to for actual sales content.  I have seen a few reviewers mention this, and I will as well, this is more like ""How to train your mind for Sales Success"" than an actual sales book.I wasn't a fan of this book.

"I actually like this book better than the updated version, Diet Recovery 2.  This book emphasizes cleaner eating. I tried the ""eat anything you want"" approach in Diet Recovery 2 and felt AWFUL.This book is about more salt, sugar and saturated fat, but eating whole foods and drinking less fluid (especially water).This book is just what the doctor ordered for me.  I firmly believe in the dangers of ""8 glasses of water"" per day, when someone has a low metabolism.  I have experienced it first hand. I drink a 16 ounce bottle of water, and within 60-90 seconds, I feel freezing cold.  It's been happening to me for 10 years, but I never put 2 and 2 together, because water is ""healthy"", right?Another thing I noticed, is that the higher my calorie intake was, the more ""normal"" I started to feel.  Instead of needing a winter coat when it was 55 degrees out. But, like I said before, eating wholesome nutritious foods the key for me.  Eating ice cream sandwiches, pretzels, McDonald's and all of the other junk that Matt Stone suggests in Diet Recovery 2 didn't work. However, eating whole foods worked like a charm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBR8UARNB5D3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFG09FU#wasThisHelpful","RBR8UARNB5D3X","A1DIFL0333QPEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DIFL0333QPEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw these at a local health food store and was excited.  I figured it was more of a matcha green tea in a sachet, since it didn't need heated water.  Opened the pouch and it was normal leaf tea.  Thought this was weird, but whatever.  I excitedly put a pouch in a 16 ounce water bottle.  Shook the living daylights out of it for a minute, as per the directions.  Nothing.  Looked and tasted like normal water.  I tried again, another minute.  Barely had any taste or color.  This process went on for almost five minutes.  The end result was a very tired forearm, and basically water, with a super slight hint of green tea flavor in it.I tried again a few days later, same result.  I used the rest of the sachets in hot water like a normal tea bag, since it doesn't work at all in cold or room temperature water.  Will certainly never buy again.

"As a lifelong Pearl Jam fan, I have to admit, ""Backspacer"" was my least favorite Pearl Jam album to date. I wasn't sure about ""Lightning Bolt"".  I kind of lost faith in them after that album, but of course, I bought this album the second it came out.Right from the first track, ""Getaway"", this album had my attention.  What a great song to kickstart the album.  One of Pearl Jam's best songs in years.  Then it goes right into ""Mind Your Manners"", which had some decent success on Alt Rock charts prior to the release.  ""Father's Son"" follows that, which is another very good song.  Interesting lyrics to that one.  And then following that, comes ""Sirens"", which may be Pearl Jam's best song in over a decade.  What a beautiful, introspective song that is.  I'm skipping ahead, but keeping in line with introspective songs, ""Future Days"", the last song on the CD, is also a beautiful song.  One of my favorite on the album.The album has a few lows.  I'm not a fan of the songs Lightning Bolt, Pendulum, Yellow Moon, and the recycled Sleeping By Myself (which I thought was a really lame move by PJ, re-recording an Eddie Vedder Solo Album song).All in all, it's a solid album, and I'm very happy with the effort.  Eddie's lyrics are as brilliant as ever, and the band is still going incredibly strong in their late 40's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22CWU166PHBR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW1WR14#wasThisHelpful","R22CWU166PHBR9","A1DIFL0333QPEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DIFL0333QPEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Green Tea is my favorite drink, but I'm not a snob about it.  I like the majority of Green Tea I drink.  I do have my favorites, but I appreciate nearly all bagged Green Tea.  This one didn't make the cut.The tea bags are weird.  They seem really cheap quality.  Maybe that's why I bought this box of 100 for $6.  Also, the tea itself, no matter how long you steep it, barely has any taste.  It's one of the weaker Green Teas you'll ever drink.  I've steeped this tea for an hour, and all it did was turn bitter.  It still hardly had any of the traditional Green Tea taste.I did actually make it through the box of 100, because like I said, I love Green Tea, but I won't be buying this one again.

"There are a LOT of wheatgrass powders on the market. Most of them use whole wheatgrass, which means there is useless fiber in the drink, that's gritty and won't dissolve.  Not this brand.  This is wheatgrass JUICE powder.  Big difference.  It's basically wheatgrass shots with the water removed.This is a pure product.  The only ingredient is organic wheatgrass juice.  The taste is pretty bad.  I'm not going to lie.  If you're sensitive to strong tastes, you may not be able to drink this just mixed with water.  Even mixed with juice, it's far from delicious.  You even taste it strongly in a fruit smoothie. It basically ruins the smoothie. Bottom line, wheatgrass isn't tasty any way you spin it, lol.Getting back to the purity of the product, for straight wheatgrass powders, this one of the best I've seen.  Great product, if you can choke it down.  I'm pretty good with bad tasting things, but this is even too much for me.  I can't drink this stuff, unfortunately.  That's not to say it's a bad product.

"I actually asked around, to see if this was a B-Sides album, after I listened to it for the first time.  It's the weakest material to date Jay-Z has ever released.  I was hoping for way more, given the fact that the hype surrounding this album was off the charts.I honestly think Jay-Z is being stretched in way too many directions right now, with the new baby, the whole Brooklyn Nets thing, the Sports Agent.  It seems like his creativity was shot on this album.  There honestly isn't ONE memorable song on the entire album.  Not one.  One could potentially argue ""Holy Grail"" is a memorable song, and if that's you, I won't argue with you.  To me, it's a Justin Timberlake song featuring Jay-Z.  It's basically Justin's song.  Jay-Z does a guest rap on the song real quick, and Justin sings the rest of the time.I see there are a lot of fake, planted reviews on here, as there usually is.  Be wary of the 5-star reviews that are 1-sentence long, and it's the only review they've ever written.  Those are phony, planted reviews to bring up the overall score.  This album is a 1-2 star album, tops.  Jay-Z's worst, by far.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ZAQF7XWQW0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMRNMRQ#wasThisHelpful","R7ZAQF7XWQW0Y","A1DIFL0333QPEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DIFL0333QPEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start this review off with a disclaimer: it doesn't taste good.  Some people I know can't even tolerate it.  If you're really sensitive to tastes, I would advise against buying this product.  If you need your protein powders to taste like candy, you're in the wrong category here.This cacao version of Raw Meal is a HUGE upgrade in taste from the original flavor, which is what I imagine sewer water would taste like.  The cacao version at least mostly drowns out the sewer water taste.  It just tastes like bland, odd tasting dark chocolate, for the most part.  The product DOES have stevia in it to sweeten, but you wouldn't even know it, by the total lack of sweetness.  I actually prefer a non-sweet drink, so I'm glad about that.  Although I still think it could use a LITTLE more stevia.Now, onto the nutrition.  You absolutely will not find a more nutritious meal replacement/protein powder on the market. I've looked -- there isn't one out there.  Vega Sport is loaded with synthetic vitamins and insoluble fiber, which will tear apart a sensitive digestive tract.  This Raw Meal has 16g of fiber, 13g of which is soluble fiber, so it's lowering cholesterol and binding bile acids, in addition to providing you with 34g of protein per meal.  Not only that, it also contains almost 100% of RDA for many vitamins and minerals, and they are their raw, whole food form, which is incredible!  The product is also loaded with nutrients that are associated with sprouting, such as SOD (super oxide dismutase), CoQ10, glutathione, etc.  This product is an absolute powerhouse.  Better than anything else I've found, and very affordable as well.  Less than $2.50 per meal for a serving of this.I highly recommend this product -- but again, only to those who don't care about how something tastes.  If you are a big taste person or have sensitive taste buds, this might not be for you.  I have seen a few people struggle with the taste, so much so that they had to throw it out or give it away.  There are tricks you can do, such as adding your own stevia, fruit, or juice to it.  But I'm telling you, it STILL tastes weird.  I don't care though, because I can drink straight Kale juice without much problem.  And that's about as gross as you can get.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29TD0MJXAS51F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007S6Y6VS#wasThisHelpful","R29TD0MJXAS51F","A1DIFL0333QPEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DIFL0333QPEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album is awful.  There's really no other way to say it.  I don't even know where to begin with this review.  It's like Justin is trying way too hard to be different and be unique with this album, rather than putting out well rounded music, suitable to his style.We've seen this before.  An artist or band that has a ton of success under the belts try to deviate far away from what made them successful in the first place.  And I understand why artists do it.  As a creative human being, you try to reach new heights.  You try to re-invent yourself.  You try to add another dimension to your craft.  But 9 times out of 10, it doesn't work.  And quite often, it's a disaster.  I wouldn't necessarily call this album a disaster, per se.  But, it's just flat out terrible.We all know Justin Timerlake can act; and he can sell the hell out of the characters he plays, but he can't sell me on this experimental music.  The music sounds forced, jumbled, and half the time, it doesn't even sound like he knew where he was going with the particular song or rhythm.  It's just a complete mess.  There are a few moments of positive vibes on the record, but the highs are few and far between the many, many lows.  TKO is far and away the best song on the album.Just a quick FYI, on sites like this, when you see a 1 sentence, 5-star review on a music album, a good portion of the time, it's the record company writing a phony review to artificially boost the ratings.  This is fact.  Don't pay attention to the ton of 5-star reviews this album got.  Just read through them.  Many of them are 1 sentence long, and it's the only review that person ever wrote. Prototypical fake review, that was placed by the record company. When you read the 3, 2, 1 star reviews, you see intelligent, well written reviews, that generally echo the thoughts that most have on the album.  That's not to say ALL of the 5-star reviews are fake, but many of them are.  Check it out of yourself.

"I have seen some people scoff at the price of this product. It's basically a little over $1 per serving. When you go into a convenience store and want a bottle of water, often you pay $1 to $1.25 for a 16 ounce bottle.  This stuff is basically the price of store bought water, so any complaints about the price are ridiculous.This is a great alternative to Gatorade.  My only issue with this product is it doesn't contain much sodium, which is an essential component of any sports drink, due to the fact that we lose so much salt during exercise.What I do, is put about 1/8 to 1/4 of a tsp of pink sea salt into 16 ounces of water, pour in the Rebound FX, and now it becomes a fully balanced electrolyte drink, with the full spectrum of 60 minerals, as well as some vitamins, EGCG, and other nutrients. With how big of a fan Dr. Wallach is about salt, I wonder why he doesn't put basically any salt in this sports drink.That's my only issue with it.

They're much, much more subtle tasting, and I like the consistency better as well.  These Life Lift bars are the perfect amount of sweetness, and taste fairly natural.I question the fat content of these bars, however.  The label claim is 8g of fat, but the bars are extremely oily.  It could just be the oil from the almond butter separating from the bar.

"Juice Plus is normal fruit and vegetable juice concentrate powder put into capsules.  If you're a reasonably intelligent person, you can buy fruit and vegetable juice powder in bulk, from various manufacturers for literally 1/10th the cost.  These bottles of Juice Plus cost no more than $5 to manufacture, if I had to guess.  The bottling and labeling is probably more costly than the product in the capsules.The outlandish, ridiculous claims this company makes is mind boggling. I don't know how they haven't been shut down for fraud.  Clever ""loophole"" wording, and high priced lawyers are probably how this company continues to stay open, and peddles this overpriced garbage.I'm not saying these capsules provide NO nutritional benefit, but to get any substantial benefit from them, you'd have to take 10-20 capsules a day, which would not be very cost effective.  When you buy a standard fruit/vegetable juice powder concentrate, you routinely take 1 TBSP (15 grams) of the powder.  These capsules are 750mg, so therefore, you would need to take 20 to get what I would call a nutritionally substantial dosage.I have taken this product and noticed zero benefit, because there's little to no benefit to be found in the miniscule dosages these capsules provide.  If you're taking this stuff and you're having the placebo effect, great.  Keep taking it. Placebo is just as powerful as anything.  But for someone who's not easily fooled, spend your money elsewhere.Gram for gram, this might be the most expensive nutritional supplement ever created, when you factor in the dosage needed to have significant effects on someone's nutritional profile.Again, I'm not saying this is a BAD quality supplement.  It's just misleading, insanely expensive, and putting the powder in capsules instead of offering a powder is a convenient way to rip you off even further.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SB5X8S3PDT3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015NHRE8#wasThisHelpful","R2SB5X8S3PDT3G","A1DIFL0333QPEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DIFL0333QPEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beyond Tangy Tangerine's label claim says 1g sugar, 7g carbohydrates.  The 6g of carbs must be from maltodextrin, which is in essence, a sugar as well, because it's off the charts on the glycemic index.  When I take a serving of BTT, I get a sugar reaction, as if I just mowed down 5 chips a'hoy cookies.  It's really uncanny.  So, I honestly question the label claims.  Maybe it's the maltodextrin that's causing a reaction, I'm not sure.  But this product gives me bloat, like I said, worse than if I ate a gigantic pastry.What I do know, is that while I'm sure this product has benefits, if you can digest it properly, for me, it causes awful digestive reactions.  I have been taking Dr. Wallach's Ultimate Classic, which is basically the liquid form of this product for years with NO negative reactions... and that has 7.5g of sugar per serving!  Also, I take Youngevity's ""Rebound FX"" product, which too has 7g of sugar per serving, and I digest that just fine.  Something's funny with this product.If I had to guess, it's the maltodextrin giving me a reaction.  But, needless to say, I can't tolerate it.  I will go back to Youngevity's Ultimate Classic, Colloidal Minerals, and I'll stay with Rebound FX.  Beyond Tangy Tangerine is NOT for me.  This was an extremely expensive failed experiment.

The difference between the normal bulbs and these in terms of brightness, was like 7PM sun compared to 12 noon sun.  Literally twice as bright, or so it seems.

"I've been suffering from low body temperature and low pulse for 15+ years now.  I'm usually around 96.5 to 97.0 body temp, and 50-56 pulse. Both are too low.  Thyroid issues are clearly to blame.I came across the idea of using Thyroid Glandulars, and this one seemed like a good fit.  I started off taking 1 capsule a day.  Within a week, my body temperatures were a steady 97.9.  A HUGE increase.  It stayed level for another week or two, so I decided to bump it up to 2 capsules per day.  My body temp jumped even more, to 98.1.  For the first time in a LONG time, I had ""near normal"" body temperatures.  My pulse also went from 55 to about 64, which is a lot more normal.Finally, I bumped it up to 3 capsules per day, which is what I needed to get me to the wonderful 98.6 number.  That did it, 1 capsule, 3x per day.  Keep in mind, I haven't seen 98.6 temperatures in my body since I was a teenager (I'm mid 30's now). This is very interesting and exciting to see and feel such differences in my body.  It's so weird to me sitting in a 68 degree air conditioned room and not feeling like I'm going to freeze to death.From all of the research I have done on human health, we should be at 98.6-99.0 body temperature, and 75-85 pulse.  When I first began this supplement, I was 96.9 temp, 55 pulse.  After a month on the product, I am 98.6 temp, 68 pulse.**Update: I stopped taking the product for about a month, after I was 98.1-98.6 for awhile.  I figured I was cured, so stopped taking it altogether.  Not so fast.  Within a month, my average daily temperature dropped to 97.1, and I started feeling cold all the time again.  Just an FYI, if you do use this product, you should probably stay on it for awhile.  17 years of thyroid issues don't cure themselves in a month, lol.**","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYHIYWISQJYL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006L7T61U#wasThisHelpful","RYHIYWISQJYL6","A1DIFL0333QPEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DIFL0333QPEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been hearing hype about this product for over 2 years. Mike Adams from Natural News did a video on it, lots of other health advocates have been singing its praises as well. I finally decided to take the plunge, to see what the heck this stuff was about. I have used every other brown rice protein product on the market, and they've all been chalky, and gross. I expected this to be different though, based on the hype. Well, I was wrong.This product is chalky and gritty, just like every other brown rice protein product out there. It's SLIGHTLY less gritty than others, but it's still gritty, and gross. The ONLY way to make this palatable is to add a buttload of fruit, stevia, xylitol, honey, or some other masking agent to it. On its own? Forget about it. Not going to happen, unless your taste buds have been burned off.Ok, so the taste is bad, how about results? It doesn't even feel like I'm consuming protein. When I drink whey protein, my muscles soak it up. I feel stronger. I feel like I want to lift things. With this protein, I feel like I drank a pure fruit smoothie or something. I don't feel strong. I don't feel like lifting. My muscles don't feel full. I get no traditional protein benefits from this formula, so I HIGHLY question the digestibility of this so-called wonder protein.The only plant-based protein I've ever used that works was PlantFusion. It's a combo of plant proteins, that form complete proteins, but I stopped using it because they add Fructose as a sweetener. It's the only plant based protein I've ever used, that made me feel strong, like I was actually ingesting protein. With this Sunwarrior protein, I might as well be eating actual brown rice, because I'm not getting much, if any, usable protein with this formula. And for as bad as the taste is? Forget it. Not worth it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OKJR5RO1BYVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039D897G#wasThisHelpful","R3OKJR5RO1BYVF","A1DIFL0333QPEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DIFL0333QPEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a knock-off product, folks.  It's not being sold or made by the actual Alkalife company.  I believe it's a Korean or Japanese ""clone"" product.  With that said, the product works!  I used this stuff for 5 years without even knowing I was using a counterfeit product.  I've been singing the praises for Alkalife ever since, so it obviously works great.  I bought a 24 pack of these knock-off Alkalife bottles 6 years ago, and I still have like 2 left.  They still work great, to this day.If you feel leery about getting a knock off product, understandable.  But chemicals are chemicals.  You can actually go to any chemical lab and buy potassium-sodium hydroxide by the gallon for dirt cheap.

"I have never been a huge Fall Out Boy fan.  Been more of a casual fan.  I've liked a number of their singles, but never liked any of their albums as a whole.  The albums were just never strong enough for me to hold my attention and interest in the band very much.With the sad state of rock music these days, I was left listening to virtually nothing on my iPad, so I decided to give this new album a shot.  I figured the long hiatus would either be great for the band, or the album would be an absolute clunker.  I'm happy to say for the sake of the band, and for my own listening pleasure, the album is very good.  In my opinion, the best Fall Out Boy album to date, from top to bottom.In semi-unrelated news, I almost didn't recognize Patrick Stump when I saw a clip of the band performing live.

"For years, I was fed the lie that ""Extra Virgin Coconut Oil"" is the only coconut oil we should be using.  I used it, but hated it.  It always made me nauseous, and I absolutely hated the taste.  Never been a fan of coconuts in my life, never will be.  Every day with it was a struggle, and yet, it made me feel sick!I started reading the work of Ray Peat, and realized that a good majority of the population has an allergy to coconuts, and coconut oil.  When the coconut oil is refined or expeller pressed, the allegen (protein) is removed, and not only can people start enjoying a coconut-free taste, but you will also start seeing the benefits of the oil.  Gone are the days of coconut oil making me nauseous, and feeling crappy.  Now it makes me feel oxygenated, healthy, warm, and balanced. Kudos to Ray Peat for turning me onto Expeller Pressed Coconut Oil!Great stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSV7QV1DQKEZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006H9QX6S#wasThisHelpful","RSV7QV1DQKEZC","A1DIFL0333QPEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DIFL0333QPEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hans De Jong is an amazing teacher/lecturer/speaker.  His work, of course, is based on The Silva Method, which was founded by Jose Silva, but I've listened to several teachers on the Silva Method, including Jose Silva himself (when he was alive), and Hans is far and away the best.This audio program was one of the first self-help courses I ever listened to, and 10 years later, it's STILL probably the best.  It's not pie-in-the-sky stuff.  It's no nonsense, factual information, on how to improve your life, and get rid of limiting, negative false beliefs.  I don't like pie-in-the-sky, fairy tale kind of stuff, that gets you all motivated, but then you end up falling short, because you're lost on the ""how to"". Hans tells you exactly what you need to do, to be successful.Going to ""Alpha"", which is another way of saying using Binaural Beat Meditation, is extremely helpful in helping you center yourself, for your goal setting, and visualization.  It's always best to set your goals and visualize them in this kind of state.  When you're doing it in other brainwave states, it's just dreaming, but doing it in Alpha, you're uncovering ways to bring about the change you need, in order to reach your goals.I love Hans De Jong's accent as well.  Very pleasant speaking voice.

"I loved Dragon Warrior I.  Absolutely loved it.  Dragon Warrior II was a great advancement on the original game, although I felt it was ridiculous at times, with the difficulty level.Dragon Warrior III is almost the perfect RPG game.  It's EXTREMELY long, very complex, yet simplistic at the same time, due to the limitations of 8-bit graphics (which I actually enjoy... I don't like Graphics heavy storylines).  The addition of things like character classes mix things up nicely.  Even things like turning a Wizard into a Sage is a very cool feature.  Takes your wimpy, weak Wizard character and can eventually turn him into a pretty strong character.I honestly wish they never stopped making Dragon Warrior games for NES.

"Very choppy sound and video on the Fire Stick and on PC. I've researched this and find the Fire Stick is not to blame, nor is my connection. What is to blame is the HBO Now service itself. HBO, in all its infinite wisdom, doesn't allow the video to buffer more than a few seconds and when the buffer refills you get the stutter. They do this to avoid piracy, but somehow Prime Video, Netflix and YouTube stream without a hitch. HBO's paranoia over losing a penny has created a basically unusable app that they charge fifteen dollars a month to try and use (and will, ironically, drive more people to find other ways to watch HBO video). Speaking of the fifteen dollars -- why am I paying this much for an app that has ADVERTISING before the show you want to watch? It's already annoying on Prime when they do it and they don't always do it -- HBO Now is more expensive and shows advertisements every single time. It's really a shame it's not watchable, as the content is very good.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GEVJHBD6VI9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZFCVK4#wasThisHelpful","R2GEVJHBD6VI9K","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"RETURN OF THE JEDI Review:The worst of the original 3 films (but I'd put money on it being much better than ""The Force Awakens""). Yes, there is an awesome puppet creation in Jabba the Hutt, but it also has teddy-bears destroying the Empire. It's ridiculous. Han Solo acts like he's been brain-damaged by the carbonite and turned into an old-timey comedian. Luke isn't as much of a Jedi as he is Luke who we're told is a Jedi. The ""sister"" angle is wedged in and embarrassing. The premise of being told you HAVE to DESTROY Vader and yet being told you'll turn to the Dark Side if you strike him down is pure insanity. Another Death Star with basically the same exact weakness is silly and shameful. C3PO being this great storyteller after claiming he's not very good at telling stories in A New Hope is lazy or ignorant of a movie that was released half a decade earlier. This movie was George just wanting to get his ""9 part"" saga over in 3 sections. Complaining aside, it does have an AMAZING space battle and a pretty groovy speeder bike chase through Endor. Also, it puts a proper end to the saga. I don't care if Mickey Mouse has decided the saga isn't truly over ... it is -- the fan fiction from J.J. doesn't count.The Movie Itself: 7 out of 10RETURN OF THE JEDI Picture Quality:The picture quality of Return of the Jedi on Blu is second only to Revenge of the Sith. There's less DNR than in any of the other 5 and it really does look like it did on the big screen. If not for the large amount of uncleaned grain during the Tatooine scenes, I'd say it looked better than it did theatrically.Picture Quality: 10 out of 10RETURN OF THE JEDI Sound Quality:Like every Star Wars' blu, excluding Sith, the sound is as good as modern technology gets.Sound Quality: 10 out of 10RETURN OF THE JEDI 2011 changes:Jabba's palace has a bigger door made of CG.Han thawing from carbonite is slightly different (through CG).A Dug is added to one scene, but takes away from nothing.Ewoks have blinking CG eyes.R2D2's attack is now over-the-top CG.Darth Vader says ""No"" and then says, ""Noooo.""

"A NEW HOPE Review:What can be said that hasn't been said already? A New Hope introduced us to this crazy universe. It was like nothing we had ever seen. It was Flash Gordon for a new generation. It was pure amazement. It redefined the word ""entertainment"" and, because of that, lines of geeks and non-geeks surrounded every theater playing the film. Aside from the dated 70s looking computers (which is a change I wish George Lucas or Disney WOULD make) and a few clunky lines from the actors (mainly Mark Hammill), the movie is pure perfection.The Movie Itself: 10 out of 10A NEW HOPE Picture Quality:There's quite a bit of DNR toward the beginning -- especially on Princess Leia's face, but it lessens throughout.

"REVENGE OF THE SITH Review:Revenge of the Sith is a bleak film. If you're a diehard fan, it comes close to being traumatic (but not in a bad way, like Jar Jar). Lucas didn't sell this one short. Not at all. Sure, it should have been at least 3 hours and expanded further on Anakin's change to the Dark Side. That said -- the Emperor thought he could change Luke in a matter of seconds in Return of the Jedi. So at least it makes a bit more of an effort. The opening space battle is incredible. The banter from the original trilogy is back and nearly lives up to to the sequels. This is a very good movie. It still suffers from some of the inane ""romantic"" dialogue between Anakin and his lover, but Star Wars' fans have learned to deal with some cheesiness. Honestly -- no SW film, like no pizza (at least no good pizza), is without cheese -- not even Empire.The Movie Itself: 10 out of 10REVENGE OF THE SITH Picture Quality:Unlike the first 2 DNR destroyed prequels, Revenge of the Sith looks GREAT! As a matter of fact, it's the best looking of all 6 films. The opening space battle is right up there with Avatar and Planet Earth as the best looking thing you'll ever see on blu-ray. This movie is, visually, reference quality. If you're proud of your set up and don't own this film, you no longer have a reason to be proud.Picture Quality: 10 out of 10REVENGE OF THE SITH Sound Quality:I guess -- if you're a Star Wars' fan -- you can't have it all.

"ATTACK OF THE CLONES Review:Attack of the Clones has always been -- prior to this blu-ray release -- my least favorite of the 6 movies in the saga. This release won me over. The movie is the best paced of the prequel trilogy. The downfall is the HIDEOUS ""romantic"" dialogue between Anakin and Padme. What a load of garbage. It's still as laughable and as intolerable as it was at the midnight screening over a decade ago. Fortunately, the rest of the movie holds up very well. This is the best directing Lucas has done since A New Hope (aside from his poor direction of actors). It moves at a brisk pace and keeps the viewer involved from start to finish (if you don't count the ""romantic"" scenes that bring the film to a screeching halt every so often).The Movie Itself: 7 out of 10ATTACK OF THE CLONES Picture Quality:Sadly, the movie suffers from the same DNR as Phantom Menace does on Blu. As it was shot digitally, it isn't as glaring, but there are a few moments of waxy-face that are nearly intolerable. On the other hand, the CG in the movie has never looked better. The end battle (which is essentially one big cartoon) has some breathtaking moments.Picture Quality: 7 out of 10ATTACK OF THE CLONES Sound Quality:Incredible. Amazing. Ear-shatteringly awesome!

"PHANTOM MENACE Review:The Phantom Menace has went from a beloved Star Wars' film in most fanboy eyes (""Not as good as A New Hope and Empire, but better than Return of the Jedi"" was the common refrain) to the most hated of the prequels. The movie definitely isn't all that it could be. It isn't even close. But it has the best lightsaber battle of the trilogy, an awesome opening sequence, and WAY less Jar Jar than you remember (it's just that he's so SHRILL whenever he appears). It's also the only Star Wars' prequel that FEELS like Star Wars. It has plenty of real sets and is structured much like the original 3.The Movie Itself: 7 out of 10PHANTOM MENACE Picture Quality:The picture quality of The Phantom Menace is the worst of the bunch on Blu. It's filled with TONS of annoying Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) leading to a LOT of clayface. And even with that, the digital FX are still much sharper than the filmed shots of actors (this was the last Star Wars' film to actually be shot on film -- at least until Episode VII), which leads to the actors oftentimes looking out-of-focus or ""blurred"" when compared to their annoying digital counterparts.Picture Quality: 6 out of 10 (still WAY better than the DVD)PHANTOM MENACE Sound Quality:The sound in the film is INCREDIBLE. It is some of the best surround sound ever produced on blu-ray. It genuinely sounds better than the the theatrical version.

"Pitch Black is an awesome ""B"" sci-fi movie. So is RIDDICK. The problem is The Chronicles of Riddick, which is a PG-13, watered-down, sellout. And it doesn't fit the character of Riddick, at all. Especially after the incredible, jaw-dropping game with Riddick titled, ""Escape from Butcher Bay"" (seriously, even if you HATE gaming, play this game -- it's hands down the best installment of this series). So this ""trilogy"" isn't quite so much as a trilogy as it is two really good, violent, no-holds-barred ""B"" sci-fi flicks surrounding this weird sort of wanna-be Shakespearean thing rated PG-13 and coming off as more of a parody of the first than an actual movie. It's all relatively entertaining and, if you're a fan of the character, I'd recommend buying the trilogy, but what is up with that second entry? It does drag the entire saga down. I suspect Vin Diesel was getting too big for his britches (steroids?) and we'll all be best to ignore the second installment. Even Vin agrees. Let's just pray for an R-rated fourth entry, to finish the series. Or not. Whatever.

"Frankenweenie obviously pays brilliant homage to the Universal horror classics, but also to newer horror flicks such as Gremlins and Godzilla. It is fun from beginning to end. The 3D is great, the picture quality -- both 2D and 3D -- is incredible. The movie is not to be missed.

"Wow! What an incredible transfer! I expect nothing but the best from Criterion and they rarely let me down, but this time they outdid even themselves. I cannot imagine this movie looking crisper when it was first released some 70 years ago. It also has a great set of extras, including the full sequel to the movie (which is a fun little film, for what it is, despite being Hitchcock-less).And the movie? It's still the same great Hitchcock classic you know and love. Widely considered his best film from his film-making days in Europe, Lady Vanishes combines a creepy aura of suspense, dread, conspiracy and paranoia with some clever and impeccably timed comedy. Hitch always added humor to even his most horrific films, but I don't think he ever quite achieved the ""peanut butter in my chocolate"" levels of humor and horror that he did in Lady Vanishes (The Trouble With Harry, despite being an inferior film, most likely comes closest).This is a fun movie given a second life thanks to a stunning video restoration and audio clean up that removes all noticeable hiss, snaps, crackles and pops (at least the ones that weren't meant to be there in the first place). Placing The Lady Vanishes on your shelf will do your collection proud -- if only there weren't so many great extras that all but guarantee it will spend as much time in your blu-ray player as it does in your blu-ray collection.NOTE: I just looked through my Criterion blus and the only other transfer that has impressed as much belongs to A Night to Remember.

"Exceeding expectations that weren't really there isn't that hard a task, but this is a very fun game. The premise is simple (as are most games created for tablets) -- take the cube and roll it around Q-Bert like platforms, picking up all the mini-cubes and get to your destination under a certain time to receive the perfect rating.

"The price on these Pistachios keeps rising and is inflated beyond belief. A bag of these should cost no more than $10. That said, the nut itself is divine. I haven't had many pistachios better than this. They're a little softer than pistachios usually are and have a fresh taste that really makes them stand out.

"I have played a lot of games lately, as my birthday and Christmas both occur in December. There has been some great games (Darksiders 2, Far Cry 3, The Walking Dead), some good games (Jak & Daxter Collection, Borderlands 2), some bad games (Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault, Epic Mickey 2) and then there's been Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. The ugliest, most rancid game I've played in all of 2012. Possibly this entire 7-year video game generation. Possibly, the worst game ever made. I'm not kidding.Let's get the ""good"" stuff in the game out of the way: The graphics are good and the voice acting is decent. That is all.Now for the bad:The control set up is literally the worst ever implemented in a major game. Why must you press the L2 button and the thumbstick to dodge? Why must you press ""down"" on the control stick and then a button to drop off a ledge instead of either down OR a button? Why are so many different actions assigned to the exact same buttons? The game ripped everything else off from God of War, why not its excellent control scheme?Cut scenes. I'm actually a fan of cut scenes in games, but I'm an even bigger fan of pacing. This game constantly interrupts battles with 30 second cut scenes to look at a tree or to zoom in on a swamp. It's ridiculous. And it makes the game impossible to enjoy. I don't mind QTEs, usually, but why can't a button prompt just pop on the screen? Why must it literally tell the gamer, every time, to ""Press R2 to do such and such an action""? Just show us the R2 button -- we can figure the rest out. And don't get me started on the horrible ""circle within a circle and then press any old random button when the circles align"" QTE in all boss fights and many other battles.Settings: A huge, huge part of the game takes place in what looks like the forest of Pandora from Avatar. It's as far from ""Castlevania"" as you can get. It's ugly level design. And it's not Castlevania (which makes sense, as this wasn't made as a Castlevania game; the title was just applied to sell copies of a game that would have otherwise went unnoticed).Level Design: Wow, what idiots designed these levels? I don't even know where to start, so I won't. This is, honestly, the worst level design I've seen since The Force Unleashed (the Star Wars' take on God of War), and it's quite a bit worse than that.Camera Angle: Again, the game ripped everything else off from God of War, why not its excellent camera? Lords of Shadow (I refuse to call this a ""Castlevania"" game, because it isn't) has a camera that's usually too far above the character, but sometimes comes in too close. You will lose sight of the baddies you're fighting in nearly every battle. It's not because I ""suck"" as a gamer, it's because the team behind this game suck as developers.Repetitive Gameplay: Someone could look at an Uncharted or a God of War and think the gameplay is repetitive, but this takes it to a whole 'nother level. While those two superior games -- both of which this one stole from -- change things up and keep things entertaining. They have significantly different ways to fight many varied bad guys and bosses. Castlevania? Jump up in the air to avoid ""ground pound"" shockwaves, stop for 25 seconds for a meaningless cut scene, press left trigger and thumbstick (again, why???) at the same time to dodge, stop for 25 seconds for a meaningless cut scene, press left trigger again to block (although many times you will accidentally dodge, as the same button is used for both), stop for 25 seconds for a meaningless cut scene, hit R2 when the white circle meets the white circle (good luck if the background matches the color of the circles you need to look at), stop for 25 seconds for a meaningless cut scene, do the circle thing again, press a random button, stop for 25 seconds for a meaningless cut scene and the fight is finally over. This is it. That is all. It is the gameplay from beginning to end and it is unbearably awful.I don't usually actively hate any game. I actually (and actively) hated Lords of Shadow. I felt insulted as a gamer just by playing it. I feel Konami insulted all Castlevania fans by putting the name ""Castlevania"" on this game that wasn't even designed to be a Castlevania title. I feel critics insulted themselves by ""overlooking"" the game's flaws for some extra swag or an exclusive interview. I hate everything about this game.

"Titanic was considered unsinkable. 3D conversions that could match the quality of native 3D films were considered undoable. We all know how the former turned out. The latter? It had a much happier ending.Titanic 3D is an absolute stunner. It steals the crown from the former king of 3D conversions, Alice in Wonderland. And it does so without breaking a sweat (not to mention, in 2D or 3D, it's a much better film). This movie really does look like it was shot in 3D. As a matter of fact, and startlingly, it doesn't look all that much worse than James Cameron's next picture, Avatar, which WAS filmed in 3D.I admit I didn't expect much when firing up the television and the bulky 3D glasses. When the movie started in the boggy underwater scenes taking place in present day (a present day that is now long past), I got exactly what I expected. A little bit of depth, but I was ready to declare Titanic 3D dead in the water. But then we go back in time. And we have Jack running alongside the ship, hoping for a ticket. Rose with her gigantic hat, that has never looked more ostentatious. And the ship itself.My gawd, the ship.Yes, we're dealing with CG that's well over a decade old, but Cameron isn't known to skimp on budgets and what we get still looks great. In 3D? It looks incredible. Cameron clearly wanted to put us in this infamous ship in the original and, with the 3D conversion, we're essentially there. The corridors. The engine rooms (oh my, how they impress in 3D!), the dining hall. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing this all looks in 3D.I felt like I was watching an entirely new movie.Does Titanic have the same overwrought ""dramatic"" dialogue as it did years ago? Of course. Does it still favor its fictional characters over the real life villains and heroes on the ship? Obviously. Will you care? No. If it didn't bother you before, it will bother you even less now.Titanic was and remains a really good movie. It has gotten a bum rap over the years, due to its somewhat clunky dialogue and the ""hipster"" status it gained back when Leo was all the rage. But it is undeserved. The movie is well more than competent, it's shamelessly romantic and, at 3 hours, it all goes by in a flash.My only 2 minor complaints with this release? The 3D movie is divided over two discs, which means you have to get taken out of the picture to switch discs. But it's well worth it, as compressing this onto a single disc would have never delivered the flawless picture we get with this blu-ray release. My second complaint is that we STILL don't get the movie James Cameron promised for home release.After winning his Best Picture Oscar, James said the theatrical film was for the romantics. That it focused on the fictional romance between Jack and Rose. But he said that the home video release would be for the historians. That it would be at least an hour longer and focus on the real life characters. It is sad that, to this day, this version of the movie has not been shown. Sure, we get an idea of what we're missing in the deleted scenes, but a 4 hour Director's Cut for us Titanic geeks out there would certainly have been appreciated -- especially if we were able to see it for our first time in 3D.Sadly, it was not to be. What we get instead is a great movie with an incredible 3D conversion that is truly demo quality in every single regard. 3D? Check. Audio? Check. 2D version? Perfection.This was the ""sink or swim"" release of the year. Fortunately for the fans, it swam like Michael Phelps. And everyone behind the Olympian feat of turning an aging movie into a modern 3D wonder should receive a gold medal for their efforts. I cannot praise this release highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RLSGIYKDEG3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006H5120E#wasThisHelpful","R2RLSGIYKDEG3T","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's nice to feel remembered. It's nice to know that, as a loyal gamer, you weren't forgotten.For a little bit ... in the dark days, the days before Resident Evil: Revelations ... the days of Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City; old-school RE fans -- the ones there from the beginning -- had reason to feel they had been cast aside. The series had stopped being horror and moved on to action, with heavy focus on co-op gaming. Resident Evil: Revelations changes all that.The game is single-player. The game has the old-school tank controls (at least if you're not using the Circle Pad Pro). And, best of all? The game has HORROR! Yes, Resident Evil is scary again. Plug it into a good set of speakers or nice pair of headphones and prepare to jump, scream, and just have a great, gory gaming experience.If you can imagine the jaw-droppingly great Resident Evil REmake on the GameCube mixed with the GameCube's Resident Evil 4 control setup, you'll know exactly what you're in for with Resident Evil: Revelations. The game lives up to the awesomeness you're imagining.Capcom didn't get lazy with this one, either. The graphics are stellar. These are console level graphics, as good as anything released so far on the more powerful Vita system. The game is lengthy -- expect a good 10 hours of gameplay. The story is deep (well, as deep as an RE story ever gets). The level design, the character design, the weapon design, the weapon upgrade system ... everything is top-notch.And no, to answer your question, you don't need the circle pad pro to play this. In my opinion, it plays better without it and plays far more like the older Resident Evil games you've grown used to.I paid double what this is currently selling for and still thought it was well worth the price. If you own a 3DS and don't own this game yet, what are you waiting for? Order. Now. This thing is a system seller.Note: I have nothing against 3D and there are some games (Super Mario 3D Land, for one) I love playing with 3D cranked to full, but the 3D in RE: Revelations just didn't work for me. The game is much prettier with the 3D off. It's also too easy to lose the ""sweet spot"" in combat and end up staring at a blurry mess of a screen. Your mileage may vary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTN7RFN64XMK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SVLI2#wasThisHelpful","RTN7RFN64XMK6","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is creepy and awesome, all at the same time. When you stick it on stuff (it's magnetic), it looks just like a Spider with half its legs removed. But when you turn that light on? WOW! It is BRIGHT (so BRIGHT, all CAPS must be used to describe its magnificence). My girlfriend and I are in the middle of landscaping the meadow we've spent the last year creating in our backyard and this thing has been invaluable. We've stuck it on the roof of the garage and had it shining down on us as we test the solar lights we're using to line the path to the picnic & BBQ area we're setting up. When we need more mobility? One of us simply wraps the thing around our arm (there's the creepy ""spider"" part again) and uses it like a ""flashlight bracelet.""This light goes FAR (although it is a concentrated beam and only lights up the specific thing you are pointing at)! Our yard is exactly one acre and we can light each other up from opposite ends. What a wonderful invention (one of those, ""Wish I woulda thought of that!"" type things) and an essential item to own if you do anything outside, inside, in your garage, or enjoy artificial light during times when genuine light is not available. In other words? Buy this! You won't regret the purchase.Disclaimer: It is smaller than it looks. I expected a big spotlight type thing as shown in sci-fi movies like E.T. or Close Encounters. This is honestly what it says it is -- a super bright flashlight with bendy spider legs. The light itself is the size of a flashlight, not an E.T. or Close Encounters beam of Spielbergian magic made to light up the night sky. Even so, reading this review, you can see it turned out to be more than enough, despite not being as much as I expected.I absolutely love this thing (despite it being sort of creepy with its sticky spider legs that eagerly wrap themselves around anything and everything that can be wrapped).

"This game defines FUN! Yes, it's a screwball, over-the-top rip-off of Grindhouse -- but who doesn't want to play a screwball, over-the-top rip-off of Grindhouse? If you answered, ""I don't!"" this game isn't for you. For everyone else? This game is pure perfection.So why the 4 stars? Because the developers had 2 years to work on this after the Wii version and they only added 2 fun -- but short (shorter than usual) -- levels. It's ridiculous that at least 3 or 4 new levels couldn't be added. Or, at the very least, 2 very LONG levels exclusive to the PS3.The other thing I don't like is that you have the option to play it with a traditional controller. This is a ""light-gun"" game -- play with a traditional controller and you pretty much miss everything. This is for the Move and for the Move only. And if you play with the Move? You'll have a BLAST (literally).I can't explain why this game is so much fun (seriously, I can't -- if I did, my review would be censored). I can just say that I played through it on the Wii at least 3 times and, so far, I've played through the PS3 version by myself twice and with my girlfriend once, with my mom (yes -- my mom) once and with a couple of friends! I have went through this game 9 times (6 times on the PS3, alone)!What does the Move bring to the game? Far more accuracy, for a start. The Move wand (or whatever that sno-cone lookin' thing is officially called) is far more accurate than the Wiimote. The aforementioned 2 new levels (both fun, but, as I said, both short) and 3D.If you have a 3DTV, put them glasses on and be transported back to the earliest days of 3D horror! This is House of Wax stuff (the Vincent Price version). Sega did a GREAT job adding EXTREME 3D to this game. Stuff flies out at you. Bosses scream, stick their ugly heads out of the screen and essentially push their nasty fingernails into your face. It's awesome, if you're into that sorta stuff. And if you're playing this game ... you are.House of the Dead: Overkill - Extended Cut isn't everything it could have been. Online play would have been the icing on the cake. A couple more exclusive new levels would have brought up the value. But this game, as it is, can be played again and again with friend after friend (not to mention your girlfriend and your mother, if they're not prudes).My only other complaint is it's already a few bucks less than when I bought it. But that's all the better for you! If you like horror. If you like cheese. If you like grindhouse. If you have a steady hand and good aim? Well, what are you waiting for? This game proves, once again, that the Move controller for the PS3 is the greatest motion controller of all time. Plop down your cash now.

"I have 2 dogs and my girlfriend has a cat, leaving the house full of dander, dust and all other assorted allergens (like a gift-bag of coughs and sneezes).

Those are a little tougher to fight off, but they've definitely been reduced with the help of this filter and some allergy meds.The biggest surprise though, has been the reduction of odor. The house no longer smells like dog dander. It is so noticeable, a friend of ours who had no idea we switched filters commented on how our house no longer, ""stinks like dog"" (which, in a way, was a backhanded compliment). ""Did you clean?"" He asked. ""We always clean,"" we responded. ""But we did change filters."" Needless to say, he was impressed. And so are we.So, if you don't like sneezing, coughing, runny eyes, hives or having your house ""stink like dog,"" this filter is for you. I'd give it a 5 out of 5 but the price is pretty extreme and just looking at what the filter's picked up already -- after being in use for just over a week -- tells me that it will need to be replaced monthly, not every 3 months as we were hoping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F8B2U3D1K53D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F5D6GU#wasThisHelpful","R3F8B2U3D1K53D","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you ever get tired of reading Harry Potter Page to Screen, you could use it as an arm weight, or tie it to a Horcrux and throw it in the Black Lake to create sunken treasure (or give those poor mermaids something to browse through). This Christmas was the first time the gift giver looked at me and said, ""I know you like your books, but could you do a little lighter reading next Christmas?"" Get it? ""Lighter"" reading? Because the book itself weighs like 10 pounds. Oh well. The Weasley twins would have found it funny.Anyway, the book itself is magnificent, really. It has all the inside info. and tidbits I was hoping would be included with the blu-rays and DVDs. Since the ""deluxe"" movie box-set featuring all the good stuff like cast and director commentaries, etc. isn't going to be released until next October or November, this, along with the blu-ray collection of the 8 films, is as good as you're able to get right now if you're into all the ""extras"" behind the films you love to watch.The book is PACKED with pictures, many of them never-before-seen by the public. And while much info. is regurgitated from the handful of extras we did get with our DVDs, there is definitely something new for every Harry Potter film fan to discover around nearly every corner.Is this book perfect? No. There are a couple of problems with it that stop the book from reaching perfection: 1. The pages come loose from their binding too easily. I've only read through about 30% of the book, and I'd say the bottom left corner of at least 10 pages has already ripped off and away from the binding. Very disappointing. 2. Too much of this feels like promotional material. You aren't given any insight into on set quarrels, etc. If you've ever read a press release that is sent to film critics, you'll know what you're getting. But you're getting hundreds and hundreds of pages of it, instead of 25 or 30. As huge as it is, this book certainly isn't a ""tell all"" in any form or fashion. A little ""behind the behind the scenes"" from Rita Skeeter would have been welcome.The bottom line? If you're a fan of the Harry Potter series, you're going to be a fan of this book. Even with the complaints listed above, I was thrilled to receive this as a gift and am proud to display it for company. Also, it's the very first Harry Potter related book heavy enough to help develop muscles just by holding it up to read it.

"The first thing that must be said about Rage is that the Artificial Intelligence (AI) is unparalleled in the gaming universe. You will see things in this game you never would have thought you'd see until at least the next generation of consoles. Enemies will group together to gang up on you, will split up to flank you, will run for cover if out in the open and will actually run away from you if it's the best option (just to name a handful of the awesomeness you'll see unfold before your very eyes by the time the game is over). Rage is the first game where, when playing offline, you feel like you're playing actual human beings online. The AI is that intelligent. And for that alone, this game gets a 4 out of 5.Sadly, the second thing that must be said about Rage is that it doesn't live up to the hype. It doesn't even resemble the hype. A game that was said to be 18-25 hours long (in a much ballyhooed release to the press) can be finished in less than 10 (12-15 if you engage in the sidequests and are into collecting items). A game that was said to revolutionize shooters is essentially just another shooter -- and one that could easily be seen as a sequel to Borderlands, its gameplay style is so similar (EDIT: Rage was in production prior to Borderlands and reading a preview from 2006, it seems Borderlands got its ideas from Rage -- not the other way around!). A game that was said to have graphics that would be unmatched has texture pop-in and screen-tear on a regular basis (that said, it's still pretty incredible, considering it's running at 60FPS).""Potential"" sums up Rage better than any other word in the English dictionary (""disappointing"" would be a close second). It never lives up to said potential, but it shows it from beginning to nearly the end and oftentimes comes close enough to its potential to keep you playing and keep you having fun. It shows what AI is capable of -- not in the future, but right now. Today. On a console you already own. It also shows what happens when a production is too rushed or a developer reaches too high.So is Rage a great tech demo and a bad game, or a great game with advanced tech that's not quite ready for prime-time?

"This is probably the weakest entry in the Disney canon that was released during Walt's lifetime. That's not to say the movie doesn't have its moments. It certainly does. But, as one of the animators said, explaining the lack of quality of this film, there were ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" (the movie had 5 directors). Walt stepped back on this one and let his animators take control. It didn't help that he kept the film relatively low-budget.So what you have is a series of vignettes that somewhat match, but never feel entirely consistent. The only constant is Alice (whose facial features change throughout the movie) running after the White Rabbit. But the White Rabbit, in this film, is used as a MacGuffin. He drags our leading character from one animated short to another. All of them looking shamefully low-budget when compared to the likes of Pinocchio. I don't want to spoil the film, so I'll just say every 10 minutes or so the movie changes focus.Some may appreciate the lack of focus and the dreamlike quality, which I can fully understand. It does lend itself to the surrealistic dreamworld Alice has somewhat accidentally entered. But had Walt taken a far more active interest in this movie and upped its budget by a couple million, I feel we'd have a far better movie with a much, much stronger narrative.So is Alice a loss? No. There are plenty of entertaining scenes. The animation, while clearly of a lesser budget than Pinocchio, Snow White, Fantasia or Bambi still has moments than stun the viewer. The blu-ray transfer is as crisp and colorful as it most likely can get. Even if you're not entirely impressed with the animation, you will be impressed with the glorious transfer.But rather than enjoy the movie that Alice in Wonderland is, I can't help but long for the movie it could have been. Had it been Walt's first animated full-length (as initially intended), it surely would have been more focused, with a larger budget and a story that kept the audience compelled as it propelled them forward. As it is, it's a decent series of oddities and adventures that never quite come together to make a satisfying whole.Would I recommend it? If you're a diehard Disney fan, absolutely. But if you're only a casual fan of animation, I may recommend holding back. Fun though it may be, with all the great films Walt Disney produced, this one comes off as the weakest link.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P6AN7SRMOSG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049GYXDG#wasThisHelpful","R3P6AN7SRMOSG2","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bright colors, a nice sheen of film grain that makes you feel as though you're at the theater. This movie looks GOOD. I was leery of purchasing this blu-ray after already owning the 25th (or was it 30th?) anniversary DVD. There are duplicate extras (which is good for those who only own the Blu), but a few fun new extras are included.The highpoint is the interactive feature where you can throw ""virtual"" rice, etc. at the screen. This is especially good for Rocky Horror virgins getting prepared to see the movie as it was meant to be seen -- at a theater with a big audience of fellow freaks and geeks. If you haven't watched Rocky Horror with a live audience, you haven't watched Rocky Horror.I was disappointed that no new commentary tracks were included -- It's been ten years, someone must have had something more to add. That complaint aside, this movie looks GOOD (did I mention that already?). I honestly never thought I'd see Rocky Horror look THIS good THIS late in the game. The film is beautiful. The songs sound better than ever. And Rocky. Oh, Rocky!I'd recommend this to any fan of the film. And remember, ""Stay sane inside insanity.""

"This is a genuine review. One that I refused to write until I watched all 6 blu-ray movies (with my girlfriend -- more on that later), all deleted scenes, listened to 8 of the 12 commentaries and sampled the other 4. In other words, this review is -- unlike so many 1 star reviews written prior to the release of this collection that were based on rumors and the person doing the critique's imagination -- REAL.All changes and alterations will be noted, for better or for worse, so you can decide if this collection is for you. Also, for the alterations/changes, I'm adding THE GIRLFRIEND TEST (she likes the movies, but never ""loved"" them) and THE FANBOY TEST (I have seen all 3 sequels at least a hundred times and the prequels at least 15 times each). Now - onto the reviews ...PHANTOM MENACE Review:I debated going in the order the series was filmed, but I've never watched them in chronological order so figured I'd take a chance. The Phantom Menace has went from a beloved Star Wars' film in most fanboy eyes (""Not as good as A New Hope and Empire, but better than Return of the Jedi"" was the common refrain) to the most hated of the prequels. The movie definitely isn't all that it could be. It isn't even close. But it has the best lightsaber battle of the trilogy, an awesome opening sequence, and WAY less Jar Jar than you remember (it's just that he's so SHRILL whenever he appears). It's also the only Star Wars' prequel that FEELS like Star Wars. It has plenty of real sets and is structured much like the original 3.The Movie Itself: 7 out of 10PHANTOM MENACE Picture Quality:The picture quality of The Phantom Menace is the worst of the bunch. It's filled with TONS of annoying Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) leading to a LOT of clayface. And even with that, the digital FX are still much sharper than the filmed shots of actors (this was the last Star Wars' film to actually be shot on film), which leads to the actors oftentimes looking out-of-focus or ""blurred"" when compared to their annoying digital counterparts. This one still needs a lot of work, and I'm sure that was what George intended -- as he wants to sell us this set all over again in 7-10 years. In 3D.Picture Quality: 6 out of 10 (still WAY better than the DVD)PHANTOM MENACE Sound Quality:The sound in the film is INCREDIBLE. It is some of the best surround sound ever produced on blu-ray. It genuinely sounds better than the the theatrical version. The Pod Race is, in my opinion, the best sounding segment of film ever put on a blu-ray disc.Sound Quality: 10 out of 10PHANTOM MENACE 2011 changes:The horrible cross-eyed, stoned looking Yoda puppet has been changed to CG.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: Yes, she noticed. Yes, she liked it better.THE FANBOY TEST: Yes, I noticed. Yes, I liked it better.The HORRIBLE FX when Obi and Qui run away from the droid destroyers down the hall where you could see THROUGH them (Obi and Qui) is removed.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: No, she didn't notice. Yes, when compared to the DVD she liked it better.THE FANBOY TEST: No contest. It is a GREAT improvement.ATTACK OF THE CLONES Review:Attack of the Clones has always been -- prior to this blu-ray release -- my least favorite of the 6 movies in the saga. This release won me over. The movie is the best paced of the prequel trilogy and second to Empire Strikes Back in pacing, overall. The downfall is the HIDEOUS ""romantic"" dialogue between Anakin and Padme. What a load of garbage. It's still as laughable and as intolerable as it was at the midnight screening a decade ago. Fortunately, the rest of the movie holds up very well. This is the best directing Lucas has done since A New Hope (aside from his poor direction of actors). It moves at a brisk pace and keeps the viewer involved from start to finish.The Movie Itself: 8 out of 10ATTACK OF THE CLONES Picture Quality:Sadly, the movie suffers from the same DNR as Phantom Menace. As it was shot digitally, it isn't as glaring, but there are a few moments of waxy-face that are nearly intolerable. On the other hand, the CG in the movie has never looked better. The end battle (which is essentially one big cartoon) has some breathtaking moments.Picture Quality: 7 out of 10ATTACK OF THE CLONES Sound Quality:Incredible. Amazing. Ear-shatteringly awesome! Every bit as great as Phantom Menace. If TPM and AoTC lived up to their soundtracks, they'd be the best movies ever!Sound Quality: 10 out of 10ATTACK OF THE CLONES 2011 Changes:Anakin hears junk (such as his mother) while he's dreaming -- indicating it's a terrifying dream, instead of a wet one.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: No, she didn't notice. No, she didn't care.THE FANBOY TEST: I noticed something was different, but not exactly what (which led me to look it up). It did make the scene slightly less humiliating to watch.REVENGE OF THE SITH Review:Revenge of the Sith is a bleak film. If you're a diehard fan, it comes close to being traumatic. Lucas didn't sell this one short. Not at all. Sure, it should have been at least 3 hours and expanded further on Anakin's change to the Dark Side. That said -- the Emperor thought he could change Luke in a matter of seconds in Return of the Jedi. So at least it makes a bit more of an effort. The opening space battle is incredible. The banter from the original trilogy is back and nearly lives up to its predecessors. This is a very good movie. It still suffers from some of the inane ""romantic"" dialogue between Anakin and his lover, but Star Wars' fans have learned to deal with some cheesiness. Honestly -- no SW film, like no pizza (at least no good pizza), is without cheese -- not even Empire.The Movie Itself: 10 out of 10REVENGE OF THE SITH Picture Quality:Unlike the first 2 DNR destroyed prequels, Revenge of the Sith looks GREAT! As a matter of fact, it's the best looking of all 6 films. The opening space battle is right up there with Avatar and Planet Earth as the best looking thing you'll ever see on blu-ray. This movie is, visually, reference quality. If you're proud of your set up and don't own this film, you no longer have a reason to be proud.Picture Quality: 10 out of 10REVENGE OF THE SITH Sound Quality:I guess -- if you're a Star Wars' fan -- you can't have it all. This mix is muddled and doesn't sound nearly as good as the other 5. Still -- they set a very high standard and RoTS definitely impressive.Sound Quality: 8 out of 10REVENGE OF THE SITH 2011 Changes:I noticed none.A NEW HOPE Review:What can be said that hasn't been said already? A New Hope introduced us to this crazy universe. It was like nothing we had ever seen. It was Flash Gordon for a new generation. It was pure amazement. It literally defined the word ""entertainment"" and, because of that, lines of geeks and non-geeks surrounded every theater playing the film. Aside from the dated 70s looking computers (which is a change I wish George Lucas WOULD make) and a few clunky lines from the actors (mainly Mark Hammill), the movie is pure perfection.The Movie Itself: 10 out of 10A NEW HOPE Picture Quality:There's quite a bit of DNR toward the beginning -- especially on Princess Leia's face, but it lessens throughout. There's also some terrible dirt during the Tatooine scenes and a few blurry looking shots. That said, the film looks GOOD. Almost too good. Better than I thought I'd ever see a movie this dated appear.Picture Quality: 9 out of 10A NEW HOPE Sound Quality:Picks up right where Attack of the Clones left off (Sith was a misfire). The sound is so tremendous, you'll have trouble believing this movie was released in 1977. It sounds better than 99.9999999999% of movies released today!Sound Quality: 10 out of 10A NEW HOPE 2011 Changes:R2 hides behinds some CG rocks that look pretty real.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: No, she didn't notice. No, she didn't care.THE FANBOY TEST: I noticed and didn't care until the rocks suddenly vanished. Sorta lazy, Lucas.Luke's lightsaber is color corrected during his training.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: No, she didn't notice. No, she didn't care.THE FANBOY TEST: I noticed (because I was LOOKING for it) and was happy Lucas corrected the error.EMPIRE STRIKES BACK Review:As a fan of film and a fan of ""event"" films, I believe Empire Strikes Back to be the BEST event film ever made (along with Raiders of the Lost Ark). It is absolutely perfect, from beginning to end and, frankly, my favorite movie of all time. 'Nuff said.The Movie Itself: 10 out of 10EMPIRE STRIKES BACK Picture Quality:Best it's ever looked. Yes, there's some grain in the scenes on Hoth, but at least the scenes on Hoth are WHITE again -- instead of blue! Not quite reference quality, but VERY close.Picture Quality: 9 out of 10EMPIRE STRIKES BACK Sound Quality:Let me just repeat what I said for the other ones and double it: Incredible. Amazing. Ear-shatteringly awesome! Wait 'til Han flies you into the asteroid field!Sound Quality: 10 out of 10EMPIRE STRIKES BACK 2011 Changes:Can't see the puppeteer's hand on the Wampa anymore.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: No, she didn't notice. No, she didn't care.THE FANBOY TEST: I noticed because I read about it and I didn't really care.The whole scene in Cloud City with Chewie retrieving 3PO has been color corrected and sparks have been added.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: No, she didn't notice. Yes, she cared a little bit when I compared the two.THE FANBOY TEST: I noticed and cared. It looks a LOT better, now.RETURN OF THE JEDI Review:This is the suckiest of the original 3 films. In a lot of ways, this is the worst Star Wars' film ever made. Yes, there is an awesome puppet creation in Jabba the Hutt, but it also has teddy-bears destroying the Empire. It's ridiculous. Han Solo acts like he's been brain-damaged by the carbonite. Luke isn't as much of a Jedi as he is Luke who we're told is a Jedi. The ""sister"" angle is wedged in and embarrassing. The premise of being told you HAVE to DESTROY Vader and yet being told you'll turn to the Dark Side if you strike him down is pure insanity. Another Death Star with basically the same exact weakness is silly and shameful. C3PO being this great storyteller after claiming he's not very good at telling stories in A New Hope is lazy or ignorant. This movie was George just wanting to get his ""9 part"" saga over in 3 sections. I'm sorry if your child blinders are blinding you, but this is, hands down, the junkiest of the Star Wars' films. It makes all 3 prequels look like Citizen Kane. Complaining aside, it does have an AMAZING space battle and a pretty groovy speeder bike chase through Endor.The Movie Itself: 7 out of 10RETURN OF THE JEDI Picture Quality:The picture quality of Return of the Jedi is second only to Revenge of the Sith. There's less DNR than in any of the other 5 and it really does look like it did on the big screen. If not for the large amount of uncleaned grain during the Tatooine scenes, I'd say it looked better than it did theatrically.Picture Quality: 10 out of 10RETURN OF THE JEDI Sound Quality:Like every movie in this box, excluding Sith, the sound is as good as modern technology gets.Sound Quality: 10 out of 10RETURN OF THE JEDI 2011 changes:Jabba's palace has a bigger door made of CG.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: No, she didn't notice. When I showed her the DVD, she liked the new version better.THE FANBOY TEST: Yes, I noticed. I liked both about the same.Han thawing from carbonite is slightly different (through CG).THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: Yes, amazingly, she noticed. She liked it ""way"" better.THE FANBOY TEST: I noticed. I thought it was a little cheesy, but was fine with the change.A Dug is added to one scene, but takes away from nothing.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: She didn't notice or care.THE FANBOY TEST: I noticed and thought it was awesome. Perfect tie-in to the original trilogy. Just wish they made it look SLIGHTLY less CG.Ewoks have blinking CG eyes.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: She didn't notice, but when I showed her the older version she thought the new one was ""10 times better!""THE FANBOY TEST: I noticed immediately and thought the new version was, let's say, 3 times better.R2D2's attack is now over-the-top CG.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: She didn't notice. When I compared, she didn't care.THE FANBOY TEST: I HATED this change. It looked fake and I can't think of a single reason why they changed it. It sucked.Darth Vader says ""No"" and then says, ""Noooo."" Contrary to rumor, he never screams ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOO"" like he did in Revenge of the Sith.THE GIRLFRIEND TEST: She noticed. She didn't care.THE FANBOY TEST: I noticed and, to be honest, didn't really care. It's tactfully done. It doesn't take away the silent moments where we see Vader, just through his eyes, starting to hate the Emperor and sympathize with his son. It ties together well with the original and if you're whining about this by writing a fake 1 star review before even watching the blu-ray, you need to get a life.EXTRAS:Awesome. But I won't give them a 5 out of 5, as they should have included ALL deleted scenes and ALL extras from the DVD releases AND the blu-ray releases (this is George's greedy way of making us all hang onto our DVDs instead of selling them used). Billionaire George is into making billions more. Still, this is the best set of extras the Star Wars' saga has ever had. By far.Overall? This is easily the best Star Wars' release ever. This is an event. If you want to deny yourself the pleasure of owning this treasure because the original versions aren't included, I more than understand. But, if you are a huge fan of the saga AND writing a 1 star review before even seeing the blu-rays, you are both lying to your audience and denying yourself to the point of being pathetic. May the force be with you. Always.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP60AKXJ9FMHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZSJ212#wasThisHelpful","RP60AKXJ9FMHW","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since Lions Gate has been mum on the details/specs of this set, never even issuing a press release containing any info., I thought I'd take this opportunity to answer many of the unanswered questions for those who have yet to order:1. The 3 movies are the exact same blu-rays that were released separately. Right down to the now dated ads and trailers that you cannot skip past. Same extra features (not many), same picture, same everything -- outside of the discs themselves which are all that generic grey ""rental"" version looking disc with no individual artwork. There is, as expected, NO director's cut of the original film included.2. The 2 documentaries are on 1 disc, despite this being labeled as a 5 disc set when I (and many others) ordered it.3. The 2 documentaries are in partial HD. ""Scream: The Inside Story"" goes between 1080i, 720p and 480p. The only parts in 480p are clips of the actual Scream movies. The rest, for unknown reasons (I suspect a glitch on the discs or a way to cram both docs onto one disc) jumps between 720p and, rarely, 1080p. If your blu-ray player upconverts, the only real noticeable changes are the film clips in ""Scream: The Inside Story"" being of significantly lesser quality. ""Still Screaming"" fares a little better with the film clips also being in HD.4. Despite Lions Gate's website claiming the documentaries contain 4 hours of extras, including commentaries, etc. -- there are NO extras. The docs play in DTS Master Audio Stereo. The menu is static with the only options being to choose which documentary you want to play. Even if you are in the middle of watching one of the docs, it will start at the beginning if you even accidentally hit the stop button. There isn't a bookmark option and, most surprisingly, there ISN'T CLOSED CAPTIONING ON EITHER DOCUMENTARY. I think that is very important to note for those hard of hearing. It's an inexcusable omission.5. The movies are just as you left them. Scream is an excellent little horror film. Scream 2 is a decent, somewhat drawn out sequel. Scream 3 is still an embarrassment (seriously, what are Jay and Silent Bob doing in this thing?). The movies DO have closed captioning available. Just not the docs.6. The whole thing comes in one normally sized Blu-Ray case with a cardboard overlay. The 4th disc was warped over the 3rd disc in mine, which hasn't seemed to cause any problems, but was distressing when I first opened the package. The cardboard overlay and case itself have the same art as you see displayed at the top of this page.7. I have just noticed Lions Gate removed the ""5 film set"" from their webpage entirely and replaced it with ""Scream 1-3 Gift Set."" The 5 film set was there as recently as Saturday. Maybe they didn't want to be seen falsely advertising the multiple hours of extras the documentaries included (which, as I mentioned above, aren't there).Overall, I'm disappointed with this package. And I can see why Lions Gate did everything to HIDE the details from the general audience. If you like the Scream movies and don't yet own them, this is the best way to buy them as it's cheaper than it is to buy them individually (if you want all 3) and you get the two docs (as poorly presented as they are). If you already own the movies? I'd pass on this. Clearly there ARE extras out there for the docs and I suspect they'll sell the documentaries separately -- probably for under 10 bucks -- with closed captioning and all the extras included. The docs themselves, as bare-boned as they are, just aren't worth 20 bucks, if you already own the films.I hope this review helped anyone on the fence make an educated decision as to whether or not the 4 disc collection is worth it for them. Thanks for reading!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVHBX07TPVZ1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057YUV6C#wasThisHelpful","RVHBX07TPVZ1X","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cursed Mountain is an even mix between Resident Evil 4 and Fatal Frame 2. Despite it not being as good as either of the two classic games that inspired it; survival horror fans should know that it took its inspiration from the best and is still bound to be a very good game. And a very good game it is.Cursed Mountain is second only to Dead Space as this generation's best survival horror title. Unlike Resident Evil 5 -- which ended up being more of a co-op action/adventure game, rather than horror -- Cursed Mountain proudly sticks with the spooky from beginning to end. While there is plenty of confrontations with ghosts, ghouls, heights and unbearable weather conditions, the game isn't trying to outdo Call of Duty or Killzone 3 in the action department.The game works in spite of the Wii, not because of it. The only real limitations Cursed Mountain shows is the amount of enemies on screen at once, passable graphics that are very much ""last-gen,"" and some irritating motion control that never quite works right. But if you play a lot of games on the Wii, you know that, with rare exception, these problems hinder all Wii games. I debated docking a point due to the control issues, but don't think it's fair to punish an otherwise quality game due to the limited power it had to work with.If you like motion controls, Cursed Mountain does put them to good use. When you've just about defeated an evil spirit, a red circle appears on its chest. You point the Wiimote at the circle, press the A button and are asked to perform a series of gestures with your motion control to finish the meanie off (and gain a little health in the process). This would be fine, except for the fact that about 20% of the time the controller reads your gesture wrong and you have to start all over again. This is only really annoying during a boss fight or fight with multiple enemies that then has to be replayed if your character dies.The fixes that could have been made by the developers are few, but they definitely should have been addressed. The controls are clunky (very similar to RE4) and borrowing a few ideas from Dead Space, which modernized and revolutionized control schemes and HUDs for survival horror titles, wouldn't have been a bad idea. The other thing -- which is the biggest problem of the game -- is that auto-saves continually save BEFORE fights with multiple baddies and BEFORE lengthy cutscenes. This seems totally unnecessary and does slow the game down quite a bit. Then again, it pushed my total gameplay time to 10 hours and 4 minutes, which does end up giving the feel of a better value, despite at least an hour of that being padding.Complaints aside, I gave Cursed Mountain a 4 out of 5 for a reason. The game has great atmosphere. A soundtrack that is truly eerie and adds to the tension throughout. Some scares (not enough, but what's there oftentimes works). An interesting, mature plot. And it does it all without giving into the temptation most ""survival horror"" games have (again, see RE5 as a great example) to add co-op and up the action while diminishing the horror and suspense.Cursed Mountain is an overlooked gem of a game for the Wii. It came out as an exclusive (it has since been released as a downloadable PC game) and sold so poorly that many people who would have loved it obviously ended up missing it entirely. If this is your kind of game (and if you're a fan of RE4 and Fatal Frame 2, this IS your kind of game), it's not to late to pick a copy up.

"I'm a diehard gamer, but found myself irritated with the terrible movies that first introduced much of the public to the Pokemon craze (I actually saw the second one at the theater, to see what all the hype was about).

But I can't see the practicality of paying even an extra 2 dollars over the price of a cable that, for all intents and purposes, performs every bit as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY0ZMUKFMXKOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FSTBF4#wasThisHelpful","RY0ZMUKFMXKOQ","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a huge fan of Billy Joel for decades now (when you're listing things in ""decades"" you know you're getting old) and couldn't wait to get this CD/DVD combo. I have to admit to being a little disappointed. The songs don't stray far from the studio versions, other than Billy's voice being deeper (he still sounds good, though) and the music being slightly slowed down to accommodate.Billy's lost a lot of energy with age (as do we all), but what's more surprising is that his audience also seems to be slightly tired. Joel himself looks surprised at the lack of cheering he hears at the start. His more rock and roll oriented hits are mostly missing, leaving this as a 2 hour set consisting of almost all ballads.I think the set also suffers from his not having made any new music in almost 2 decades and from Joel playing it safe with the songs he chooses to play. There's nothing new here, aside from guest appearances, that you couldn't find on his older, better live albums. Or that you couldn't hear attending basically any of his recent, overpriced concerts with Elton John. Also, much of Joel's trademark banter with the audience has been unwisely removed. It would have added something new to the discs.Shea's final concert was a significant cultural event and this CD/DVD would be great for those who were there to commemorate the experience. But for those of us who missed out when it was live? It wouldn't be the end of the world to skip this one and keep holding out for a new studio album from Billy Joel.As far as the quality? The CDs sound great. Great mix and well edited (outside of It's Still Rock and Roll being edited out completely). The problem is the 5.1 mix on the DVD. The bass is mixed way too low. It's literally almost impossible to hear. When I cranked my subwoofer up I did get some bass, but it's still pretty limited.I love a lot of these songs, so can't really give this less than a 3 out of 5. I also loved the Shea, so feel sort of obligated to give at least a 3 out of 5. That said, I could have found better things to spend my ten dollars on and don't think I would have bought this had I heard it prior to making the purchase. Although Paul McCartney's appearance almost makes it worth the price, alone.PS - Whatever idiot decided to remove It's Still Rock and Roll To Me (which was performed live at Shea) from both the CDs and DVDs shouldn't be allowed to work in the music industry ever again.

"I first bought a pack of 12 at $38. The price is now up by $30 to $68. This is insane and in no way does this fairly reflect the hike in gas prices. I could see a $5.00 raise ... maybe. But $30? These were $3.16 a can a year ago. They're now $5.67 a can. Any grocery store raising their prices that much, that fast, would be laughed out of business. This is is shameful. Get these prices in line, Amazon (or, if Worthington's responsible, get them to get their prices in line or drop the product).As far as the product? It was dropping in quality, anyway.

"I have now finished the single-player campaign and spent over 10 hours playing online multiplayer (all modes). I played through the campaign using the Move controller. I played through part of the campaign again using the standard controller. I played through the entire campaign in 3D and through part of it in 2D, to compare.So I've pretty much blown every whistle and rung every bell Sony's including with this game (the only thing I haven't tried is the offline co-op). Here's what I thought of the entire thing:The Good:Online Multiplayer. It's incredibly fun. Using the Move controller gives you better accuracy, which usually lands me in first or second place. It almost feels like cheating, but this is the direction Sony took.Single player campaign. Ignore the bitter critics who are crying because they didn't get a chance to play it in 3D or they're rendered incapable of praising any FPS that doesn't star Master Chief or have someone Calling for Duty. This is in the top 10 best FPS titles ever made. Its set-pieces are similar to early Lucas or Spielberg movies in how EPIC they are. Think Raiders of the Lost Ark or any of the first 3 Star Wars' films. It's a really well put together game with more jaw-dropping moments than the last 3 Halos combined.The Move Controls. They work better than you could imagine. They work better than the dualshock itself. It's the closest you're going to come to the keyboard/mouse experience on a console, without literally using a keyboard and mouse on a console. Very accurate. Very fun to play.The graphics. Pure awesomeness. Thought Killzone 2 looked good? This one looks better.The Bad:As much as I loved it, the campaign is way too short (7 hours to finish on medium difficulty) and may be just a little too disjointed. There were a few times where they went overboard making scenes that would stand out in 3D and leave 2D gamers scratching their heads. If the single-player campaign ran 10-20 hours, I would have given Killzone 3 a 5 out of 5. I'm sure they'll have more of the game to sell us later (there's a ""6 months later"" moment that feels created for DLC).Lack of maps. I'm not sure how many maps the game comes with, but with 10+ hours of play time, I haven't seen more than 6 or 7. Not to mention, everyone memorizes one map and then keeps voting to play it over and over again, which is really annoying. Again, I'm sure they'll have plenty more maps to sell us later as DLC. Am I the only one noticing that to get a ""full"" game, you have to shell out around $120? Seems like sort of a scam.The Ugly ... er ... ""Helghast"":The 3D. The 3D worked well enough. Some parts were worthy of pure amazement. One section had me screaming out to my girlfriend, ""Now THIS is what 3D gaming's about!"" Then I felt like a geek. A geek wearing $100 3D glasses. Thinking back on it, it's hard to believe she's stayed with me this long.The problem with the 3D is the nonstop crosstalk (it's worse in darker areas and cutscenes). If you're not all that familiar with 3D, crosstalk basically looks like you're having double (or even triple) vision. This can be pretty problematic when you're staring at three crosshairs, when there's only supposed to be one. I just kept the, ""hit the one in the middle"" line from Rocky IV in mind. It's the worst crosstalk I've seen in a game or in a movie. Which sucks, because, had it not been wrecked by the crosstalk, it would have easily been the best 3D ever put into a game.That said, if you have the chance, I'd recommend playing in 3D. At least a few of the scenes (feel free to ask me in the comments, which parts work best in 3D -- I don't want to give away spoilers in this review). But for all the 3D hype, the game looks and plays just fine in 2D. I wouldn't invest in that 3DTV just yet -- at least not if you're doing so just for this game. On the other hand, I'd definitely invest in this game. If you're a fan of shooters; you won't be disappointed!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZT075FKTR25G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0K6DG#wasThisHelpful","R2ZT075FKTR25G","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the original Donkey Kong Country remains in my top three side-scrolling platformers ever made, I held off buying this game. I had been burned by the ""nostalgia bug"" one too many times. Platformers that sort of look and kind of play like those from the SNES/Genesis glory days. I wasn't going to be burned again by a semi-remake designed by fools who had no clue. Had my brother not given me this as an early Christmas gift, I would never have played it. I was that tired of this virus filed under ""nostalgia.""But my brother did give me this game as an early Christmas gift, and, like Scrooge himself (not the scary looking Jim Carrey version) buying the largest turkey known to man, my heart melted. Why? Because Donkey Kong Country Returns IS a GENUINE sequel. It's not going for nostalgia (although nostalgia's inevitable for old-school gamers), it's going for a sequel that equals the first couple of games. Nostalgia's merely a side effect.This game, as they say, ""has it all."" But this game never, for one second, feels like it was going through the motions to earn it all. It just feels like the next side-scrolling DK game. Does it live up to the first 2 Donkey Kong Country titles created by Rare? Oh yes! In a lot of ways, it's better. Donkey Kong Country Returns FINALLY takes 2-D platforming into the next generation.It earns its right to be a Donkey Kong Country game, rather than earning a fast buck by ripping off the Donkey Kong Country community, holding out their wallets. It earns the title of the next official DKC title. A 10-year-old could pick this one up and love it from beginning to end, without ever playing another DKC release. That can't be said for many of the nostalgia cash-ins that have been shoved down our throats since platformers made a comeback on handheld systems.I do have a few complaints. The ridiculous motion-control takes away some of the accuracy needed in a platformer. When you meet up with the shielded crabs, you'll know just how obnoxious this can be. DKCR absolutely should have been allowed to be played on a GameCube or Classic controller. It seemed, quite literally, designed for that purpose.Still, you do get used to the motion control and motion control has turned into a necessary evil of the Wii. Without it, would a new Donkey Kong Country been given to us? Especially one this magnificent? Doubtful. So you take the superb with the mildly annoying.DKCR's graphics suffer slightly from the Wii hardware, but, with 480p turned on, the game still manages to truly look beautiful. I have no problem stating that this is the best looking game on the Wii. I'd be surprised if anything manages to beat it, prior to the WiiHD being released. Is it at the level of a PS3 Killzone or a 360 Gears of War? Of course not. But does it do the job -- and then some? Absolutely! This game will not embarrass you visually. Period. It has a ""wow"" factor never before seen on the Wii. And that's coming from someone playing on a 65"" 1080p television screen.The biggest downfall of the game isn't its graphics, but its two-player mode. It's sort of a pain. But the earlier DKC didn't even provide 2-player support, so it's a nice bonus. Two-player has been much improved on DKCR when compared to New Super Mario Bros. Wii, so if you were happy with that, you'll be even happier with this. I'd still recommend single-player, though, if you're a serious gamer looking for hardcore platforming and scores worth bragging about.Donkey Kong Country Returns is one of the best games of 2010. There just aren't many games on any console that are as fun as this one. It will have you smiling from beginning to end. It is an honorable successor to the first two Donkey Kong Country games and it absolutely demolishes Rare's final attempt at the franchise with their 3-D ""upgrade"" on the Nintendo 64. If you're a DKC fan, this is the game you've been waiting for!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0NWEYYJP5YU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZHMMEM#wasThisHelpful","R3O0NWEYYJP5YU","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I kept reading 1 star reviews hating on this release because you had to flip the disc in the middle of the movie. I had watched the extended version of the film and was never asked to flip the disc. I finally figured out that Amazon is including the DVD reviews (mostly 1 star) along with the Blu-Ray reviews (usually 4 or 5 stars). This seems like a bad mistake, as it drags down the overall rating on the Blu-Ray release.As far as the release itself? It's pretty amazing. It's nearly everything the original release should have been. I'm docking a star, because the studio clearly held back on including James Cameron's commentary track and on a 3-D version of the film. So, if you CAN wait another 8 or 9 months, I'd recommend doing so to get the definitive edition of this movie. It bugs me that they kept Cameron's commentary off as further incentive to buy a THIRD version of this Blu-Ray.Anyway, I ended up buying this version. I guess I'll just have to miss Cameron's commentary, because I'm not buying this again. I'm happy, overall, with the release. There ARE a LOT of extras included. I've only gotten through about half of them. I also think the extended edition of the film is an improvement, as it adds quite a bit to Sigourney Weaver's character arc. And it gives you more of an idea of the polluted conditions on earth (right down to people having to wear oxygen masks to breathe properly).Long story short? If you're okay with only owning the 2-D version of the movie and not having Cameron's commentary, this version fits the bill. If you'll end up unable to resist the next release, why not just wait and rent the movie until then? Hopefully, at that point, Amazon won't still be including DVD reviews in the Blu-Ray section.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MX8617PCFE5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044XV3QY#wasThisHelpful","R1MX8617PCFE5G","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was originally titled the ""sub-controller"" and that was much more fitting. Sony is somehow getting away with charging $30 for half a dual-shock. Only, it's not really half a dual-shock as it features NO RUMBLE. So, you're getting half a six-axis, right? NO. There is NO motion control feature included for your $30. This, to me, is the most disgusting thing about the Move setup, especially considering you REALLY DO need the navigational controller for games like RE5 and Heavy Rain (you can play with half a dual-shock, but it gets to be very uncomfortable very fast).I can almost guarantee Sony will add rumble to the navigational controller within the next 6 months (probably prior to the release of Killzone 3). So, if you're not a hardcore gamer, I'd wait. If you ARE and you REALLY want to use motion control on RE5 and Heavy Rain, I would recommend this, albeit reluctantly at this price.Is there anything wrong with the controller? Not really. It's well designed and mostly comfortable. The bumper button is too close to the thumbstick, which can lead to numb fingers and a sore wrist, but if you don't have large hands, this may not be a problem. Sony just needed to add either motion or rumble or both to justify this price. Nintendo charges $19.99 for their sub-controller (IE - ""nunchuck"") and it has motion control.The navigational controller would be priced right at $19.99 with rumble. Or at $9.99 as it currently is. Better yet, Sony could have included it in the starter pack and made everyone happy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S7GHJ4JVP9JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0K6X6#wasThisHelpful","R1S7GHJ4JVP9JO","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT (May 9th, 2011): With PSN being down for exactly 3 weeks now, the argument for including the content on the disc, instead of as DLC, is even stronger. If you bought this game 3 weeks ago, you'd still be without the DLC. If it would have been included ON THE DISC you could play away without worrying over whether or not you could get online.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Why isn't the DLC content ON THE DISC? Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition had voucher codes on the 360 because the content didn't fit on standard DVD. On the other hand, the PS3 version had the content on the disc, because Blu-Ray has much more capacity. Did you hear that, Gearbox? ON THE DISC.If this is 2K being greedy, well, they fail. I bought this, as I did RE5: Gold Edition. But the SECOND I realized the content wasn't ON DISC, I returned it for a full refund. You lose, 2K. And Gearbox loses along with you. I hope they appreciate your greed taking away their cut.Maybe you can release ANOTHER Game of the Year Edition. You could call it, ""The REAL Game of the Year Edition."" Or just call it the, ""We Apologize"" edition.The game itself is great, but I'll think twice about buying ANYTHING from 2K OR Gearbox after this fiasco. So will many others. I'm sick of publishers thinking THEY control the content WE buy. It's not supposed to work that way and hopefully enough gamers will stand their ground and avoid purchasing this garbage to ensure the consumer stops being scammed.Oh, and we have a RIGHT, under the law, to sell games used.

"Or somewhere close.The Kinect shows potential, but a single-player (and who wants to play this thing alone?) needs to stand back at least 9 feet. A two-player game? 14 feet MINIMUM. To paraphrase Jaws, ""We're gonna need a bigger room.""When I lugged my 360 & my Kinect down to my basement arcade, I admit I had semi-fun with the system (being semi-intoxicated may have helped). It isn't nearly as accurate as the Playstation Move, but it is more innovative. It's just that, I can't keep my 50"" plasma, my surround sound system and my 360 down in the basement. Which makes it useless. Unless I want to devote 100% of my entertainment time to Microsoft's latest gimmick.Unless Microsoft introduces a controller with buttons (which I suspect they'll do within the next half year), the Kinect is for casual gamers and casual gamers ONLY. The casual games, as far as casual games go, aren't bad. They're actually pretty fun. Not as enjoyable as Wii Sports Resort and not close to the accuracy or entertainment of Sony Move's Sports Champions. Still, there's a NOVELTY to these games that neither the Nintendo Wii or the Sony Move can provide.So, if you can afford it -- and if your house is at least the size of a bowling alley -- this may be worth your while. Especially if you don't mind sitting 77 feet away from the HDTV you invested so much into sitting close to to get the full benefit of 1080p.But if you're not super-rich, and if facial recognition isn't more important to you than quality gaming, the Kinect's not your thing. Unfortunately, MS took a high-end concept and ran with it. They didn't care about their devoted fans. They didn't care about gamers. But hey, they're currently bragging about personalizing advertisements on the console based on facial recognition.That counts for something right? Right?!? Either way, the Kinect is amusing for about 37 minutes. Hope that's enough for you to get your money's worth. If not, I guess you could argue with it by saying, ""Kinect, I am not pleased."" But it wouldn't understand you, which is typical.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJ94BPQRQQAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BSA298#wasThisHelpful","R3GJ94BPQRQQAP","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE INCLUDED GAME: This isn't my favorite motion-control game ever (that honor would probably go to Metroid Prime 3 or either of the Super Mario Galaxy titles), but it is hands down my favorite casual motion-control title. It is stunningly accurate. I've heard some complaints about table tennis. Table tennis is hands down my favorite sport in this game. As a semi-professional table tennis player, trust me -- it works accurately.Archery is also a blast. As is, strangely enough, Bocce -- a game I never had much fun with in real life. Another winner is the gladiator duel section of the game. This is the closest motion control has gotten to the 1:1 ""lightsaber"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" moment so many have wanted since the Wii was first announced as the ""Revolution.""The game isn't perfect. Using two controllers almost seems to be a marketing gimmick to get you to buy a second controller, even if you don't need one. While Gladiator is somewhat better with 2 controllers, archery works MUCH better with only one Move controller. Archery is twice as hard with two controllers.Complaints and quibbles aside, this really is a fine game. It's pretty much what we were promised by Nintendo with Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort. While fun, those games felt lacking. Sports Champions really is the perfect motion-control sport game. It just took it 5 years to finally arrive.THE CONTROLLER: It works fine for what it does and it's far more accurate than even the Wii Motion Plus, but $50.00 per Move wand is a lot to ask. Especially when the batteries run dry in less than 6 hours and take a good 4 to recharge. This is VERY annoying. I thought my first controller was broken, but the second Move controller I bought was charged for the same length of time and took just as long to recharge.The other problem with the Move controller is you need a decent sized living/gaming room. It's not as bad as the Kinect (to own a Kinect and properly use it, you must reside in a castle), but the Move needs a MINIMUM of 8 feet to work optimally for games. If the space between your furniture and your television isn't at least 8 feet, you're spending money on something that will not work properly on certain games (including some of the events in Sports Champions).THE PS3 EYE: Unless you're in a VERY well-lit room with LOTS of natural front-lighting (in other words, you only play during the day), your image will be grainy and full of colored splotches. This affects the game, because you are able to take photos ""holding"" a virtual bow, paddle, sword, etc. and, all the photos I've taken, have shown a barely visible grainy version of me holding the item. This makes them unusable (you're allowed to upload them to Facebook). Sony really needed to get this right prior to release.NAVIGATIONAL CONTROLLER (not included with the starter bundle): This was originally titled the ""sub-controller"" and that was much more fitting. Sony is somehow getting away with charging $30 for half a dual-shock. Only, it's not really half a dual-shock as it features NO RUMBLE. So, you're getting half a six-axis, right? NO. There is NO motion control feature included for your $30. This, to me, is the most disgusting thing about the Move setup, especially considering you REALLY DO need the navigational controller for games like RE5 and Heavy Rain. I guarantee Sony will add rumble to the navigational controller within the next 6 months. So, if you're not a hardcore gamer, I'd wait.OVERALL: I've spent a LOT of time with the Move, the Wii and the Kinect. If you want ONLY the most CASUAL as CASUAL gaming can be type games, the Kinect is your toy. It certainly has the more impressive technology. But, if you actually game because YOU enjoy GAMING, the MOVE is the motion-control item for you. Owning the Kinect, Move and the Wii, I feel safe saying the Move is the most accurate of the motion control controllers and also the happy medium between casual and hardcore games. The Move is the motion controller for everybody.I hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J3JNSAMS0EC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0J4NE#wasThisHelpful","R3J3JNSAMS0EC0","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Here's a tip that should solve any problem with the controls in table tennis: Make sure the Move controller has the Move button facing UP at all times. That's the way it's programmed to mimic an actual paddle. If you hold it any other way, it's similar to holding a ping pong paddle sideways and trying to hit the ball with the edge of the paddle. Once in the ""up"" position, you can add spin and anything else you would do in regular table tennis.

"I bought this Toshiba in 2005 and ended up moving out of the house after only using the television for a few months. So, I didn't have much time with the TV, but it made such an impact, here I am writing a review of the thing half a decade later.While I went from this TV to an EDTV to a full HDTV, none were as trouble-free as the Toshiba. Both the EDTV and HDTV I have owned since have provided a lot of headaches, along with the enhanced and high-definition viewing. The EDTV is already broken and the HDTV has never really worked all that well. Part of me wishes I would have just stuck with the 27"" Toshiba for five or six more years and waited for 3-D HDTV.This TV isn't lacking for an eye-popping picture. The color stream component DVD input is truly incredible for a standard-definition CRT. Never has a standard-definition picture looked this beautiful. I sold the television to my parents and they still use it daily. I was up visiting them last month and really felt nostalgic seeing the silver Toshiba of yesteryear. The last SDTV I'll ever own. And definitely the best.If you're looking for something cheap to stick in the dorm, or whatever, hunt one of these down. They are really good televisions sets. And you can find them used for less than fifty bucks and I notice there are a lot of them being sold (they're being replaced by HDTVs).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3F1JU25YFGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007WCA4K#wasThisHelpful","R2M3F1JU25YFGT","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have held off on writing this review until I knew that any review I wrote would be fair. After beating all 6 worlds, collecting 92 stars and over 40 comet coins, I'd say I have a pretty firm grip on the game. First of all, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is very, very fun to play. FUN takes precedent over any other comments, compliments or complaints I have in this review. Second, Super Mario Galaxy 2, contrary to popular opinion, is not harder than the first Super Mario Galaxy. If anything, it's easier.In the first SMG, which was also a pretty casual game by Mario standards (especially after the relatively brutal Super Mario Sunshine), I ended up getting frustrated with a couple levels and I gave up on trying to collect every star. After 3 years, I'm still sitting at 73 stars in total in the first game (I've gotten 20 more in the 2nd SMG ... in a single week). There wasn't a level, or boss, in SMG2 that was difficult to the point of frustration. The levels are very short and even the toughest won't last most gamers longer than 15 minutes (usually not more than 7 or 8).The most disappointing thing about the difficulty level is the ease of beating the bosses. Only 2 bosses in the game even killed Mario as I played. Not a single boss brought me to a game over. I beat the final boss without even getting hit. If only one thing changes for the next Mario, I hope it's the difficulty level of the bosses. Rosalina (IE - The ""Cosmic Guide"") offering more casual gamers a play-through affords Nintendo the chance to make bosses the like of which we haven't seen in at least half a decade. The kind of bosses that make you want to throw your controller through the TV set out of sheer aggravation.Outside of the bosses being too easy, does Super Mario Galaxy equal the first? It's even better! It loses the originality that the original had (obviously), but the level design is even more stunning. As mentioned above, levels are much shorter than those found in the other 3-D Mario games. Because of this, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is the first 3-D Mario to 100% successfully translate the pulse-pounding gameplay of the 2-D games of yesteryear into the 3-D visual style gamers crave today. The other 3-D Mario games were great -- but Galaxy 2 keeps the frantic energy level up from beginning to end in a way that I haven't seen since Super Mario World.Other advantages to Super Mario Galaxy 2 over the original Super Mario Galaxy (or any other 3-D platformer out today) are the return of Yoshi, a map that's the easiest to navigate since Super Mario World, slightly improved graphics, the ability to trade off and play as Luigi every few levels on the first play-through and some great new power-ups. For a game that I incorrectly thought was going to be nothing more than an expansion pack, these improvements were a welcome surprise.Despite the improvements, one downside from the first hangs around for the second. If you didn't like the controls in the original, they'll still annoy you in the sequel. I wish they'd allow you to play with your choice of motion-control, a GameCube or a classic controller like Smash Bros or Mario Kart. The precision of a gamepad is missed. I died from the spin control not registering at all or fast enough more often than I did from anything else in the game. These are cheap deaths that would be easily avoided with a gamepad.Even with the motion-control (or in spite of it), Mario Galaxy 2 is an excellent game. In the 18 hours it took me to collect 92 stars, never once did I get bored. There's always something new and exciting to see. The power-ups are scattered throughout and just when you tire of one, another is offered. The level design really does boggle the mind. You have to play it to understand how epic it truly is.Super Mario Galaxy 2 is the very essence of gaming. It, like all the best Mario games, is timeless. The game will be as fun 15 years from now as it is today. Super Mario Galaxy 2, just like Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World will be considered a classic when 2010's Call of Halo or Gears of Madden feels like an antique. And maybe in 15 years it will be available to play on a Virtual Console with a gamepad. Woo-hoo!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28Y3U4N1T0I48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BSA388#wasThisHelpful","R28Y3U4N1T0I48","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Josh Ritter is one of my favorite songwriters. I consider the one-two punch of The Animal Years and The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter to be a highpoint in music history. Only The Beatles released two albums as close together with two styles as different that still somehow worked so completely as companion pieces.So Runs the World Away is a victim of its superb predecessors as well as a victim of the duration between albums. While it took less than a year for The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter to follow The Animal Years, it took nearly 3 years for So Runs the World Away to follow The Historical Conquests.The time spent recording and writing the album has removed much of the spontaneity that was found in The Historical Conquests. Instead of 14 songs in 43 minutes we get 12 songs (plus a raucous, but brief, instrumental introduction) in 54 minutes. The songs suffer under the burden of their own length. Where The Historical Conquests was flighty and moved quickly from one song to the next without the listener knowing what to expect, So Runs the World Away moves slowly from one lumbering ballad to another, with only a couple songs having variety enough to break the tedium.This isn't a bad record, but it isn't a great one either. As a fan of Josh, I didn't want to review it until I heard it at least 10 times. Having now heard it over 20, there's still only a few songs that have broken through and that I've found myself humming throughout the day. This opposed to over half the songs on The Animal Years and literally all the songs on The Historical Conquests by the same amount of listens.Josh has concertedly moved away from the country, folksy twang that was found in his first 5 records, both instrumentally and vocally (lyrically, the album is a winner). With the exception of one song, So Runs the World Away is a straight up pop record, with a few dashes of folk (one song is derivative of Leonard Cohen, another of Bob Dylan). Most of this album sounds like Violent Femmes meets Bruce Springsteen, coming down from a coffee high. One tune, which is way out of left field, sounds like a b-side to an unreleased Tom Waits/Morphine hybrid single.It feels as though Josh wanted to remind people he was a ""serious"" artist by making sure nothing on the album was fun. That nothing crackled. That nothing felt alive. The album is perfect for play in Starbucks and for that reason I suspect it will outsell his past efforts. But it isn't close to the same level as his prior releases, especially the last two.The production value of So Runs the World Away has been upped even further from past releases and the songs have been layered with even more instruments to make sure you're still awake and still remembering what a serious artist he is, but he doesn't have you smiling this time. He doesn't have you clapping. And he doesn't have you singing his songs throughout the day, nearly unable to wait 'til you get back to a place where you can put them on and dance to them once again.Josh is known for dramatically changing his style from album to album, which is refreshing and, honestly, at this point, a relief. I do not want to hear another So Runs the World Away. I couldn't say the same for his last four efforts. Josh Ritter could do various spins on The Historical Conquests for the next 10 albums and I'd be more than satisfied. But we expect more from Josh and I am glad he did something new, despite being disappointed with how it turned out. I hope for the next album he uses The Historical Conquests as a launching pad into the next great musical experiment, rather than So Runs the World Away.In the meantime, there's enough on this album to make it worth listening to for the next year. Just don't make us wait as long for its follow-up, Josh. Maybe the world ran away with you over the last 3 years, but did your energy and ability to write a fun, catchy tune have to run away with it? I already have my tickets to see you in July when you play Orchestra Hall. Hopefully by that time you'll have a couple of new songs to debut from your next release. Songs that make the audience want to get up, dance in the aisles and celebrate all that is life. Because, truthfully, that is what you do best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TGN02P2VW4BO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003C5FMH6#wasThisHelpful","R1TGN02P2VW4BO","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Deadly Premonition is strictly a budget title as far as gameplay and graphics, the game excels when it comes to story, humor, characters and uniqueness. No one has ever played a game quite like this, unless they've played this game.Deadly Premonition took me 8 days to finish, which says something as the game took 21 hours to beat. I kept coming back to the title when I knew I should be doing something more productive.Deadly Premonition became a temporary obsession. When I was at work and couldn't play, I was thinking about detective work in the game. When I was out with friends, I was wondering what the characters in the game would do or say next. When I was in bed, thinking about the game literally kept me awake, wondering how long I could keep Agent York awake with the in-game coffee and food I had acquired.2 nights out of the 8 it took me to complete the main story, I stayed up all night and went to work the next day dead tired due to Deadly Premonition. Was it worth it? Surprisingly, yes. It actually has an ending that, in the context of the game, works. No, you won't confuse this for an AAA title. But if you don't have some of the most fun you've ever had playing a game, you may be confused.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD29405XX6WFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WSR8BC#wasThisHelpful","RD29405XX6WFQ","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a ""Constant Reader"" of Stephen King since picking up Cujo at far too young an age 20 some years ago and reading it from front to back in a couple of days. While I've never disliked a Stephen King novel, I have been disappointed by a number of them -- especially recently. Under the Dome brings King back to his glory days. This is the Stephen King who wrote the books I fell in love with as a 10-year-old boy -- so young I had to hide his books from my mom, who wouldn't allow me to read him.Stephen King hasn't written a book this good since IT. As a matter of fact, IT and THE STAND are probably the only 2 Stephen King books I still like more than I do Under the Dome. Yes, it really is THAT good. A huge cast of characters, a compelling plot and monsters that take shape in the form of politicians and their easily manipulated public. Sure, he's hinted at this stuff before, but in Under the Dome, he really lays it all out on the table.The story also addresses the threat faced by climate change and the damage that can be done should we choose to go on ignoring the reality of global warming. But why stop there? King manages to get some commentary in on torture, prejudice, U.S. military, police brutality, religious extremism (and religion as an excuse) and general corruption.But never does the book overwhelm with its message. Never does it feel like you're being preached at. This is, more than anything else, a fast and entertaining read from start to finish. A roller-coaster ride from beginning to end and, despite its length, one of the quickest reads going because you won't be able to put it down.Under the Dome is filled with murder, suspense, mystery and all those other fun things that keep you awake at night. And nobody this side of Edgar Allen Poe is as good as Stephen King is in bringing this stuff to life and embedding it into your nightmares. This is vintage King. Under the Dome is the best book of the year and one of the more enjoyable books of the decade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OUG4ZGFFXXI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439148503#wasThisHelpful","R2OUG4ZGFFXXI2","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first 20 - 30 minutes of Madworld are thrilling just for the novelty of it all, but then you realize nothing really changes, the boss battles are a bunch of context-sensitive events and the whole thing is over in about 4 hours. To be honest, they didn't even get the violence right. It's not clever enough to be funny, and too comical to be serious. I beat the game a day after buying it and sold it the day after that.So why a 3 out of 5 overall rating? Despite the obnoxious announcers who oftentimes repeat the same sentence 3 or more times in a row, the horrid soundmix and disappointing-for-a-rental gameplay length, there's something that Madworld has that many Wii games don't: Potential. At least the developers tried to make something a little different and they get an ""E"" for ""Effort"".The art direction is taken from Sin City and, for the most part, works. With a lot of fine tuning and initiative Madworld 2 could potentially turn into a good game. But as things are, the original Madworld is nothing more than a curiosity. An ""M"" rated game for the Wii. Although it isn't made for kids, it is, in many ways, more childish than whatever party game preceded it. Having looked forward to this game for a while now, I was very disappointed in its eventual gameplay.Here's hoping The Conduit finally gets it right. And gives us a great game that we can't complete in one sitting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GMULHQX2CQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019SY1D4#wasThisHelpful","R13GMULHQX2CQC","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Global Class War by Jeff Faux pulls no punches and takes no sides -- other than siding against NAFTA and the WTO. It's about the inner-workings of NAFTA and the WTO, filled with in-depth info. on how they came to be, who fought for them, who fought against them and ultimately how Bill Clinton got them passed with the same Dem House and Senate that had voted against NAFTA under Republican Presidents Reagan and Bush. It's an absolutely incredible book and the first and only book that I've read from front-to-back 3 times in less than 2 years. This one was missed by a lot of people -- most likely because it places blame on both Republican (Reagan, Bush and W. Bush) and Democratic heroes (primarily Clinton and Gore), thereby making it hard to find an audience of anyone in the partisan battle of political books. The last book that should be overlooked by anybody has somehow went unnoticed by nearly everybody, which is very sad and unfortunate. It's an amazing piece of work that was, quite amazingly, almost entirely missed and, if you're reading this now, add it to your cart.

"Lisey's Story isn't as great as some are saying and isn't as bad as others are claiming.  It's a good book.  Not an excellent book.  Not a horrible book.  It really is nothing more than what it's advertised as -- a love story with dark undercurrents.  Being that it's Stephen King behind the typewriter, those dark undercurrents are nearly black.  Horrific, even.It's hard to judge the book (as so many have) from the first 200 pages.  It takes its time to get to the ""action"" and lets you get to know the characters before it lets you know exactly what's wrong with the characters and why they behave the way that they do.  I welcome this, as it makes what happens in the second half of the book more disturbing and suspenseful.Lisey's Story is equal parts Dolores Claiborne, Gerald's Game and Rose Madder.  It could also be seen as Misery in reverse.  This time the author has the horrific history and his wife has to push her way through it.  But unlike Paul Sheldon, Lisey Landon does so voluntarily because she is in love with her husband -- blood bools and all.More than anything, this is the tale of a couple not that far from Stephen and Tabitha King.  It's about the way a married man and woman will develop a language of their own (and we all do it); a sort of ""clubhouse"" language, that those outside of the ""clubhouse"" won't readily understand.  King does try to remind us throughout the story what words and acronyms such as SOWISA mean, but it does occasionally grate when he overuses them, as if to emphasize a theme that's been overemphasized to the point of being dull.Even though it can be pretty slow-going throughout the first half, you'll be rewarded if you stick with it through to the end.  King's note to his Constant Readers (I've purchased every King book within a week of its release since Cujo came out in 1981) is actually a pleasant read, as opposed to the note at the end of The Dark Tower (Book 7) where he almost seemed to be lecturing his fans.In the 25 years I've been reading King's work, he's certainly had his ups and downs (as have we all), but Lisey's Story is one that King fans will want to pick up or ask for as a gift.  It feels like a much more complete novel than King's last effort, Cell.  You can sense that King lived in the world with these characters and that he cared about them.  No, it isn't perfect, but it provides memorable moments of love, terror and character.  And that's enough to make it worth reading through the imperfections.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IGVKZDTUZUWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743289412#wasThisHelpful","R1IGVKZDTUZUWM","A2K0Y55A5KQSU7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K0Y55A5KQSU7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Superb memoir of a black kid growing up in apartheid, hate-infected, punishingly-severe persecution and deprivation of So. Africa. His chances of achieving anything at all were surely minus zero chance.Through the force of his illiterate mother's determination that he go to school (perhaps she saw potential in where, where others just saw another kaffir), his discovery that he loved learning, and probably most importantly that he learned to play tennis well and loved it, he earned a series of scholarships to American universities. Mathabane went on to marry, father 3 children, become a best-selling author and lecturer.The book dragged for me at the beginning and began to feel repetitious as perhaps 150-200 pages we spent detailing the horrors of growing up in Alexandra, where 100,000 impoverished people lived in 1 sq mile with no sewage system, electricity, transportation, joblessness, laws that kept the huge black population downtrodden and sequestered.Okay, I got it.

There was none of the tragic darkness and inevitability of the good Southern Gothics.Set in the south at the dawn of the Atomic Age, Godwin seems to be trying to juxtapose the murky past with the modern era as Helen, a precocious and self-absorbed mostly brat subtly battles it out w pretty simple-minded, inept Flora, her cousin who has been asked to 'tend her' for the summer while her father is presumably gone to work on "" the bomb.""Mostly, this book irritated and bored me...which is a shame as I've enjoyed many of Godwin's other books.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBBARUXD08OI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBCVZGO#wasThisHelpful","RBBARUXD08OI1","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was expecting 'fluff' when I began reading this book, but sometimes fluff is just what one needs as a break from heavy, long, difficult, political books...or one of the ponderous great classics. I like to balance myself w a paper book and a Kindle, each having different levels of intensity and painful subject matter. So this was to be my 'fluff' book.It wasn't at all! Okay, it's not Dr. Zhivago or Tolstoy or whatever, but there's real meat to it.Coburn balances three topics with grace, insight, grief, love, and compassion: travel memoir, grief, and fear of dying young.The book is definitely more than a travel story. She fears she will die young, as did her father, and the loss of him (too young; smoking; lung cancer) is something she is still working to resolve, both the loss and her own fear. So she sets off to make several trips to Europe with her young daughter (between ages 8-16), ""to make memories,"" one gathers in preparation for what she expects to be her own premature deaths. Along the way, vivid memories of visits with her much loved and very colorful (if unreliable) father match the setting or tone of her travels at the moment.Caveat: she paints her husband as a patient saint, and she and her daughter never, I mean never, have conflict. This is too good to believe.But, wow, I enjoyed this book about 10x more than I expected to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14BTQSUJKMTYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFDVOHI#wasThisHelpful","R14BTQSUJKMTYE","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the Crocodile Eats the Sun, by native-born Zimbabwean Peter Godwin who has lived on several continents and has an international perspective, is very good. It just goes on a bit too long, becomes repetitive, and feels too journalistic in several places. It traces the simultaneous aging and death of Godwin's father in Zimbabwe (where the family has lived for 2-3 generations) alongside the country's rape by Robert Mugabe.Zimbabwe used to be the breadbasket of Africa, and now the Zimbabwean currency is so valueless that it would take several wheelbarrows of paper money to buy a cup of coffee; the now use the US dollar for currency. Unemployment hovers around 85%Life expectancy: 34-37 years (primarily due to the AIDS pandemic)Yet, oddly, the literacy rate is one of the highest in Africa.Fascinating book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12M38FWF7POKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SEIQYA#wasThisHelpful","R12M38FWF7POKI","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fascinating memoir by (yes, he wrote it himself) an autistic savant who also has synesthesia, that condition in which letters, words, and numbers have colors or textures or arouse emotions, like #6 is dark and scary, where Wednesday is blue but Thursday is fuzzy.The author is fascinated with pi, the squares of numbers, and prime numbers. He once memorized pi to 23,000 digits after the decimel point, establishing a record (duh). He calms himself by counting things. Many of us visit a beach for the calming aspect of it, but he finds it distracting because he spends all his time trying to count the grains of sand.The really cool thing is that he lacks most of the areas of social ineptitude that others on the far end of the autistic spectrum usually display, and he is able to maintain a loving relationship and function independently in the world.The writing is a little flat, lacking in emotion, but... he IS autistic, so all things considered, it's pretty amazing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VZCKN1JOIO25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018SY6KI#wasThisHelpful","R1VZCKN1JOIO25","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 1950s, the East End of London, an area packed with slums and tenements, was rife with poor sanitation, prostitution, disease, overcrowding, crime, abuse of women and children, alcoholism... All of these, and more, were commonplace for those who were born and died there.Perhaps worst of all was the nearly total lack of health care. Within this dismal district was a convent of nuns whose mission was nursing, midwifery, and the training of lay women in these healing arts. Into this world teeming with potential disaster comes the twenty-two year old Jennifer Worth, fresh from a failed love affair and determined to become a midwife.The nuns, as individual in personality as they are similar in their religious habits, are memorable, especially Sister Monica Jean, a slightly dotty mischief-mnaker and dessert thief whose slyness indicates she might not always be as loopy as she appears. There is a hint of calculation in her madcap actions.Of the birthing women, perhaps most enchanting is the story of beautiful Conchita, who gives birth to her 23rd and 24th babies during the course of the story and who has a long and loving marriage with a much older, hard-working Cockney jack-of-all-trades. The improbable success of the marriage is explained when Ms. Worth learns that neither Conchita nor her husband has learned to speak the other's language.For me, a home-birth midwife from California who practiced nearly half a century later, the most fascinating parts of The Midwife were those that highlighted the differences in our respective domains. While I often felt as though I was roughing it as I drove my noisy VW Bug to births, Ms. Worth on her heavy bicycle traveling ten miles through London's infamous pea soup fog at 3 AM put me to shame.I carried half a car-full of equipment; she made do with a kit that easily fit into the rear basket of her bike.One of the most educational stories revolved around a women giving birth to a baby coming the wrong way round, not headfirst but a breech. A senior nun's explanation to the young Jennifer of what she is doing and why, and the second by second description of the birth is priceless information from a bygone time.In spite of the word ""memoir"" appearing in the subtitle, I would not classify this book as memoir. It is disappointing that Ms. Worth chose not to revealmuch about herself, so we are unable to watch her evolution. We are left in the dark about the world from which she came. We don't know if she was city or country-bred. The details of her disappointing affair of the heart are unexplained. Was he a married man? And what about her vocation, her calling to the art of midwifery? No reasons are given, so we are denied sharing the sense of fulfillment she must surely have felt as her training drew to a close. Overall, there is little sense of her maturing into her new role, little indication of her changing - until the last line, a statement close to a revelation of faith, which came out of nowhere. It struck me as odd to have the book end with a red herring, a closing comment with no antecedent and no follow-up.While The Midwife falls more into the realm of a valuable historical or anthropological document, eminently readable, and full of unforgettable characters and their stories, ultimately I was left with the desire to know the deeper personal story lying so tantalizingly below the surface.Overall, The Midwife is an enchanting, educational, and revelatory story of the practice of midwifery in a time that seems much further in the past than just sixty years ago. Highly recommended, especially to those interested in midwifery, women's studies, and maternal and child health.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WC08KRN30JZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143116231#wasThisHelpful","R1WC08KRN30JZR","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

From the outset, you just know all of eleven-year-old Ellie's hard work to heal her mother, reform her father, and banish the tempting teen-aged Tomato Girl, are unrealistic and doomed. It's all too much for the eleven-year-old child, the only person in her family who seems to have her head on straight, to manage on her own - and fears of the obvious consequences prevent her from seeking outside help. Against insane odds, Ellie valiantly struggles onward, carrying mesmerized readers along with her.Writing an entire novel in the voice of a child is difficult, but for the most part first-time author Jayne Pupek manages to maintain the tone, awareness, and vocabulary of a pubescent child of the South in a manner that is consistent and authentic.Kudos to both Pupek and her publisher for bringing Tomato Girl to fruition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CL4NTTTWCUOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565124723#wasThisHelpful","R1CL4NTTTWCUOG","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Babies know a lot more about being babies that adults, doctors, grandmothers, how-to specialists, psychologists, and talk show hosts do. I was blessed with a first child that was born to nurse and taught me everything I needed to know about breastfeeding. He was single-mindedly determined to nurse for 20 out of every 24 hours. Everyone thought I was crazy, but it was the only thing that truly kept him happy. He nursed while I slept, nursed while I went grocery shopping, nursed while I brushed my teeth, nursed while I ate dinner - and didn't mind when I dropped spaghetti on his bald head. If he was nursing, he was content, and so was I.Lu Hanessian's book is a thought-provoking confirmation and affirmation for those of us who bucked lots of resistance in various areas of child-rearing, taking our cues from our babies, trying what seemed to make sense, and sticking with what worked, no matter what flack it caused among those peripheral to the immediate family. Babies don't manipulate their parents; they don't even know the word for such a concept. But babies know what they need. It's too bad they have to waste so much energy trying to convince some of us to just slow down and listen to them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4W3WZ5HK2SI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312326971#wasThisHelpful","R4W3WZ5HK2SI6","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't like Tom Cruise. I don't like him, his Scientology `religion,' his strutting style of acting, or the horse he rode in on. BUT. He's really good in Collateral. He plays a ruthless hit man out to eliminate 5-6 people who might potentially testify in an upcoming high-profile trial. He hops into a cab driven by Max, superbly played (I mean, SUPERBLY) by Jamie Foxx, and sets off on an all-night shooting spree.Cruise doesn't change one whit throughout the film: he's a killing machine, period.But Foxx. Omigod, Jamie Foxx begins as a taxi hack in a nowhere life and slowly becomes the reluctant hero of the film as he valiantly (and very improbably, but hey, this is an action movie, so sit back and just take it on faith) tries to save the life of Cruise's last and ultimate victim: the pretty DA in charge of the case.It's exciting and edge-of-your seat tense throughout, and only 3 things really bothered me: 1) It's not believable that a car would overturn and crash to smithereens without either of the occupants getting more than a bruise, and Cruise's clothes don't even get mussed up, 2) It's not possible for women to run that desperately fast in 3-inch heels, and 3) The very last scene of them outside at dawn overlooking a freeway and parking lot was just...empty.

"A Midnight Clear is a stunning, poignant, passionate paean to the futility and tragedy of war. The setup is 6 very young, very bright US soldiers sent on a reconnaissance mission to a chateau deep within the Ardennes Forest in France in December 1944. Use of symbolism deepens the book's meaning: the men (read ""boys"") play chess and bridge (without cards) with deadly passion, one is called Mother because of his mother-hen neatnik qualities, another is called Father because he's a devout Catholic who left seminary cuz he didn't think he was good enough. Their leader is Wont (his name is William Knott, AKA Will Knot, AKA `will not,' thus: won't, usually shortened to Wont), a kid recently promoted to sergeant who hasn't had time to sew his stripes on yet.So they're in this abandoned chateau in the middle of this isolated forest, burning furniture to try to keep warm, and the dialogue and situations are hilarious and horrible, but mostly hilarious...but this is a book about war, so you know bad stuff is going to happen. Reading the first æ of the book, you feel kinda guilty laughing, cuz in the back of your mind, you're wondering which and how many of these kids are going to die.Then they realize there are 6-8 Germans nearby, and their fear is palpable - until it becomes clear that the Germans are just as young and scared as they are, just as sick of war, and even more importantly, the Germans know they're about to lose the war, and they want to surrender.The denouement, when it comes, occupies no more than perhaps one single page, maybe just a couple of paragraphs, and the rest of the book becomes a weird, tragic, very believable mythic, religious, mystery play/metaphor sort of thing with the kind of events and writing that keep you riveted to the last sentence.Highest possible recommendation. I swear it'll eventually become a classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF18FE6FHFOP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557042578#wasThisHelpful","RF18FE6FHFOP8","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood has become a classic, a sprawling Southern novel of the lifelong friendships of 4 women, of the tensions between mothers and daughters, and of the survival, in spite of dark secrets from the past, of love.Siddalee Walker says something unkind (but true) about her mother, Vivi, and this precipitates a gathering of the women who have been Vivi's friends since they were little girls together. Their purpose is to patch things up. Vivi was far from a perfect mother, but when the Ya-Yas (the girlfriends) bring a scrapbook chronicling 7 decades of friendship and family history, Sidalee begins to see the bigger picture.There's a huge cast of characters (most of them females and all of them Southern), but author Rebecca Wells manages to make each come alive as distinct, individual, and wholly memorable.A real tour de force. A laugh a minute with a requisite kernel of darkness at its core.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JNS1T4TUBRV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060928336#wasThisHelpful","R2JNS1T4TUBRV0","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The always complex relationships between mothers and daughters seems to be even more so between Chinese mothers and daughters - and most extremely so when the daughters are American-born. Amy Tan's multi-layered family tale is set against the backdrop of her mother's progressive Alzheimer's and the confusion of past with present that is a recurring and ever-worsening problem for both the mother, Lu Ling, and her daughter, Ruth. Much of the tale is told through a series of journals Lu Ling kept when she was a young woman in China, and the comparison between her situation then and now is poitnant.Not quite The Joy Luck Club, but very, very good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YWHGRIKQR1KF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804114986#wasThisHelpful","R2YWHGRIKQR1KF","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Margaret Atwood should be knighted or something. She just gets better and better, and she started out being very good indeed. For me, The Blind Assassin is her most accomplished book. Most of her books have a bit of mystery at their core, and this is no exception. The Blind Assassin is a spellbinding family saga set against the backdrop of WWI, the Depression, and Communist witch-hunt persecution, but those over-arching themes are played out within the tragedy of one family, the Chases. The matriarch of the pathetically shriveled family is Iris, and she's dying from a heart ailment. Much of the book is told as her recollections back to the wartime suicide of her enigmatic sister, Laura. There's a parallel story interspersed through the main story, and it is the posthumous publication of Laura's novel, ""The Blind Assassin."" There is weirdly sci-fi back-story woven throughout, a plot concocted between a couple between their bouts of lovemaking, and it becomes apparent that the young man is in hiding for political reasons. But even with plentiful clues strewn throughout, it takes a while (maybe halfway into the book) to begin to figure out all the many layers of this complex and mesmerizing literary work. There are flashbacks, flashbacks within flashbacks, distorted memories, flights of fancy - and only a writer of Atwood's consummate skill could keep a handle on all this stuff and have it make perfect sense by the end. Fantastic!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OSRQX57A9TS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385720955#wasThisHelpful","R3OSRQX57A9TS3","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bob Dollar is pretty much a loser, but he's not a crook. He finds himself hired as a scout by Global Pork Rind, and his job is to look for farms that the company can swindle the owners out of in order to put in hog farms. He doesn't really want to do it and manages to stall his employers for pretty much the entire book, meanwhile endearing himself to most of the colorful locals and becoming rather fond of them himself.It's all set in small towns in the Texas Panhandle, which, if Proulx is to be even half-believed, is populated by people with odd names (LaVon Grace Fronk, Jerky Baum, Habakuk van Melkebeek and Freda Beautyrooms, for starters) who live in towns with names with names like Wooleybucket. Keeping pace with Bob Dollars growing love for the harsh and unforgiving region, readers find themselves really caring about these tough characters. Dollar's house of cards comes tumbling down at the end, but he ends up somehow floating to the top of the deck and, while we don't see prosperity in his future, we do see a kind of peace.Annie Proulx has another winner here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYTJ50L0K1T7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743242483#wasThisHelpful","RYTJ50L0K1T7L","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know many people, mostly women, who refuse on principle to watch Pulp Fiction. ""It's too violent,"" they say, without even having seen it. And in several cases, these are the same women who love Carl Hiaasen's books. You want wacko violence? Read Hiaasen. Soooo, what's with not watching Pulp Fiction?Get over it. Watch it anyway. You won't regret it.For about æ of the movie, you just have to take it on faith that the seemingly random bits of action are eventually going to merge and make some sense - and of course they do. The business of waiting, however, is NOT boring; a little confusing maybe, but definitely not boring. There are such spectacular, tongue-in-cheek bits of acting, violence, insanity, horror that you can't take your eyes off the screen. Right now, one particular one comes to mind (no, no, not the one with the brain matter splattered throughout the car's interior): Bruce Willis knows this bad dude is being tortured in a basement dungeon by some even badder guys, and sort of against his better judgment he decides he's gotta do something about it, even tho the guy being tortured has been determined to kill him (Willis). So he's in this store on the main floor, looking for a weapon - and meanwhile you hear the horrible sounds of the guy to whom terrible things are being done - and Willis is taking his sweet time, weighing a big gun against a mace against a pistol against a cudgel against a - - -  Aha! At last, just when you're ready to scream ""THE GUN, TAKE THE GUN"" at him, he finds what he's looking for: a samurai sword. And off he trots to save his would-be assassin.And what a cast. In addition to Willis, you've got Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Amanda Plummer, etc.Unbelievably terrific quirky wacko wild and wooly violent (yeah, it is violent) nutso twisted corrupt wicked hilarious top dog of a movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15TGTNSDC5T18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000068DBC#wasThisHelpful","R15TGTNSDC5T18","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Smilla Jaspersen is half American and half Eskimo/Greenlander living in Denmark. She is 37, unmarried, and filled with a quiet caustic rage that overflows occasionally into determined action. She is also an expert, thanks to her Inuit mother, on the properties of snow and the significance of tracks left in snow.Smilla is befriended by a pitiful child, Isiah, and the novel begins with the discovery of his body on the ground below a 7-story building, from the roof of which he apparently fell. But Smilla isn't so sure. For one thing, he was afraid of heights. For another, it appears that a needle biopsy of his leg muscle was taken after his death. But most of all, there are his tracks, only his, in the snow, but Smilla can see his panic, his running, his fear in the properties of those tracks.Smilla is nothing if not determined, and she embarks on a quest to discover the truth behind the child's death, a quest that nearly costs her her own life.Excellent, nail-biting suspense and powerful, literary-quality writing.

"The first of perhaps 4 times I saw Harold and Maude was at a theater in Berkeley on University Avenue. I must have been the only person in the audience who had never seen this iconic black-humor film before, because the entire audience applauded for every credit that came on the screen both at the beginning and again at the end. It was obviously a cult film with a rabid cult following, and I wondered what I was getting myself in for.Well. I had no idea what I'd been missing! Harold and Maude (Maude is played by the inimitable Ruth Gordon in one of the best roles of her very long career) is perhaps the blackest of black comedies - and it's a hoot and a half - and then some. It portrays the unlikely but, given the context, perfectly understandable relationship (love affair?) between a death-obsessed teenager, Harold, and an life-celebrating octogenarian widow, Maude. They meet (where else) at a funeral of someone that neither of them knows and they recognize their weird common-ground: funerals.This movie is sweet. It's endearing, touching, beautiful, life-affirming - it's a romance and a passionate plea to reach out and grab life by the lapels, suck it of its essence before it's too late.Marvelous, marvelous - but a warning: you've got to be a certain kind of quirky person in a particularly quirky frame of mind to appreciate it. If you fit the description, this might become one of your favorite movies of all time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V9EYTJG2FAW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6305882592#wasThisHelpful","R3V9EYTJG2FAW2","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Romantic comedy with stellar cast. Jack Nicholson plays himself, an aging Lothario chasing younger women. A heart attack lands him in the seaside home of the mother of one of those young women. This 'mother' turns out to be Diane Keaton, a playwright of some fame. An interesting little triangle develops. Keanu Reeves, the cardiologist, falls hard for Keaton, who is always one sexy dame. Nicholson falls for her, too. Keaton is in the enviable position of having 2 men, who have maybe a 25 year age gap between them, salivating over her.The scenes of the developing relationship, including a nude scene for Keaton and a bare-butt scene for Nicholson, are marvelous fun and quite believable.The there are detractions. Frances McDormand's talents are wasted in a role as Keaton's sister, a role that is far too small for her. Reeves' role is understated, gentlemanly - and ultimately unbelievable. Not unbelievable in terms of a man falling for a woman 15+ years his senior, but unbelievable in terms of the minimal emotional range he brings to his performance.But the best part by far is the fact that this romantic comedy doesn't deal with the foibles of 20-30yo actors; it focuses with truth and affection on the foibles of a 'mature couple.'Great theater.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGLXAVEODF1WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001AVZA8#wasThisHelpful","RGLXAVEODF1WB","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Dinklage is a wonderful actor with a huge emotional range in his body language and facial expressions, and he also happens to be one of the 'little people.' For whatever reason might be at the root of his obsession, he's a nut for trains. He works in a model train shop, and then one day the owner falls over dead and Dinklage finds that he has inherited an abandoned depot in rural NJ. He walks there, following the tracks. In fact, a lot of the movie occurs while one character or another is walking along the tracks.He makes several friends in his new community, but two are destined to become real keepers, and both of them are suffering from loss. Patricia Clarkson has lost a child, and a wacky Bobby Cannavale, the guy who runs a mobile coffee stand, is trying hard to care for an ailing father who makes unreasonable demands on him. There's also a pretty librarian who comes to rely on Dinklage, a plumb African-American 8yo who persuades him to come to her school as a show and tell specimen, some rough town guys who make the usual midget jokes, and others.Not a whole lot happens, but by the end, you realize you've watched the anatomy of friendship develop right in front of your eyes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S3KO2H9LWWZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001WTWDI#wasThisHelpful","R3S3KO2H9LWWZI","A2ODBHT4URXVXQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought six of these to go with a table I built for a friend and her two kids, so I have quite a bit of experience with them.. They are heavy, sturdy and very well crafted.  Malaysian crafting (their point of origin) is much better than what is coming out of China. They look and feel like a much more expensive stool. The only problem with these are the hex head lag bolts you use to put them together. . They look like they are made out of brass at first glance, but they are actually a softer alloy.Someone else mentioned that the hex tool that comes with them is cheap and strips. That is true and it does so almost immediately when installing the bottom rung.. One reason for that is that the holes on each end of the front and back cross bars, (the sides come assembled) are very tight. Once the screw gets almost flush with the leg (it needs to recess about 1/2 inch more) the trouble starts. The head on some begin to strip. Some will install but it is tough going! My drill wouldn't push it to the end.Once the head strips you are stuck with no way to tighten the rung. Luckily the softness of the metal means you can use a 3/8 inch bit to drill through the head and twist it off with pliers. You can then back the screw out with vice grips or such. 20 minutes later you are back where you started, short one bolt!  So now you need to run out and find a replacement.. Unfortunately replacements are not to be found at either Lowe's or Home Depot. I was able to make do with a zinc #14, 2 inch Phillips head. 2.5 would be perfect but the 2 was all they had and it worked. They have lag bolts but all of the heads are too wide to properly recess in the hole.To fix this issue  in my next constructions, I took a a 1/4 drill bit and reamed out each end of the rung slightly. This made the hole slightly bigger and the bolt was able to be inserted without being loose. As a precaution I added a drop of Gorilla glue to each bolt. If you have ever used the stuff it expands so it will fill any space around the bolt and jam the insert into the leg tightly.Another problem with the rungs is twisting. Each rung has a nipple with a hole in the end (the one enlarged above). The nipple inserts into the leg and the bolt is inserted from the other side of the leg. The slight angle where the rung meets the leg is not enough to fully stabilize it.  What I did was to put two drops of clear gorilla glue on each nipple before inserting it (remember to add a drop of water to the hole because Gorilla glue needs moisture to cure).. Once dry the rungs won't shift.After you have attached both sides you are ready for the top. For some reason none of my top holes were too small but after enduring the bottom issue I hit them with the drill just to make sure. I found there was a enough play in the design to slip one side of the wooden pins protruding from the seat into the leg holes and then pry the sides apart slightly to pop the other into place without loosening the rungs. The top bolts went in without a hitch.I used a ratcheting screwdriver for the entire assembly. Because the heads were so soft I preferred not to risk using my drill to drive them.  Once you get the hang of it, they are pretty easy to do...and the finished product is well worth the hassle. One thing I added were 25mm (1 inch) felt pads under the feet. They are kind of rough and my friend has hardwood floors...","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UN5LYK7YDNJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HM64YI#wasThisHelpful","R1UN5LYK7YDNJ8","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jim Mars has always seen the big picture. I spend a lot of time looking at it as well because nothing makes sense at the micro level. Our water is poisoned with water destroying fracking, even in CA where a drought is endangering our food supply.

"if you are thinking of using these stones for any sort of jewelry look elsewhere for AAA or AA quality.  It is a shame that so few of Amazon's stones come with the grade assigned.

What  flash there is that is larger than a penny is a very pale green..  Also the stones come looking like chunks of ill-shaped concrete. They are not nicely ""edged"" slabs like ones in the picture. They all needed to be cut to reveal anything worth having. And it is not easy to hold them steady in a vice for cutting without chipping off pieces..

There are also very few vendors or neat weapons, which made the earlier games more fun. Go to inventory and you are again confronted with the tiny fuzzy text. Graphics overall are poor.

"I collect movies and bought this movie based on the 5 star reviews.  I just don't get it. All I can figure is that the movie industry is now paying reviewers instead of script writers.The raccoon was cute, but the lack luster script was largely carried by the 70's soundtrack. Beyond that it was two hours of battle scenes and special effects.. It also took the idea that 'evil"" is a good reason to do something WAY too far. How about some real motivation?? Only one character had it because he lost his wife and child and he pretty much forgot about it when someone told him to ""get over it"".  He was also belittled for having a vocabulary and I'm not talking about words you'd have to look up, I'm talking about words most people used to know before the dumbing down of America. Useful only as a testament to how low our taste and acceptance of banality has fallen.

"I've tried three vendors for this stone on amazon and all produce about the same quality with Fantasia giving the best lot. What I got from this company was a lower in quality than the others with no usable sized flash showing on any rock when opening the pack. None look like the pictures even when wet. It appears that what is being sold is A grade roughs. These look like AA grade roughs in the picture but are almost all matrix and have no flash. The stone most people want when it comes to this gem is the one that produces ""an oil on water like ""flash"" from several angles. You might find a little of that in AA stones and a good bit more in AAA. I have spotted a few tiny flashes on this shipment but none that would make a nice piece of jewelry. We are talking about 1/8 of an inch and less flash. Some have a side that looks like opalescent glass but that is not what you buy this for. I also bought a slab from the same vendor and while most of it had decent flash it only showed from one angle. I have several pieces of jewelry using Labradorite and all have more color. Much of the Fantasia pack was also a pale green and not the brilliant blue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X26SFMJBGQMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXEZDVI#wasThisHelpful","R2X26SFMJBGQMP","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here in the South we like strong dark coffee. This combo not only brews well but it gives you three choices of strength, regular, strong or bold. It also has 5 grind settings to accommodate the number of cups you want to make. The unit does not require paper filters and has a nice wire mesh basket that does not contain much plastic. Unfortunately if you are like me and don't like your coffee or hot water to the touch much plastic, you are out of luck. The basket that holds the brewing filter is solid plastic. One star off for that, but finding one that doesn't use plastic is nearly impossible. Still we Southern folks want perfection in our coffee. Take a hint B and D! Other than making the coffee, it also keeps it warm with a built in hot plate and you can set it to wake you up with the smell of a fresh pot. Can't beat that!One issue I have found with it is that it can be hard to clean. The lid that snaps down over the grinding basket tends to get full of grinds when making large pots. You may not notice this at first but it is important to clean it. Don't let grinds sit in the basket for any length of time as the bottom has lots of divisions and is hard to clean if you let it set too long. I recommend cleaning as soon as the basket is cool to the touch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R9F59HXC6K72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I46E#wasThisHelpful","R3R9F59HXC6K72","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately there isn't enough variation in the card messages to use it like that..As expected, the cards are all variation of her theme that your vibration attracts same.  But several themes are actually being repeated with minor variations. Here is an example: ""I can stop attractions to don't wants by do wants"" , ""I can get from an unwanted to a wanted relationship.""  ""The thoughts I think determine the relationship I attract,"" ""By my attention to things I make choices,"" ""I must focus on wanted to manifest wanted"", ""I can focus on what I do want in a relationship,"" My attention to Unwanted can't defy the law of attraction, ""That which is like unto itself, is drawn"".

"First do your homework. Paul Barrett testified for Chevron. Know that the compassion the book seems to show for the people of the Amazon is just an attractive stage play to hook you in. The rest of the book is a mix of well reported legal maneuvering combined with mostly subtle Donziger bashing that would give someone who doesn't know who Barrett is, the feeling they are reading a fair and impartial account. Also check the profiles of the 5 star reviewers. How many only review this book or just this and one or two other things? Most also use the basic Amazon Initial in a colored block review icon suggesting they didn't take the time to personalize their reviewer page. I fully expect to be trolled by the oil insiders...but I don't write reviews to up my ratings. I write them to give people yet another point of view on a book....read on if you like!That said, I spent over a week trying to get through the horrors of the first fifty pages of this book. It describes the atrocities committed against the Amazonian people who had dynamite dropped on their heads from planes and attempts made to move them off their land by a Texaco funded ""Christian Group"" out of Oklahoma. Not much more is said about this group. Having been paid to set up a new ""Christian home"" for the natives, they apparently watched dispassionately and silently while the oil company poisoned indigenous people's land, rivers, children and animals. You have to wonder why they never saw ""the big picture"", but then using religion to infiltrate and destroy culture is unfortunately one of the oldest tricks in the book. Not to worry though!  This isn't a book about bashing Christians. It is a well written and seductive bash of Steven Donziger. You get the first hint of it when Barrett bashes Donziger's 1996 book ""The Real War on Crime."" In it, Donziger pointed out that our criminal justice system was being seeded both at the State and Federal level with harsh triple offender and mandatory sentencing laws. Today we are finally waking up to the fact that this has made us not only the most incarcerating country in the world, but prepared us for the advent of corporate owned prisons and the movement of entire factories behind bars. He tried to warn us that we were not reducing crime by reducing people to a prison number. Barrett apparently couldn't resist bashing the one book out there with Donziger's name on it. This seemed oddly out of place in a fair minded book on the Amazon.While the evidence against Texaco (bought by and defended by Chevon ) is damning, with much of it coming from its own documents,, the onus here is placed on Donziger for his tactics. I am from Louisiana and we are fighting for our lives right now against big oil. Much of our state is dotted with injection wells that leak silently into water tables. The canals they ceaselessly cut through our marsh, allowing salt water intrusion, have caused much of the bottom of our state to disappear. Like with the Amazon, our laws have been perverted to allow open waste pits, most of which overflowed into our waterways when Katrina hit. Like the government of Ecuador, our government is complicit in both not investigating discharges and in allowing big oil off the hook when problems can be identified.  We here in Louisiana fully understand what it is like to have the officials who should protect us ""owned"" by big oil. If Donziger used the press in unscrupulous ways, God bless him! Every plea for justice we utter here is met by paid oil media trolls, outrageous laws and more cancers even though we are already number one in the nation. But I digress....I see this book as a lesson in the more ""subtle"" aspects of defamation. It is a masterwork of pro-oil propaganda that combines just enough sympathy for humanity with ceaseless pro-oil innuendo.  It often uses implied rather than direct ridicule. A good example is the statement about Sting and Darrel Hannah being involved in an ad campaign where Darrel displays an oil covered hand. There is no explanation of WHY this shouldn't be done, but it is stated as if it is just one more nail in the coffin of unfairness to Chevron....This kind of implied impropriety is deadly because it bypasses most people's logic filter. While ""Law of the Jungle"" starts out appearing to care about the Rain Forest it is not about suffering people. It is about a dizzying array of legal maneuvers and decisions. It could be instructive if it were not for the fact that the Trans-Pacific Partnership so few know about, will essentially circumvents our national laws to allow corporate international courts dominance in issues such as this..","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DOPZR265OVVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077043634X#wasThisHelpful","R1DOPZR265OVVH","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I highly recommend you get this book and slog through it with a highlighter. There is a lot of great information here. Unfortunately it gets buried in too many digressions about the character and lives of the many people who make up the story. It also makes too many forays into the ancient history of whales, the whaling industry and Marine Biology. Each of these topics would be interesting on their own, and a certain amount of this information is necessary, but the constant digression is frustrating to a reader who is more interested in the Naval aspect and what can be done to circumvent this ongoing problem.The main issues with the Navy remind me a lot of  what we live with here in Louisiana. The oil and gas industry has roughly the same MO;  make sure regulatory agencies are underfunded or handicapped in one way or another, deny the public access to needed information and when needed create laws to protect what you are doing. The Navy of course has the added benefit of evoking the security state. In the end, although often staffed by good people, the book makes it clear that these protective agencies exist only by treading carefully on the tail of the tiger they are supposed to be controlling.The third level in this war is one we have become too familiar with, the Supreme Court majority's many transgressions. As usual the story pits the corporate/military/industrial, Roberts against Ruth Ginsburg's judicial elegance in defeat. In the end, War of the Whales is not just about the demise of whales at the hands of the Navy, it is yet another showcase for a corrupt system, aided by secrecy, that has our country beaching itself while bleeding from the ears.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R938OAQJT2CQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451645015#wasThisHelpful","R938OAQJT2CQ","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I waited eagerly for this film to come out.  The book was fabulous on so many levels. It asked thought provoking questions about the relationship between men and women, women and women, and humans and animals and it even included questions for discussion at the end. Everything that was intriguing or thought provoking in the book is missing. What replaces it is are shots of Scarlett Johansson staring into space, with and without clothes. Seriously, that is a major part of the film. This film goes beyond slow to tedious. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the story I'd read would suddenly burst forth...it never happened. You might as well turn off the volume and treat it as an abstract art film.Perhaps the biggest initial turn-off was the choice of Johansson. In the book, Isserley was not a beautiful woman, having been (painfully) engineered to feature the large breasts that would cause men to leer at a plain girl with the thick glasses she required to see on earth. That fact made the culling of the hunky men she chose much more palatable. They were to a large extent the victim of their intentions to use someone. The objectification of women was a large part of the story. Isserley was also constantly reflecting on her environment. Her alien insights were intriguing, something not captured by the dull stares they were replaced with in the film.In the end, what takes the place of depth and story line is a very slow and repetitive movie interspersed with a bit of fancy CGI. A group of alien men on motorcycles occasionally zip around to clean up any details left behind by her abductions but that is as action oriented as it gets. Forget this one...I already have.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28YKWA2BQ6SZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJ3EHCG#wasThisHelpful","R28YKWA2BQ6SZT","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It goes much deeper into the science of health than the average person may wish to delve and even includes a pack of PH strips to chart your progress. With so many ""get well quick books"" on the market, this appears on first glance to be the ugly duckling of the diet world. But the American obsession with instant gratification has not convinced the body to change its biology. Good nutrition and health take time. This is a system that builds health over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBK1HEJKFI3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373893000#wasThisHelpful","R3MBK1HEJKFI3T","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun little book. It gives you the original ethnic recipes for many of your favorite foods as well as where to eat them should you go to the country and want the best in town. Each recipe has an intro page composed over a color photograph and a paragraph or two dedicated to ""What is it?"", Origin, Tasting and Finding it.

"At first it at least worked on my Fire TV but then it started quitting and bumping back to the main screen once I bought lures. The game itself is very limited. You can't move the boat and have limited casting options and no speed reel-in when you want to recast. The first upgrade to lures and line are cheap but then the price quickly goes up to a ridiculous amount. $300 for line or a bass lure???Once you win enough to buy the good stuff, (and given the limitations- the win is more luck than skill),  all it takes is one broken line to lose the lure. You don't have an option to release the line, only lower the pole and reel. So a snag a big fish and your line with your $300 lure snaps! Skip this unless you really like to spin the right button with your thumb for hours on end.And one more annoying thing this is now doing...The line makes a whirring noise...When the program glitches and throws you back to the main screen...even if you EXIT the program the sound continues. Call up a movie the sound continues over the film.

"Combine Super Mario Brothers with better graphics driven by the ""idea"" of Memory Control and you have Remember me. The concept of Memory Control is not a big part of the majority of actions you are asked to perform. They are a quick and easy button push on ""missions"" while you spend the majority of your time ""fighting"" without using your powers at all. That doesn't even make sense. If she is so good a memory blanking why doesn't she blank the memories of guards and other adversaries you are constantly meeting?And you spend most of your time jumping, running and fighting along a predetermined path while trying to get to the next cut scene..thus the Mario Brothers reference. Along the way you learning new fighting moves. How does that differ from even the earliest XBOX games?? So what are the challenges...when precision moves are required to travel between destinations (that don't really qualify as ""missions""), the game suddenly skews your controls slightly to make it harder to get there. Add to that a few puzzles that involving moving across signs with flipping parts. Once you realize that moving along ledges IS the better part of the game, those are annoying enough to cause you to put your controller down and read a good book. This is fun????Fighting and killing is pretty boring at this point, especially given the advanced capabilities of platforms like Xbox and PlayStation to provide true character interaction and growth. And hey...you didn't buy this game with the promise of more head bashing. You wanted to use your brain more than your thumb. Forget it! If we all refuse to accept violence in the place of creativity maybe the gaming industry will wake up.

"I haven't used all of the features on this projector but for projecting my art work and movies on my bedroom wall it rocks!! My bedroom is lavender and while a white background gives the best image, you really don't notice the tint at all. It projects a 4 foot by 7 foot image from about 8 feet away with great color. The only thing I wish it had was an audio OUT. Devices that operate only with HDMI connectivity often lack other audio options. Since I use Fire TV with this, neither of them offers an audio out other than HDMI No earphone jack means you are stuck with the sound from the projector.The sound quality of the unit is good for movies and light music listening but it is not engineered to provide superior sound. That isn't something you really expect from a projector.

"I lost a cousin to AIDS who could have greatly benefited from the supplement regime in this movie. Sadly, his father worked for what should have been the best of all places, a major pharmaceutical company. He believed in the flawed system shown in this film. Watch this for the great acting and the great information.Our access to a variety of supplements and natural products like raw milk and cheese from local farmers is being taken away from us by an FDA/USDA run for the purposes of major drug, agricultural and biotech companies. This film shows one of the many tragic results. When it comes to food and drugs, I believe in informed consent, not bans and fines. Seeing this film will teach you a lot about the dangers of letting drug companies supersede human rights.  If you want more info on the plot, there are many reviews here that give you that. I think it is such a wonderful educational opportunity that I want to comment mostly on the FDA aspect. Please note that this review will likely receive negative comments touting  the wonders of the FDA . There are people paid to do that and I have seen them show up every time big pharma is questioned. I don't get paid to answer them and won't waste my time.I'm surprised that Big Pharma allowed this film to be made. They are THAT powerful. As coincidence would have it, I finally got around to watching it shortly after learning that it had long been known, in another country, that a substance in Soy could treat AIDS. Note that is REAL SOY, not the GMO, ""Round Up Ready"", stuff we have here which is rich in pesticide residue. Why were we not told about this years ago?? Who is REALLY protecting our health and well-being. Certainly NOT the FDA. As this film shows, it only protects the drug patents of major U.S. manufacturers and biotech companies and much of medicine supports it for financial gain.Only last week, the FDA had approved a pain killer so lethal that states are now moving to ban it. How protective of human life is that?? If you don't already know, the FDA with its Corporate Dons, like former policy maker for Monsanto Micheal Taylor, (over food) and  Virginia Weldon (former Monsanto VP for public policy) now on the FDA Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee have been running a virtual war on supplements for decades.The reason is simple. Many of them work really well and most are from natural products which have to be synthesized to be patented. If they haven't figured out how to defy nature (the process of synthesizing often has side effects not present in the original) they don't want to see a natural drug that works on the market.  It is also easy to dissuade people from using them because most natural remedies work over time and don't have the immediate punch the pharmaceutical companies like to advertise. But your body doesn't like to be ""punched"". The movie illustrates that very well as the effects of AZT devastate patients in the early trials...This while the medical industry, which benefits financially from participation in these studies...gladly touted their worth...least they not be asked to do another.Symptomatic treatments that do nothing to enhance the body's immune system or replace vital nutrients do not create health. They create drug dependence. In a truly free society, informed consent would be the norm. Now go watch the film and tell your friends to watch it too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V261FKUQ2BL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUO3C3W#wasThisHelpful","R3V261FKUQ2BL6","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My buns own the kitchen and I always have hay in their bin. They love to scatter it everywhere but I can rake it up fairly easily with a fur broom. The problem here is that instead of rake ready hay, they reduce it to small bits of hay less then a half inch which is much harder to clean.

"I bought this program from the Sony Website because I have Vegas Pro 12 and wanted to add more effects. I watched several promo videos and was impressed with what it could do.  So I downloaded it and went to the site, hoping to find a downloadable manual I could use to orient myself.  I found the only written material was comprised of short articles on the various parts of the program. Each was only a page or two long but contained numerous imbedded links. I've seen other online tutorials use this style and it is not a good way to learn. You can't automatically see what you are looking for without opening multiple screens. That gets very tedious and time consuming.There are many video tutorials available but all that I have seen suffer a huge flaw. The Hitfilm interface has too many small drop down menus which are nearly impossible to see on a video. I even enlarged some of the screens with my projector but then the menu items became too fuzzy to read. Going back and forth between youtube and your Hitfilm screen while trying to figure out which menu the instructional video just opened can drive you batty. It would help if the videos did a pop-up of the area being accessed so you can actually see what is being clicked....and SLOW down the delivery. It would also help if they don't jump from set up to finished render as if that magically happens! I hope the Infinite Skills company produces a training video for this at some point. They can at times go TOO slow but that is better than the unrelated bits and pieces approach provided here via videos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N1Q9VNJQ108G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A27IQZW#wasThisHelpful","R2N1Q9VNJQ108G","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The program is useful and easy to learn as long as you want to build a conventional home with an ordinary roof. If you want to get creative and build a barrel roof you are out of luck. If you want a round concrete home like a monolithic dome with a half sphere roof...no go. I have had three versions of this program over the years and it amazes me that they seem to take away rather than add to the design features. I know my oldest, cheapo, Home Designer had a simple barn-like roof and a slanted roof you could just click on. Now you have to do 5 steps to achieve the slanted and I couldn't make the barrel roof I wanted at all. I've always wanted to combine a steel barrel roof with a container home...can't do it with this and I don't even think their full program  can do it.

You have to remove the roof regardless of what you are doing on the second floor unless it is an exact copy of the size of the bottom floor. That gets old.

"These cards would work better if they were oversized like the Starseed Tarot, The large color reproductions of the major arcana found in the accompanying booklet are very engaging but, even though the imagery is beautiful, there is too much of it and meanings tend to lose themselves in a sea of decorate patterns. This works well for the single oriental figure in the nine of Pentacles (and cards with only one figure in general), but not so well for the five and six of Wands. Aside from that the cards are thick and well made with gold edges.The box is sturdy and the 5"" by 7 3/4 "" full color booklet easy to read and well illustrated. The meanings are close approximations of the Rider Waite and four spreads are provided and explained. I have tried doing a few spreads with them but found them to lack the kind of instant intuitive connection I get with most decks. The reason for that is explained above. The decorative aspect is overwhelming. Depending on which cards you select you can find your eyes swimming in a sea of detail that takes a while to settle down into meaning.

"When I first got this book I had a hard time making myself start the read. It is mostly writing with a few black and white pictures and when it mentioned Damanhur and Findhorn I began to assume that it was really a collection of well advertised commercial communities and didn't have much to offer someone wanting to start one. I'm glad I was wrong!She gives the location of the book's website where you can find lots of great pictures of each community and the information she discusses is not by any stretch of the imagination, a commercial. While she is an academic with credentials in the field of sustainability, the writing is aimed at the causal reader. It is very down to earth and deals with the real issues that affect starting an alternative community. She spent two week at each of these places and writes from the perspective of someone who learns not only about their culture, but about the very human problems that crop up when people attempt to live with more than 10 or 20 of your closest friends.The problems are similar in some ways. People who choose to live an alternative lifestyle have to be strong enough in their beliefs to walk away from the flock. That very strength can make them uncompromising. One community, ""Earthhaven""  had 50 members when a major problem arose. The state of South Caroline closed its borders to over night guests because it was using water from a spring which it deemed to be unsanitary. Arguments arose from purists in the group who felt that drilling a water well was desecrating the Earth. Since they derived operating funds from their educational outreach this quickly led to financial issues. As you might imagine, people being passionate about beliefs can cause many issues. Can a Vegan eat next to someone who has free range chicken on their plate? Not always. As one director put it, they don't HAVE to accept compromise at this point. In a real emergency food and water situation people would probably be more accepting of each other. As things stand, people are still free to squabble, disagree and leave.The communities themselves vary greatly as well. Italy's Damanhur, a spiritual community led by its charismatic leader Falco, appears to be heavily funded and features smartphones for everyone and a molecular biology lab to test GMO food. While it does research into sustainable foods, I was glad to see she didn't fall in love with Damanhur. I was initially wowed by its underground temples until an Italian friend shared some not so spiritual information about Falco's financial dealings.Other communities, like Colufifa in Senegal, are on the other end of the spectrum, existing with very little in the way of funds. Colufifa represents an alliance of 350 West African villages dedicated to organic farming, adult literacy and microfinancing. Each of the fourteen villages she visits has its problems and perks, with most of the problems involving either groups of people within the village transitioning to different mindsets or collisions with existing laws and culture. It also seems that unless they want to make lots of money or take on a social problem...there isn't a lot of support for these groups in our corporate world.

"This turns my backpack into a mini file cabinet. I can easily access all 5 inclosed folders without having to pull everything out. The flip top filing is very convenient and each folder is open across the top and one side but sealed on the bottom so the contents doesn't end up slipping down and getting lost in the bottom.

"I collect decks and have over one hundred. I like to purchase decks that are unusual in some way. Unfortunately, many of those are unusable because they stray too far from the original meanings of the cards without calling themselves an ""oracle"" rather than a tarot deck. So the question for me when purchasing a deck becomes; is the art work worth having regardless of its value as a tarot and does it pull off that rare combination of unusual beauty and insightful readability? I'm happy to say that Starseed does both with an added bonus.With many improvements geared to a more spiritual take on worldly events, the deck is still recognizable for those used to the traditional Rider Waite. The suits are changed as follows: Orbs=Swords, Chalices=Cups, Crystals=Pentacles and Fire=Wands but most of the cards retain the essential elements of their original imagery. This means it is accessible to fairly new readers and even beginners. One issue with the Rider Waite that can limit new reader's interpretations is its reference throughout the minor arcana to strictly mundane rather than spiritual events. If you want to know the basic who, what, and where of a situation, the minor cards and people cards will usually give you a fairly accurate description of an event. While this pleases and even wows most people who want a reading, those seeking to solve personal issues with a spiritual base will be less served. The non-material value of that event is usually lost unless the reader is astute enough to ask the right questions or intuitive enough to see deeply into the person's life philosophy.In most decks, while the traditional meanings of the Ace through ten cards focus on their value as external events, it is left to the major arcana to inject spirituality, and to the reader to figure out just what that relationship is. Experienced readers who have done their own inner work can usually bridge the gap, but new readers run the risk of adhering too literally to the card images and missing the ""big picture."" This disconnect is well bridged both by the cards and the booklet that Cori provides.A good example of the differences in Cori's cards and interpretations is the infamous Seven or Swords. It normally depicts a sly looking person running off with a bunch of swords. Its traditional meaning is duplicity, a thief in your midst who works behind the scenes to steal the swords, or means of victory. As morning dawns the opponent has no weapons with which to fight. Scenarios come to mind of everything from a lying boyfriend to the corporate espionage of Wall Street. It is easy to point fingers when this card comes up. We have a rogue in our midst! He needs to be discovered or something of value will be taken. What is left out of the discussion is the whole idea of grasping as a way of life.Cori's interpretation for the seven of Orbs (Swords) focuses on the weight of things being taken rather than just the taker.  In the Starseed we see a man in a balloon trying to grab all the orbs in the sky. He does not realize that this will surely crash his balloon and make him a prisoner of his own greed. So the meaning of the card is shifted slightly. Instead of arousing our need to punish a bad guy, we are asked to contemplate the spiritual weight of his greed. In this way we are both warned about the proclivities of the person in question and asked to consider the real cost to ourselves of hanging on to the thing we risk losing. Many of the minor cards in the Starseed have been given a similar twist from material to spiritual consideration.Changes to the major arcana are many and will delight readers who find traditional images like the Hierophant being depicted as a Pope limiting. Cori starts with a replacement for the Fool in the form of a ball of energy that looks like a meteor descending toward a group of crystals. I like this image better than the hapless, medieval image of a cosmic clown because it suggests the descent of an informed spiritual intention entering the world of matter (remember Crystals=Pentacles the traditional earth suit). It also transforms the Fool from a card of choice of paths to one of remembrance and reuniting with one's soul mission.The Magician is also transformed. Traditionally his raised arm channels universal forces to do his bidding in the world. Here he becomes an Indigo child with images of the earth for eyes. The Magician's dominion over all the suits has changed slightly. He has become the force the Magician conjured and is no longer beholding to rituals and manipulation of forces. There is no need to reach outside him, only to wisely use that which has been given. Other major arcana cards which have undergone name changes are Temperance=Alchemy, Judgment=Karma, Death=Transition, Devil=Shadow, World=Ascension, Emperor=Reason, Empress=Abundance. And then there is my personal favorite Hierophant=Guidance; the idea that we do not need human intermediaries between ourselves and the creator, nor a King-like god to rule over us is a concept whose time has definitely come.The main drawback to these cards, especially when being used to do readings for others is finding a space large enough to spread them out and having hands big enough to shuffle them.  Cori has stated that she wanted them to be large enough to use for meditation. They are that and printed on quality stock with a very nice slick finish. They also come in a very sturdy box all at a bargain price given the quality. However, I do hope that at some point this deck is offered in two sizes, one being a pocket edition, like the Thoth Tarot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26XHRWZRCHGSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583945369#wasThisHelpful","R26XHRWZRCHGSW","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure what to make of ""Book of Heaven"" when I first started to read it. The language was a little too poetic for me. I was worried I would never read a sentence that flowed in a straight-forward manner. But after I cleared the initial description of the new constellations, the four stories flowed easily.  I absolutely loved the book and the deep insight the author showed into the human condition. Storace masterfully captures the arrogance that can accompany religious dogma and how it infects those who deem themselves ""one with God"". It shines a harsh light on the sins of patriarchy as well as those men and women who draw power from it.  It also delves deep into the souls and means of women whose lives depend on reading every nuance of their master's mood.  There are so many great quotes in this book that make you stop and ponder. One of my favorites is ""For it is said we wait for God's judgment in the life to come; but our lives here are our judgment of God."" And that is not to say that this book is for people interested in religion. It is about the ways in which various beliefs create culture and give rise to privilege.I don't want to include spoilers but the various races encountered in this book ask us to consider some serious questions about where our own culture is going, especially the Angelican's who destroy so much while calling it a quest for ""Paradise.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XHTSBI5Y8Z8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375408061#wasThisHelpful","R1XHTSBI5Y8Z8M","ARK5SAGVLW3FY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARK5SAGVLW3FY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Nancy Tillman's children's books are about love, happiness, and joy in the child's existence. No matter where you are in the world or universe, my love will find a way it to state that. No matter how far apart a child is away from a loved one, love will find a way to their heart.Separation makes the heart fonder when loved ones are apart whether on earth or elsewhere.

"Gerald McRaney and Jameson Parker played Richard and Andrew Simon, brothers and partners in a small private detective agency in San Diego, California. They were well-casted to play brothers who were opposites in personality. AJ was more straight laced and attractive while Richard was the older and streetwise brother. The series would last eight long seasons. The first season was only 13 episodes which signals that this series was a midseason replacement for CBS in the early eighties.The appeal of the series is both the believable relationship between the brothers and their cases. In 1981, crime dramas were less violent and mild compared to today's crime dramas. If there is any blood shed in the first season, it's minimal. Most of the episodes were surrounded by cases about robbery, burglary, stolen identities, kidnapping, and rarely murder if any in the episodes. The episodes were crafted to have a chase or the big reveal. The series has it's light-hearted moments in the first season.Gerald McRaney and Jameson Parker should have been nominated for Emmys for their performances. I enjoyed the supporting cast of Jeannie Wilson and Mother Simon played by Mary Carver. There were plenty of notable guest stars like Ruta Lee, Natalie Schaefer, Peter Graves, Markie Post, and others in the first season.

"Mei Fong's non-fiction account of how the one child policy has effected China in all aspects of life. Before the policy was instituted, the Chinese population was nearing one billion. The Chinese government felt it best to limit a couple to one child unless they are twins or triplets. The government instituted the policy and had enforced it heavily. The book covers all avenues of the one child policy especially when a catastrophic earthquake wiped thousands of only children and their parents resort to reverse sterilization and have another child. The author also explains how the country has millions of eligible single men and a drought of eligible single women.Mei Fong fuses her own personal experience as a Chinese American journalist and woman in China. The horror stories of forced abortions and infanticide is barbaric even if it is policy or law. The Chinese have become aware of the ramifications for such harsh policy. Thousands of Chinese girls were adopted abroad and left a void in their population.If you want to know how the one child policy turned out in China, this book is informative and shocking to readers. But as a reader, you understand how a country wanted to control their population from spinning out of control. The government never thought about how and who would care for those growing older at a rapid rate and a birth rate lower than mortality rate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LFQC0ORSO2CT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054427539X#wasThisHelpful","R2LFQC0ORSO2CT","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Briers and Susan Hampshire play Hector and Molly MacDonald, the Lord and Lair in Scotland. When Richard's Hector has a minor accident, Molly calls for their prodigal son, Archie, to come home to the Highlands from London, England. In a British television season, 6 to 8 episodes are the norm so the cast also get to have acting jobs in theatre, movies, or other television shows. Richard Briers was a British television icon known for his offbeat humor but you can't help but love his character. Susan Hampshire is regal, classic and a wonderful actress as Lady of the Manor.Archie is well played by an up and coming actor. He does a terrific job in playing the conflicted character between his London life and his Scottish heritage. Katrina is also played well by the actress as the local teacher who has a crush on Archie. His London girlfriend and business partner, Justine, conflicts the situation in a love triangle. The eight episodes feature the on location in Scotland and it is majestic beauty. You just want to visit there. Glenbogle, Scotland is the total opposite of urban London, England.The show would last for a few more seasons. The first season includes 2 DVDs and includes a tour of the estate set for the location. The drama is melodramatic and there is light humor along the way as well. There are serious issues like Archie's late brother, Jamie, and his death; Katrina's paternity; and local politics.

Haley's ""Roots"" was about the African American family experience and history. Not only was it a runaway best seller but ""Roots"" became television history. Despite the script and book differences, the main message of ""Roots"" remains the same.Sadly the outcries and accusations about plagiarism hurts Alex Haley's legacy.

"""The Hurt Locker"" is a rare war film done by a female director named Kathryn Bigelow, James Cameron's ex wife. Bigelow has directed a war film about a team dismantling bombs in Iraq. Jeremy Renner leads the squad and his character has a record of dismantling bombs. Renner is terrific as the leader. His performance can be difficult to watch at times. He deserved his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. The rest of the cast do award winning performances as well.The film has difficult scenes to watch for the squeamish. War is hell onscreen and offscreen but you can't help watching this film. It is bleak but not hopeless. They filmed Iraq scenes in Jordan. The film is about two hours long but engrossing to watch in that span. The film won 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. Bigelow was the first female to win this award.In fact, Bigelow is my kind of female director. She does difficult topics like war rather than traditional female subjects. It is nice to see a female director in charge for a change and win accolades for it.My biggest complaint is the lack of features for this DVD. There is only one feature behind the making of the film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSVR88VA3OGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00275EGWY#wasThisHelpful","R1NSVR88VA3OGD","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Barbara Cook is an incredible songstress and vocalist of the master class. She teaches master lasses at Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She has been performing whether in a cabaret or on stage around the world. Her voice is a treasured gift to be shared by millions of fans.In this recording, it is based on a live performance at the famed Cafe Carlyle room with her accompanist and musical partner, Wally Harper. She and Wally have comprised a tribute to the late great Gower Champion, famed Broadway theatrical director who died on the opening of the big hit, ""42nd Street."" Barbara is also a master storyteller in telling us tidbits about Broadway and Gower's theatrical influence. Barbara tells heartwarming stories about life on the great white way.Thirty five years later, most listeners have never heard of Gower Champion and its a shame. I'm sure Gower is smiling in heaven. His spirit lives on in the shows. Barbara selects songs and sings them with passion, love, and joy.To me, Barbara Cook is simply one of the world's finest female vocalists. Any of her recordings are first rate and high quality of music. When Barbara sings, she raises the bar of singing to a higher almost spiritual level. When Barbara played Marian the Librarian in ""The Music Man,"" she became a Broadway star and a legend. Listening to this CD, you're right there in Cafe Carlyle with Barbara and Wally.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V8Q1JYXL5SO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000K2CR#wasThisHelpful","R1V8Q1JYXL5SO7","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About a week ago, I woke up and watched a chorus singing ""Jerusalem"" for a British celebration. I wanted more and I alread have Lesley Garrett's recording somewhere in my collection. This CD includes the soulful anthem written by Sir Hubert Parry among others.Still ""Jerusalem"" is my favorite albeit it is only two minutes long. The lyrics are from Milton Blake's poem. I do agree ""Jerusalem"" is better than ""God Save the Queen"" in sound and passion. The recording makes me long to to return to England for a visit or to live there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F1X51TYSZDFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00925TAQO#wasThisHelpful","R3F1X51TYSZDFG","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I sit and work at one laptop, I play a DVD on my second laptop. For the past several weeks, I have played all 12 DVDs from this collection. If you're looking for high quality, look elsewhere. These 12 DVDs features hundreds of classic cartoons from decades ago. Perhaps they were last seen on television about thirty years ago. The quality varies from cartoon to cartoon. Since many cartoons are decades old,they might have some quality issues from preservation or lack of preservation.Disc One features 30 ""Popeye"" and 22 ""Betty Boop"" Cartoons.Disc Two features 5 ""Tom & Jerry;"" 7 ""Mr. Piper;""14 ""The Three Stooges;"" 3 ""Caspar;"" 3 ""Herman;"" 4 ""Gabby;"" 3 ""Little Audrey;"" 2 ""Little Lulu;"" 2 ""Felix the Cat;"" and 3 ""Mr. Bang, Katrinka, The Skipper.""Disc Three features 53 Various Characters cartoons.Disc Four features 19 ""Betty Boop;"" 22 ""The Three Stooges;"" 8 ""Christmas cartoons;"" and 6 ""Other cartoons.""Disc Five features 5 ""Tom & Jerry;"" 8 ""Felix the Cat;"" 6 ""Popeye;"" 2 ""Caspar;"" 3 ""Gabby;"" 4 ""Little Lulu;"" 3 ""Oswald Rabbit;"" 2 ""Little Audrey;"" 1 ""Molly Moo-Cow;"" 3 ""Alice;"" and 7 Other cartoons.Disc Six features 6 ""Hunky & Spunky;"" 4 ""Pied Piper;"" and 41 Other cartoons.Disc Seven features 4 ""Calvin and the Colonel;"" 15 ""Clutch Cargo"" episodes; 10 ""Aesop's Fables;"" 11 ""Felix;"" 5 ""Space Angel;"" 2 ""Blackie the Lamb;"" 1 ""Snack, Crackle, & Pop;"" 1 ""Cinderella;"" and 1 ""Little Gray Neck.""Disc Eight features 9 ""Fraidy Cat;"" 14 ""Gumby;"" 24 ""Hoppity Hooper;"" 1 ""The Wizard of Oz;"" 1 ""Moonbird;"" and 1 ""Popeye.""Disc Nine features 12 ""Farmer Alfalfa;"" 6 ""Alice;"" 9 ""Wacky & Packy;"" 2 ""Herman the Mouse;"" 1 ""Cubby Bear as Brownie Bear;"" 6 ""Christmas Cartoons;"" and 15 Other Cartoons.Disc Ten includes 25 ""Colonel Bleep;"" 5 ""George Pal Puppertoons;"" 10 ""Mel-O-Toons;"" 9 ""Christmas Cartoons;"" and 1 ""Meany Miny and Moe"" cartoon.Disc Eleven includes 4 ""Calvin and the Colonel;"" 35 ""Clutch Cargo"" episodes;"" 3 ""Terrytoon;"" 1 ""Felix the Cat;"" and 7 Other cartoons.Disc Twelve includes 9 ""The Three Stooges;"" 16 ""Hoppity Hooper"" and 15 Other CartoonsIf you're looking for a specific old cartoon, you should be able to find it here. There are hundreds of memorable and even forgettable cartoons. They don't show them on television much and it's a shame.  Television programmers have forgotten the art of programming for younger audiences today. Otherwise, younger children would never be able to enjoy them if they're not exposed to them. If I could, I would probably look for DVDs including ""The Three Stooges"" and ""Popeye"" in cartoons.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CXI7GN5RS8Z8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002H047OG#wasThisHelpful","R3CXI7GN5RS8Z8","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dame Vera Lynn was the voice of England during its darkest days. She provided warmth, comfort, and perhaps hope during the London Blitz and the war against the German Nazis. France had Edith Piaf while England had Vera Lynn. She has become a British treasure and institution from a time gone by. She is still in her nineties and alive in England. This compilation includes classic hits like ""A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square;"" ""White Cliffs of Dover;"" and ""Til We Meet Again"" among them. There are others sung with heart and soul from a time gone by.In the nineties, Dame Vera Lynn returned to the stage to commemorate the golden anniversary of D-Day. She was awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) before she was awarded the Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her services to music. She carried a nation with her tune and sound. Her voice and songs remind listeners of life during World War II in England and the never ending threat of the Germans invading England by land invasion. The Germans dropped bombs but never invaded England by foot.Thank you, Dame Vera Lynn, for your voice and service during the war years. Your voice comforted millions living through it. She would go on to a successful singing career but she was at her peak of popularity during the war years. This compilation helps us understand how a voice can give hope in music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5FXG971UGMD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000WMI#wasThisHelpful","R5FXG971UGMD7","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This restaurant guide will help you navigate to the restaurants in New York City including all five boroughs. Each section includes a colorful map, colorful photographs, and descriptions about each restaurants. As somebody who lives near New York City, I would find this guide invaluable to dining out in the finest and established restaurants including newcomers to the restaurant scene.When I worked in New York City, I ate and walked a lot. There were so many restaurants to choose from around any location in Manhattan. This book includes restaurants in the outer boroughs like The Bronx; Brooklyn; Queens; and Staten Island. The guide includes bus and subway maps. The best way to see New York City is by bus rather than subways. There are indexes for cuisine and location. New York City is a gastronomic paradise for the ultimate foodie.

"Truman Capote was definitely a talented writer beset by inner demons and a conscience. He was never the same person after he wrote ""In Cold Blood."" This book is a collection of modest short stories previously published in magazines before he became a well-known published author. The foreword is written by Hilton Als (my advanced copy does not feature it but will be in the advanced final copy).The short stories in this collection are entitled ""Parting of the Way;"" ""Mill Story;"" ""Hilda;"" ""Miss Belle Rankin;"" ""If I Forget You;"" ""Swamp Terror;"" ""The Moth in the Flame;"" ""The Familiar Stranger;"" ""Louise;"" ""This Is In Jamie;"" ""Lucy;"" ""Traffic West;"" ""Kindred Spirits;"" and ""Where the World Begins."" The book ends with the author's biography and about the Truman Capote Literary Trust.If you are a Truman Capote fan, you must read his stories and want to purchase this book. The early stories are quite advanced for a young writer. He writes mostly about realistic characters in observational pieces. Each character like Louise is drawn to reflect Americana in some aspect. I enjoyed ""Louise"" but felt it was probably based on a real life experience. The first story, ""Parting of the Way,"" is about two young men and I wonder if they were lovers than friends (something not mainstreamed in literature of the time). ""Kindred Spirits"" has the least likable characters to me.If you want to read more about Truman Capote, this book is definitely a must read about his observational skills and poetic writing style in developing characters. Some stories needed to be reread in order to grasp the full understanding. I will be honest that I didn't care much for Truman Capote before this book. I found him to be unlikable after the film, ""Capote,"" about the ""In Cold Blood"" case. Much like his portrayer Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Capote had inner demons with drugs and alcohol and died prematurely in 1984.Now as I read his words, I feel sympathy and understanding for this complicated writer. Most writers with a genius talent often suffer from inner demons. Truman Capote may have been the life and joke of the party but he was deeply disturbed individual who needed help and understanding. He surrounded himself with the creme de la creme of society much like a jester in the palace. He wanted to be taken seriously and wanted his friends to see reality around him. He had a great knack for describing and writing about how people actually were in reality. Rest in Peace, Truman.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PRN78EYXDVHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998227#wasThisHelpful","R3PRN78EYXDVHX","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The children's book is about four sisters, Priscilla 'Silly,' twins Astrid and Eleanor, and Marla who live in suburban New Hampshire with their parents. Mom is usually bedridden from some undisclosed illness while Dad is basically in charge of the household. When the sisters discover magic in their bedroom closets, they uncover and unlock the key to some family secrets.The story overall is quite imaginative and realistic. Some young female readers will identify with the sisters and their situation. I just wished the writer focused more on the family secrets and less than on the imaginative world in their closets. Perhaps the author is trying to express that we all have secrets in my bedroom closets about our families.The Mom is the most important character in the story who needs to be better developed. As a reader, I felt that she was shades of a person in reality. The story is telling especially about reality and magic. Perhaps the last line is the most important in signaling the essence of the book's story. You can find magic in reality if you're looking in the right places for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGRRZSN2LSYA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062352717#wasThisHelpful","RGRRZSN2LSYA8","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sir John Hurt stars as Father Christopher, a Catholic priest at an UN school in Rwanda. Hugh Dancy plays a young British teacher. When the school becomes a place for the fleeing Rwandans, they have to make choices and decisions.Based on a true story about the ETO massacre, there are harrowing moments in the film with passing scenes of murdered bodies on the streets. I'll never forget how a father pleaded with the UN soldiers to kill all of them with guns rather than machetes. He even pleaded to kill the children rather than them face the machete.The horrors of the Rwandan genocide are retold here ten years after it happened. The DVD features a forty minute feature in the making of the film and the story. The DVD features a commercial for IRC.This film was filmed on location and Rwanda.

"This DVD is a compilation of short films featuring Emmy winners Steve Carrell and James Gandolfini among other well known actors and Paris Hilton. This DVD doesn't have any extra features. The compilation features short films with a common theme of characters finding themselves. Most short films are done by new film directors from film school or emerging on the scene.Don't expect brilliance here but just a different way of telling a story. In the first short film, ""Club Soda,"" stars Emmy winner James Gandolfini. It is about a young man and his conscience. The short is not the best film of the bunch but it is watchable. James Gandolfini displays his acting ability stretching from beyond his ""Soprano"" days. The role isn't a stretch but the film is worth watching just for his performance. He is a sorely missed actor today. He also produced the short film as well.The second short film features Emmy winner Steve Carrell in ""Street of Pain"" about memory and dodgeball. This short film is done without any dialogue and also features Emmy winner actor Eric Stonestreet before ""Modern Family.""The third short film entitled ""Member"" is about a group of young people driving in Los Angeles, California. I didn't get this short film of all. It is perhaps my least favorite in the bunch.The fourth short film entitled ""Life Makes Sense If You're Famous"" is about life in Hollywood, California and about fame. I found it troublesome and confusing. There was too much going on in a short film.The fifth short film entitled ""L.A. Knights"" stars Paris Hilton in a short about finding love and relationships in Los Angeles, California. She pretty much plays herself in the role. It is a forgettable short though but she tries to act.The sixth and final short film is perhaps the best of the bunch about a young woman who fails at suicide and hates her job. Although filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, this short film feature Ioan Gruffudd in the role as a young man also on the verge of suicide. The story is the best for its simplicity and realism.The DVD doesn't feature any extra features. If you're interested in seeing actors like Steve Carrell, James Gandolfini, Josh Hartnett, Paul Walker, Paris Hilton, and others in short films that are rarely available elsewhere, this DVD is perfect for you. This compilation of short films would be hard elsewhere.This DVD compilation of short films might be ideal for film students to see how a variety of short films are done. The common theme here is about characters finding themselves in the world. My favorite short was the last and it was perfect.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EKXVQ0RX0V26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00555ZTRY#wasThisHelpful","R3EKXVQ0RX0V26","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This children's book is about the animals that live at a school during the nighttime hours when the school is closed. The classroom animals include Malcolm and his friends solving the mystery of the gold coin at McKenna School. The novel has its moments and the book should include more illustrations to help enhance the reader's imagination. There are few in my copy and I hope the final copy features much more illustrations. The mystery and the Gold Coin is about the school itself.The writing needs to be edited down for younger readers while I found the story to be enchanted at times and redundant and repetitive at other times. The story of animals at a school when nobody is around is quite genuine. You have to wonder what the animals do when nobody is around to watch them. They have a life of their own. I enjoyed the rabbit most of all.This book has some issues but they can be resolved with more illustrations and better editing to cut down on the repetitiveness and redundancy.

"Ryan Phillippe played Jersey City young man, Shane, who seeks a better life in New York City at Club 54. Mike Myers plays gay owner Steve Rubell with substance and sympathy. You feel sorry for him. Despite his wealth and fame, he was a very lonely man. Myers does a brilliant subtle job in playing Steve Rubell with complexity. You forgot he also played Austin Powers. In fact, his Austin Powers co-star Michael York has a role in the film as ambassador. There was plenty of well-known familiar faces like Sela Ward, Lauren Hutton, Mary McCormack, and Ellen Albertini Dow as Disco Dottie.Through Shane, we see how he gets in and stays in the club until it gets shut down. Club 54 was synonymous with fame and fortune. Anybody who was anybody was at 54 in those days. Selma Hayek and Breckin Meyer plays a married couple who befriend Shane. Neve Campbell plays a soap opera actress trying to achieve fame and fortune as an actress. There are actors playing 54 regulars like Andy Warhol and Truman Capote. I wished they utilized ER's Sherry Stringfield's ""Viv"" more in the film. She is barely recognizable in the role and is wasted in it.The film does an adequate job in recreating history of New York City in the late seventies. To see the twin towers is haunting enough. They filmed this movie in 1998. The film recreates the grittiness and character of New York City in those days. In fact, New York City was a place where it was possible to live and work in the city. Today, the city has become expensive and unaffordable for the working class unless you move to the outer boroughs.I felt the DVD could have had more features. They only show a music video. I also felt the writing could have been stronger too. Still the movie recreates a life and times of New York City's notorious club 54 and the era.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PUJOCGOSX5TT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SEUJXM#wasThisHelpful","R2PUJOCGOSX5TT","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that even though I had trouble following the storyline. I had trouble distinguishing between Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper in the film. They looked so much alike that they could be brothers even twins. I wasn't sure who was Irvin or Richie. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are superb in their roles. Jeremy Renner plays Mayor Carnine Polito, the Camden mayor who loved his family, wife, and city despite being corrupt. Louis C.K. is memorable in his role and I was trying to figure out who he was throughout the film. While at times, I felt Jennifer Lawrence was miscast for the role. She was too young to play Irvin's wife, Rosalyn. Amy Adams is superb as the mistress, con-artist, and player.The cast is superb. I enjoy the art direction, costumes, music and the actors. I just had trouble with the storyline though. I wasn't sure who was conning who at times. Perhaps it was because Bradley Cooper and Christian Bale looked more like brothers and twins than adversaries.The DVD has two notable features such as the making of the film and the deleted and extended scenes as well. Despite some flaws, I found the film entertaining overall. I wished they included a background feature to explain the actual events that occurred. The con was called ""Abscam"" to target corrupt politicians and officials.

They were the singing trio of sisters featuring Jocelyn better known as Joy; Babette; and Teddy. Babette and Teddy are identical twins born three years exactly after Joy's birth. The three sisters are the longest running musical trio in music history. Their own daughters have also emerged as the Foxes.The Beverley Sisters performed fondly World War II songs here with the Syd Lawrence Orchestra. They have earned many fans and gained popularity among the gay community. They have each been honored by the Queen with an MBE (Members of the Order of the British Empire). The Beverley Sisters are blonde, harmonious, and dress identically. This CD will thrill and send chills down your spins in remembering Britain's past during World War II.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RBUGTSLZ201B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00514K7XK#wasThisHelpful","R2RBUGTSLZ201B","A303U1MOXG5R1F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A303U1MOXG5R1F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm one of those people that uses gift bags for most presents I give people. I just find them way more convenient. There's no point in me taking my time to wrap presents anymore since everyone will rip them open anyway. I don't want just any cheap gift bag though. I want nice high quality gift bags that look beautiful under the Christmas tree. That's where these come in. Seriously, I was super impressed when these came in the mail. You get 12 bags with 8 assorted designs. The bags are nice and thick so I don't have to worry about them ripping or tearing and I can easily place heavier items in them. The bags are absolutely gorgeous though. They have glitter accents on each bag that makes them look very elegant. The glitter doesn't fall off and get all over the place too like some bags I have gotten in the past. Each bags ribbon handle matches the color theme of the bag perfectly too. You seriously cannot beat this deal for 12 large bags that measure 13"" h, 10"" h, and 5.5""w. I usually purchase my bags at a large retailer for $4 each but getting these delivered right to my door was more convenient. I'm pretty happy with these and definitely wouldn't hesitate to purchase more next year for Christmas if I end up using all of these this year. *I received this product free in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38X70VFUE961D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017T8P582#wasThisHelpful","R38X70VFUE961D","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a super cute and comfortable set. I love how it is true to size just like all the other Hers by Herman sets I have. The band on the bra is very comfortable compared to many bras that I have. The bra offers pretty good support for my size 38C chest. I love how this set comes with both a thong and bikini pantie in the same design as the bra so you can match with both styles. My favorite is the bikini though. They are very comfortable and sexy to wear. They are kind of like a cheekini look where they don't completely cover your bottom which are my favorite style from Victoria's Secret.

"My dog loves blankets. She is always taking mine. She always curls up on the couch laying on mine and snuggling with them. This blanket was perfect for her as it's her very own. I love the paw print design on this fleece blanket as well as the colors. The blanket is is very nice size and it's not too heavy where I get overheated or too thin. It's perfect for year round to enjoy in Louisiana weather. It is very soft and comfortable to drape over my lap so my dog can cuddle with me on the couch. I left the blanket out on the couch the other night and caught the cat curled up on it so she definitely enjoys it too. I've already washed it once and it has not lost it's softness or thickness at all. No threads have come apart and it's still all intact. I'm definitely happy I got this blanket.

"My husband has been trying out many different Syma helicopters lately. This is the first Chinook style he's flown. This one seemed to take a bit more getting used to. As soon as you would get it off the ground it would want to go forward instead of just up even when not using the forward or back controls. Takes a bit of getting used to but it definitely helps with hand/eye coordination. This Syma S026G definitely can take a beating though. It ran into walls, smashed into the corner of the television, and crashed to the floor multiple times and still got right back up to fly. That's what makes these totally worth it. It's great for a beginner or advanced flyer alike. My husband really enjoys the time he spends flying this around the living room and dining room and practicing his landing skills on his Eagle Pro Helipad which is available here:Remote Control Helicopter Landing Pad - LED Lights Installed - Suitable for RC Helicopters, Quadcopters, Drones, Syma Helicopters.. He knows he has finally controlled his helicopters once he can successfully land on his helipad. All in all, this mini Chinook style Syma is a great little helicopter for all ages. It charges quickly and gives you a solid 7 minutes of fly time with a few crashes here and there. I also like the flashing LED lights on the bottom of it. It adds a nice visual effect. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SEIQ9VHK1SNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HN70GM#wasThisHelpful","R3SEIQ9VHK1SNH","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am loving this Blueberry Pet Houndstooth pattern collar. It is very well made and solid. The stitching is perfect and precise. It's very easy to adjust as well as open and close. The collar is soft and padded and doesn't bother my dog at all. My dog usually never wears a collar because they always bothered her and she would just itch and scratch so much. This is padded and gentle enough and she actually seems to like wearing it around the house. I like the added little loop sewn into the Blueberry Pet label so I can add her dog tag or a charm.

"This is such an adorable little sweater and I was so excited to receive it and put it on my dog. I measured her to make sure I got the proper size. She is a 35 pound Border Collie/Beagle mix. When I got the sweater and put it on her it seemed like it was too big for her but I know I measured her correctly and it was the right size. It hangs over the back of her a little. The leg holes also seemed to be too low for heron the shoulder area. She started walking funny once I finished putting it on and I was trying to adjust it to get her more comfortable in it. I think maybe my dog is just built weird because I see all the other reviewers dogs fit into this sweater perfectly. The hood is an adorable addition to this sweater though especially with the little ball on the top of it. The sweater is very soft and warm and will definitely get many compliments. The hole on the top of the neck area is perfect so you can have a leash attached to a collar underneath it. Other than my dog being built funny this sweater is adorable and I really do love it.

"I love these collapsible silicone pet bowls. They are so convenient for travel and to keep around in case of emergencies. I like to keep some in the car along with some water bottles for when we go on trips. The bowls fit into the glove compartment or the back on the seats without taking up any room. When I'm ready to use them they easily pop up and I can fill them with my dogs food or water. When I'm done they collapse easily and effortlessly. They are perfect for taking with us on road trips and bringing into hotels. My dog only eats half a cup of food twice a day so her food fits perfectly at each meal. They also hold plenty of water for my dog to drink while we are traveling. She is a 34lb. Border Collie/Beagle mix for reference. My dog does not make any messes while eating or drinking from these and does not flip them over like I saw another review mention. I have had no problems with these bowls.

"This is a great grooming mitt and my dog seems to really enjoy it. She was moving around and letting me know exactly what spots to pet while I was using this. She really liked the soft little bristles on it. The mitt did grab some hair and kept it in the mitt. It was also very easy to clean and remove. I think it would be better for a short haired animal though as it didn't get completely under all of her fur since it's medium length. I also like that the other side of the mitt, the red side, is kind of like a lint brush. After I groom my dog and there are stray hairs on her I can go over her with the red side and it picks up those hairs for me. It's also great at removing her hair from my clothing and the couch!! I love that as every time I brush her the hair always manages to end up on me. For me, the mitt was very comfortable on my hand. The wrist part Velcros so it can fit anyone securely. It also has a strap on the inside so I can put my hand under it to get a better grip so my hand doesn't just slip around all over the place. It can also be used for anyone left or right handed which is great. So far I'm liking this grooming mitt. Every time I grab it my dog starts wagging her tail and comes right up to me because she knows it means she's getting petted with it! *sample provided for testing and review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17K3S1RHF68WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q1657Y#wasThisHelpful","R17K3S1RHF68WM","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They have a great opacity to them and they are very easy to mix to get new desired colors. I like that I can water them down or make them thicker with acrylic media or pastes. These are really conventional. The drying time is very convenient on both regular thick paper and canvas. They don't bleed, drip, or anything.

"If you're looking for a high quality flat iron but don't want to spend a ton of money this is definitely the one to get. I am extremely surprised with this flat iron. I have tried many over the years as a Cosmetologist that have ranged in price all the way up to $300. This one definitely gives those expensive salon brands some competition. I don't even have to turn this flat iron all the way to the highest temperature and I get great results. I love that it has adjustable settings instead of just one universal setting at 410 degrees which damages so many peoples hair. The ceramic plates heat quickly and evenly and do not cool down while you're using it. This flat iron makes my hair very soft, silky, and shiny. It doesn't pull, tug, or rip at the ends of my hair at all which is a huge plus. It's great for my long thick hair. I can take bigger pieces of hair and straighten it a lot quicker than with other ones I've used in the past. I'm able to straight and curl my hair easily with this because of the design of it too. The outside isn't flat and it has a nice round shape to it so you can easily create some nice curls.

"I love this aromatherapy diffuser. It's got a beautiful design, it's a pretty big 120ml size, it's very easy to operate, and the lights change colors. It holds 100ml of water which lasts quite a long time. I love that it has an auto shut off so I can fall asleep with it on and not have to worry about it running dry. It also has an option to run for 30 seconds, shut off for 30 seconds, and then run again for 30 seconds which I found really interesting. The diffuser is also very quiet while it's running. I also absolutely love the color changes. They are beautiful to look at and there's also an option to have the colors on bright or a dimmer setting. I also have the option of picking what color to put on instead of having the colors rotate or you can have them change. If you have a child you can have them pick their favorite color and it's very easy to press the button and go to each color setting.

I know I need to use them longer before I see a bigger improvement but I'm glad to see that I have not experienced any redness or burning. My skin does feel smoother and I do notice the little bumps are disappearing. (The bumps on my skin that were never pimples, just uneven texture.) These pads can be a bit drying though since they tighten the skin so I just use a nighttime moisturizer afterwards and it's fine. I haven't experienced any drastic peeling though which I absolutely hate and have experienced with many acne pads that always made me discontinue use. I'm definitely liking the results so far and will continue to use these. 50 pads is almost two months worth with once a day use. Since I have sensitive skin I didn't want to use them more than that, especially for the price if I end up liking them and needing more! *I received this product free in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJWEWWCSKE8RC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMOS058#wasThisHelpful","RJWEWWCSKE8RC","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These candles are absolutely divine! Upon opening and smelling each one I was instantly filled with this satisfaction of a sweet aroma. They smell absolutely delicious and do not have an artificial smell to them. The candles are a very generous size at 8 ounces especially because you don't need much wax at all once melted to massage with. I lit the ""Fig & Brown Sugar"" candle and waited a few minutes. I couldn't wait any longer to test it  because it smelled so delicious so I had to blow it out! The candle has a great throw, very therapeutic and makes you feel like you're in a luxurious spa. Now, I wish my husband was giving me a back massage but he's working. I dipped my finger in the wax and put it right on the inside of my arm. It was warm and felt quite relaxing. You can also just pour the wax directly from the tin to your body if desired. The wax doesn't burn and feels very nice. Rubbed in it is moisturizing without a greasy feeling. The Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Vitamins A, Vitamin E and Omega 3 Oils help to moisturize and nourish the skin which is a great benefit of these candles. It penetrated into my skin nicely without leaving any sticky mess behind.These candles are perfect for a romantic couples massage between you and your partner or even just to use for a nice candlelit bath by yourself. They smell amazing, my skin felt great afterwards, and they are made in the USA. Each candle will definitely last a long time and I love the tins they come in. I definitely recommend these for gifts or to pick up for yourself. I am hooked! *samples provided free for testing and review purposes*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C0VVYM7FSOJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0109OO1E2#wasThisHelpful","R2C0VVYM7FSOJ8","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great Harlequin thigh highs. I was worried these wouldn't fit me because usually ""one size"" items end up being too small on me but they did fit fine. I'm 5'4 and usually wear a L/XL in pants.

"This is a fantastic dual shower head. I've always wanted one of these and this one is perfect. I love how it has five different functions to pick from. My husband loves the more pressurized water from the rain/aeration selection while I like the rain and massage selections. I also love that you can use both shower heads at once or one at a time. The flow is perfect on both shower heads. This was very easy to install in the shower and only took my husband a few minutes to switch from our other shower head to this one. The ABS plastic material with a chrome finish is very solid and made well. The finish is very shiny and definitely makes it look like a luxurious chrome shower head. So far I've been using this for about three weeks and my husband and I both enjoy it.

"These hammock tree straps go great with the hammock I just got. These are very solid, strong, and durable. The stitching is excellent! The straps are lightweight and easy to carry along in a backpack for a hiking or camping trip. It was very easy to wrap these straps around many different sized trees. The straps give plenty of room and they are very long so you aren't restricted to certain trees or you don't have to go hunting for trees that are a specific distance away from each other. They are so simple and very convenient to have along with my Petrichor portable hammock. *I received this product free for testing and review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNJVK7DR67YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ELU6L2#wasThisHelpful","R3RNJVK7DR67YC","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have been looking at cute signs and decals for the walls but have never settled on one. I am so glad I got this one. It's a nice size and it's very cute. The ""Sorting Out Life One Load At A Time"" fits perfectly in the laundry room and makes me laugh. The sign was easy to hang and has two holes on the back for nails to go into.

"This is the cutest mason jar soap dispenser. It has such a vintage DIY look to it. The quality of it is excellent. The glass is very thick, much thicker than a regular mason jar. The stainless steel pump is beautiful and shiny. It is very easy to pump soap out of this dispenser. It dispenses just the perfect amount of soap when you press down on it. It took me a while to decide exactly what kind of soap to put in it because I wanted it to look perfect and didn't want to pick a soap that would be too thick and clog it up. I ended up putting some Soft Soap in it and it worked perfectly. The dispenser instantly added a gorgeous touch to my guest bathroom vanity. I am so impressed with the quality of this dispenser and am so happy that I have this. It is much better than a boring plastic soap dispenser from the store. It would also make for the perfect gift.

"This is an awesome little outdoor speaker with an even cooler design! It has a very impressive sound to it and the quality is impressive. It gets loud enough to where my husband can easily be working on his boat outside and can still enjoy music even while using power tools that would usually drown out other speakers. My husband actually hooked it up on a carabiner and let it hang off his back belt loop so the music could follow him while he was working in the yard. The speaker is very lightweight which makes it perfect for portability. The bass on this speaker is excellent for the size of it. Connecting this to our iPhone 6 Plus' took just a few seconds. It connected with no problems at all. I also like that is has an AUX hookup in case you wanted to use an iPod or other device that doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities. This is the perfect speaker for camping, going to the beach, or other outdoor activities because it's waterproof. It charges pretty quickly and the battery life is pretty long too at about 6 hours of play time. So far, we are loving this speaker. My husband grabs it every time he goes outside. It's rugged, waterproof, and has great sound. There is nothing negative about this speaker I can say. *product provided free for testing and review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E6KEGNSBJ8CP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013K28IWG#wasThisHelpful","R2E6KEGNSBJ8CP","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hammock is very impressive It's so lightweight but it can hold up to 265lbs. It's a very durable polyester. The hammock is perfect for taking on camping or backpacking trips as it's very portable. It comes in a small little attached sack that can easily fit in a backpack. It's extremely easy to set up too. This is a very convenient hammock to have around and is made very well. The hammock measures 8 feet 6 inches long and is 4 feet 6 inches wide so it is very roomy and comfortable. You're able to relax in it and not worry about making one small move and falling over. The best part about this is the price as it's very budget friendly.

"These are great stainless steel coffee scoops. They are one tablespoon and that is just enough to fill a reusable k-cup pod with the perfect amount of coffee. The spoons are solid and very durable.

"These curtains are fantastic. on my computer screen the blue ones looked more of a silver-ish blue but once I received them they are definitely more light blue colored. They are very nice curtains, well made, and solid. They aren't very thin but they let just the right amount of light into my spare bedroom. If I have my blinds open in the room they will still give enough privacy and people wouldn't be able to peak into the bedroom and see everything that was going on. The large grommets on the top of the curtains make it easy for them to glide open and closed across my curtain rod. The grommets are securely attached to the curtains and I have noticed no loose threads. The embroidered leaf design on the panels adds a beautiful elegance to the panels that I just really enjoy. I love that I get two panels in this set for such an affordable price. Typically I would be paying this price for one cheap panel at any big name store.

"This 12 piece makeup brush set from Nuturu is fantastic. It includes every brush you need to create the perfect daily makeup look. The brushes came in a nicely size, perfect for travel case that looks very sleek and professional. While not traveling the case is perfect to have the brushes displayed on top of my vanity ready for me to grab. The brushes themselves are very soft with dense bristles. The ferrules are strong on them and are not loose at all. I love every single brush in this set. I can easily create an every day eye look or a more drastic smokey eye with the brushes included. I love the tapered blending brush in this set. It is the perfect size. The angled contour brush is perfect for applying blush, highlight, or contouring. The brushes all pick up a good amount of powder and don't waste much or create a lot of unnecessary fallout. While washing the brushes I didn't lose tons of hairs either which was great. The brushes cleaned very well and maintained their normal shape and softness after drying. So far I am very happy with this brush set and highly recommend it.

"These peach scented silicone dish scrubbers are awesome! Right out of the package I could smell the peach scent. The scrubbers are soft and gentle enough to not scratch my pots and pans but they remove all the baked on stuff without me sitting there scrubbing forever! These are really flexible and are easy to maneuver into the corners of my dishes to get every little piece of baked on food. I love that these scrubbers are made with silicone so they don't harbor any bacteria that creates mold and mildew. I don't have to worry about mold developing inside these! I also don't notice any gross pieces of food getting stuck inside these either which I notice with other scrub sponges.

"There are two things I absolutely love right here: candles and pumpkin pie. I am a major candle fiend and have one burning in the house daily. When I look for candles I like ones that have a strong throw so they fill up my main living area. This candle definitely delivers not only in appearance but in fragrance. As soon as I opened the box my nose was over joyed with the delicious aroma of pumpkin pie while this candle was still wrapped in plastic! The candle is absolutely adorable and looks so good. I set this candle on my table for a few days, still in the plastic wrap, and every single time I walk by I smell it from 5 feet away! Even with my Yankee Candles or Bath & Body Works candles I have to put my nose right up to them to get that cold sniff. As soon as I took the plastic wrap off and lit it the aroma was even better. This is the perfect candle for fall. It is so inviting, so delicious, and instantly perks my mood up. It reminds me of Thanksgiving, of that pumpkin pie baking in the oven for dessert. It is not an artificial pumpkin pie smell at all. To me, it is authentic and that is what I love so much about it! The candle burns slowly too which means it'll last me a long time. I almost didn't even want to burn it because it looked so beautiful but as soon as I smelled it I had to and I do not regret it. The throw of this candle is worth more than 5 stars. I can smell this candle all the way down my hallway and into my bedroom where I have never been able to smell any other candle that was burning in my dining room.This is definitely a must have candle for fall and I am so glad I have this in my home. I absolutely love this candle. *discount received for testing and review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V63SU2A3WCOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LTY54M#wasThisHelpful","R1V63SU2A3WCOB","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I usually use Joico K-Pak shampoo but decided to give this a try. I've been using it every time I wash my hair (which is about every three days) for the past few weeks. So far I'm impressed with how it makes my hair feel. It makes my hair feel very soft and manageable. I notice once blow dried or even air dried it is less frizzy. There is so much shine to my hair and my hands glide through it that I constantly find myself running my fingers through my hair lately. This is a great sulfate free shampoo that is safe for color treated hair. The Argan oil nourishes my hair and protects my color which is a plus. I don't even use conditioner with this shampoo and still find my hair nice and soft. The only draw back for me is the price.

"This is just what my husband needed. As a construction worker he works with his hands and heavy machinery all day. Wearing a normal metal ring in his line of work could be very dangerous. He has watched some friends get their hands caught by their rings and the results weren't pretty. We then decided he needed to switch his wedding ring to a silicone one. He had another one before this one but he ended up losing a bit of weight in his hands and it became too big. This was the perfect replacement. I love the infinity symbol on the ring so much. It just means so much to both of us like our love will go on forever. The ring fit him perfectly and is very comfortable. He can easily do everything he needs to at work without worrying about anything happening because this ring is silicone where as a traditional wedding ring is metal and would conduct electricity which would be very dangerous. I love that this ring will break away at 40lbs. of pressure too which is a great safety feature of it. This a great alternative to traditional metal rings in certain job fields while still being able to wear a ring! I love that my husband is happy to wear it proudly at work and that he has this option available to him. These are very affordable and highly recommended.

"This book is jam packed with tons of information on herbal medicine. There is a lot of great stuff to learn in here. I have always hated taking prescription and over the counter drugs so I really like reading about more natural ways to take care of things. This book has definitely taught me some things just looking over it in the past week. It includes 200 recipes for face and hair care, body and skin care, intimate care, mental health and wellness, common ailments, home cleaning products, and self-care. A lot of the recipes are so easy to make too. They are so much more natural and better for you than drugs filled with harmful chemicals. The book also touches on Aromatherapy which I recently got into. This book pretty much will help heal you from the inside out. I am really excited about it. I did get a bit overwhelmed with information but I think pacing myself with the book will be a good thing. I don't need to read it from front to back right away because there is tons of information but I truly do enjoy grabbing it and reading through it a little bit at a time.

"This UV flashlight couldn't have came at a more perfect time. I noticed a strong cat urine odor in our bedroom and was looking all over the place for it. I used this light and checked everywhere. I wasn't finding anything until I looked under the bed. Two big spots of yellow just lit up super bright on the hardwood floor. With just the regular bedroom light on those spots were not visible at all. This light made them very bright, very florescent, and easily noticeable. After taking the cat to the vet and finding out she had a UTI this light has been very helpful the past few days as she continues to urinate under the bed. Now I can find the spots easily instead of waiting for the strong odor to start. It's a great light and the textured grip is also very comfortable to hold. I had another UV light similar to it but it wasn't as bright as this one. This one you don't have to get extremely close to the spot. I can easily walk around the room with the light and check without getting on my hands and knees or bending over trying to get close to where I think a spot could be. This is a great light to find pet urine spots and even after cleaning the area with Nature's Miracle I can go back with this light to ensure I got every last bit of the mess! *I received this product free in exchange for my honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HRBFKF36GO3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFR5E68#wasThisHelpful","R3HRBFKF36GO3B","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Sodynee acrylic makeup organizer is absolutely beautiful. The acrylic is crystal clear with no scratches at all. I love that it comes in two pieces with the top organizer easily removable. The drawers glide open so easily and the handles are just the right size to grab. I love the included removable mesh liner inside the drawers to prevent either makeup or jewelry from sliding around in the drawers. It keeps everything nice and organized.  The drawers are the perfect size for my everyday eye shadow palettes or blushes. I can easily fit one or two shadow palettes depending on the size of them. The top can be used for so many different things from foundations, primers, blushes, moisturizers, lip glosses, mascaras, truly anything you can think of. That is why I love this organizer. You can put anything you want in it. It is absolutely perfect for your go-to makeup items that you typically grab for. No more digging through my drawers. I can easily keep everything I love right in this acrylic organizer on top of my vanity. It goes great with any decor because it's clear and it looks so fabulous. It's made very well and completely solid. I honestly don't have a single complaint about this organizer. I couldn't be happier with it. *I received this product free in exchange for my honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA5NKPAN16A61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125XN15K#wasThisHelpful","RA5NKPAN16A61","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is exactly what I was looking for!! It has everything I needed to learn about all the uses for coconut oil from cooking with it in many different ways including baking cookies, coconut oil uses for the skin, and seriously so much more. This book is jam packed. It tells you the different types of coconut oils, their benefits, and exactly what oils are best for what. There are so many different coconut oils on the shelves at the store and this book will help you pick exactly what one is best for you. I always wondered what the difference between fractionated and un-fractionated coconut oil was and why it was so important to get the un-fractionated oil to use on my skin. Now I know! This book has given me so many DIY ideas and recipes to make my own beauty products which will save me money and be much more natural. The photos in the book are beautiful, the writing is done well, and I have thoroughly enjoyed looking through this book. This is definitely a great read and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning about the many different uses of coconut oil and the history behind it. *I received this product free in exchange for my honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMAFWVT4EA906/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942411065#wasThisHelpful","RMAFWVT4EA906","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited to get this pet carrier for my cat because it's so hard getting her into a hard crate to take to the vet. I was really disappointed in the size when it arrived. I ordered the medium and it says it's for pets up to 10 pounds. My cat is only 7 pounds so I figured that would allow her some sort of wiggle room. She barely fit in it. Once I zipped it shut she didn't have much space on the sides or above her. This would have been perfect for a vet appointment because she actually had walked right into it herself as it looks much less intimidating than a hard crate. The carrier is nice though and would be great if it were larger. I think the large size would be more suitable for her, even though this one should have worked since she is three pounds under the limit. I did like that it included the soft fleece bed. The choice of handles or a shoulder strap is nice. All the zippers work well and I LOVED that the zippers included a buckle to secure them once they were zipped together to give them extra security. I also like that it has a seat belt loop so you can safely secure the carrier during car trips to the vet. I unfortunately did not get to test that today when I went to the vet. I had to opt for my hard carrier. The screens are great so the pet inside can easily see its surroundings all around. This is still a nice quality carrier and may come in handy in the future if I ever add another kitten to the family. *discount received for testing and review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VRCITPBJFOPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6XRMXK#wasThisHelpful","R1VRCITPBJFOPM","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to the other reviews it seems like the sizing of these polos is a bit inconsistent. I ordered my husband an X-Large and it ended up being way too big for him by about two sizes. The quality of the shirt is nice though. The collar is perfect, the buttons are nice, and the material is great. The shirt is very affordable too so I wish I had gotten the right size. My husband did say the shirt was comfortable though when he tried it on so if it was his size this shirt would have been great. It is a very nice casual polo that would go great with some jeans.

"I just recently learned many different benefits of coconut oil so I was really excited for this two pack of Nutiva Organic Virgin Coconut Oil. As soon as I opened a jar the smell of this stuff was absolutely amazing. Seriously, it smells delicious. I started trying coconut oil as a moisturizer on my dry skin recently and found out that was a great natural alternative to lotion! It's also great for your hair as a deep conditioner. Coconut oil also removes my eye makeup easily and effortlessly without damaging my lashes. It's also great at whitening your teeth *oil pulling* .. One of my favorite uses is cooking with it. It is so much healthier to cook with this oil instead of uses tons of butter. This oil makes everything taste so much better too. It changes the flavor and I couldn't believe the difference. I can't wait to figure out different ways to cook with this stuff and to replace butter more often. This is so much healthier. I just love the aroma of coconut oil in the kitchen too.

"This emoji pillow makes me laugh when I look at it. The pillow is very soft and made quite well. It's the perfect gift for a child, teenager, or young adult to enjoy. I actually got it for my niece and she absolutely loves it. These emojis are getting so popular and this was perfect for her. She thought it was so funny! The pillow is a nice size at a little over a foot in diameter. There is no care tag on this pillow though so I don't know how my niece will go about cleaning it if it were ever to get dirty.

"This Sherpa and micro plush throw blanket is fantastic. It is a little thin but I actually like it that way. I live in Louisiana and it doesn't get extremely cold here but I still love having a blanket wrapped around me. This was just perfect and what I needed. It is extremely soft and feels so comfortable to be wrapped in. I got the white one and I'm glad it's easily washable because it gets covered in dog and cat hair very quickly because both animals love this blanket as well. For the price, it serves its purpose here. It's not super thick which is not what I wanted since it doesn't get very cold here. It has been washed a few times and so far it has held up well.

"This is by far the coolest thermometer I have ever used. As an adult, when I'm sick I absolutely hate having to put a thermometer under my tongue for a minute especially when I can't breathe through my nose. This thermometer is perfect for all ages, not just for children and infants. The fact that it's a forehead thermometer and ear thermometer in one is awesome. It means you don't have to buy multiple devices and saves money and drawer space. Right out of the box it was easy to use especially since it came with batteries. The readings are pretty accurate too with infra-red technology. I did a reading on my forehead and then one in my own ear and they both gave the same exact temperature. Now, since I don't have a high temp at the moment I wasn't able to see the red back light but I find that feature to be really cool. If you're in the normal temperature range the LED back light will be green. If you have a high temperature the LED back light will be red and there will be an alarm that beeps. I also like that this stores up to 20 readings to you can monitor someones temperature during a sickness. This is great for those quick readings. I will never use the under the tongue thermometer again thanks to this. *discount received for testing and review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q1GTVO60TPFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010E2ZONQ#wasThisHelpful","R1Q1GTVO60TPFL","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic candle. I have always wanted to try a massage oil candle and I am so glad this was the brand I tried. These candles are absolutely amazing. As soon as you open the box, this delicious gardenia smell took over my senses. The size of this candle is very generous at 10 ounces. The candle is naturally made with soy way, essential oils. aloe, and vitamin E. This candle can be used to enjoy a relaxing candle lit bubble bath or be used as a moisturizing massage oil. The candle burns slowly so it'll last quite a while. The candle burns very nicely and evenly too which is nice. I always hate when candles don't burn easily or end up tunneling. This one formed the perfect pool. I tested the wax and it feels so ridiculously good once it touches the skin. It's so warm and not hot at all. It's just the right temperature for a relaxing massage from a partner or just for yourself to massage into your hands or feet. It is also very moisturizing and does penetrate into the skin.

"This is a fantastic bamboo pillow with shredded memory foam. My husband instantly claimed this pillow for himself. Once it arrives in the mail it comes completely flat and rolled up. You must open it up and allow it to fluff up for a bit first. This pillow didn't take long at all to completely form its full pillow shape. It was ready to use within an hour or two! The pillow is dense but very soft. Your head just rests in it so easily, like laying on a cloud, if this is what a cloud felt like. The quality of this pillow is superior. I actually noticed my husband snored less while using this pillow. Thank goodness!! I love that this pillow is hypoallergenic and the cover is easily removable and machine washable in cold water. This pillow is perfect for my husband as he sleeps on his side and his back mostly. He said that this pillow has relieved his neck pain that is associated with working 10 hour days as a pipe fitter.

"I absolutely love this microfiber towel. I am a huge fan of microfiber. It absorbs water quicker and is better for your hair. Plus the towel is so much lighter than a regular towel! This is smaller than a regular bath towel so it wasn't a giant bulky thing on top of my head which was nice. Usually regular towels cause neck strain on me. This did not. Now, I do have longer hair and unfortunately this did not hold all my hair in it so I can't wrap it around my head and keep it on for a while. It fell off a few times. But from the moment I stepped out of the shower with soaking wet hair I instantly took this towel and just gently squeezed my hair into it a few times and the amount of water the towel absorbed was impressive. My hair was no longer dripping wet and I wouldn't even need to wrap my hair if I didn't want to. Overall, it's a fantastic towel. It's very soft, very well made, and it dries very quickly.

"This is seriously the coolest quick draw gun magnet ever. As soon as I opened the box this magnet was in it grabbed the scissors I used to open the box. This magnet is VERY powerful. It was in a white envelope in the box so I had no idea what it was force-ably magnetizing my scissors from my hands. Moving on. My husband decided to install the magnet above the our headboard in the bedroom. It was easy to install. Just two simple screws. We tested out a few different guns. Our KSG wasn't able to be held by it because the gun was too slick. AR-15 held up PERFECTLY! Hand guns were held up easily as well. The magnet holding up the AR-15 was impressive. It does say it holds up to 25 LBS. which  an AR isn't nearly that heavy but it was nice to be able to have it handy right next to the bed mounted on the wall in case of an intruder. The release from the magnet is very easy. I had no trouble grabbing a gun and pulling it away (with some force) but the magnet is powerful enough to hold the gun in place and you do not have to worry about the gun falling. Only when pulling at the gun will it come off this magnet. Overall, my husband and I were both very impressed with this magnet. We are a bit worried about the strength of the magnet possibly damaging weapons and possibly scratching them so I may add some felt or some foam to the front of it for some extra protection. Guns slam against it quickly and I'd rather not bang up costly guns. *discount received for testing and review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF0ZYGKW5ZLUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJLA96A#wasThisHelpful","RF0ZYGKW5ZLUQ","A15VIPFO0VXPTL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15VIPFO0VXPTL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let's face it: JURASSIC PARK rocked, the sequels were...meh. THE LOST WORLD was fun, and the third was essentially a waste of 90 minutes, despite Sam Neill and William H. Macy somehow being in the mix. So my expectations for JURASSIC WORLD, the continuation of a franchise that shaped my childhood to an unhealthy degree, were admittedly low.Well, I sat in the theater for two hours...smiling and cheering. Well, internally. Is JURASSIC WORLD a ""good"" movie, per say? Nope. But then, neither was the first, really; fun, exciting, awesome--but it was never gonna win Best Picture. And neither will WORLD. But what it does is capture some of the excitement of the first--partly through a ton of throwbacks, mostly via its fun, thrilling, wryly humorous atmosphere. This is helped in large part by some incredible CGI, and Chris Pratt as the lead: a wisecracking, macho man with a vest and a rifle and a pack of raptors. Yeah, that's right: his own pack of raptors. And it actually makes sense, as much as anything in the JURASSIC universe makes sense.The plot is largely inconsequential: a ""fake"" (get it? as opposed to ""real""?) dinosaur gets loose, wrecking havoc on a theme park. Come on; you aren't watching this for the plot. You aren't watching this for Bryce Dallas Howard to run around the entire film in heels and somehow never trip. You aren't watching this for shallow character development and improbably action scenes. You're watching this for the thrills, the laughs, the feeling of being a ten year old chugging down Diet Coke and popcorn and grinning ear-to-ear. And JURASSIC WORLD delivers this in spades. It's got me excited for further installments, and considering I had low expectations to start with, that's pretty darn impressive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T8JWIVIMSHDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013P0X0WQ#wasThisHelpful","R3T8JWIVIMSHDP","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jay, a young Scotsman, travels across the west in search of his love Rose. Unbeknownst to him, Rose and her father have a bounty on their heads, and are pursued by a band bounty hunters, most especially Silas, who uses the boy to find the girl. Jay is about to learn that the west is truly wild, and that even love may not overcome all of its dangers.Written and directed by John Maclean, SLOW WEST comes off feeling like a slight film in many ways: the story is small, the themes small, the film itself short (less than 90 minutes), and the pace rather rapid. The focus is on characters who are never truly developed, despite rock-solid performances. Leads Jodi Smit-McPhee and Michael Fassbender are nearly flawless, and supporting roles (especially Ben Mendelsohn, Caren Pistorius, and Rory McCann) help add a certain poignancy that would otherwise be lacking.Still, there's a lot of positive here. It's well-directed; the script is strong if not ground-breaking. The film's target audience probably isn't western fans, or even people like myself who prefer ""anti-westerns"" (UNFORGIVEN, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, etc). It's more a tragic love story, and if you take it as such, it's worth a viewing. Maybe not everything it could've been, but SLOW WEST is still worthwhile, and if nothing else a promise of good things to come from writer/directer Maclean.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E43M2JBCJWDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XU8CMUK#wasThisHelpful","R1E43M2JBCJWDC","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally, I begin my movie reviews with a brief rehash of the plot, usually ending with some sort of melodramatic teaser designed to lure you in (if I like a film) or make you smirk (if I don't). However, for a film like AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, most of you know what you're getting into: your quirky band of heroes banding together to save the world. So going over the plot is largely pointless. Basically, Tony Stark gets a little egomaniacal, creates an A.I. using technology he doesn't understand, and now the Avengers have to assemble to stop nothing short than the total extinction of the human species.AGE OF ULTRON is the closest Marvel has come to making a ""dark"" comic book film (in the vein of the DC Batman films, for comparison). And the over-arching theme here is actually pretty dark: ultimate peace can only come with death. Yeah, deep. Obviously, Joss Whedon and company aren't going to beat you over the head with any of this; AGE OF ULTRON is, like the first film, laced with humor and wit. James Spader, as the titular villain, is nothing short of spectacular--he's menacing and terrifying, and yet utterly hilarious, coming off as something of a petulant teenager. There are also a few extra layers given to Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson's characters, which gives the actors a little more room to maneuver. And the addition of the not-mutants--thanks, copyright laws--is actually seamless. Aaron Taylor-Jonson and Elizabeth Olsen are solid; they join Spader and the returning cast, all of whom turn in reliably good performances. Kudos also to Andy Serkis in his cameo, which as I understand it is to be expanded later in the Marvel universe.This last statement leads me to what is probably this film's largest flaw: it's filler. Really, that's what it is. Yes, it has great performances, a solid script, and themes that truly make you think. (And, yes, James Spader. He needs to be relevant again. Seriously, of all the treats in this film, his performance is tops.) It's not a weak movie; this is as much a product of love from Whedon as the first film, and it's a thrill ride from start to finish. That said...yeah, it's filler. It's building towards storylines that are yet to come in the Marvel universe. There's a sense of ho-hum here that ultimately knocks the movie down a few pegs, considering the gravity of the themes that the are pursued. It's a good film; it's even worth repeated viewings. But is it everything it could've been? Unfortunately, no. But, hey: what's here is pretty darn good. Anything to keep the novelty of Robert Downey Jr. being an action hero going, right?","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ162UALTDNA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAJ8QXC#wasThisHelpful","RQ162UALTDNA0","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bonnie Jo Campbell's MOTHERS, TELL YOUR DAUGHTERS is a blunt, honest glimpse into the lives of ordinary, every day women. People like yourself. The collection has two great strengths: Campbell's honesty, and the quality of her prose. She isn't afraid to show the grit and warts that go with her characters.However, there is one major flaw with this collection: it gets repetitive very quickly. While her prose, as mentioned, is solid, she uses an awful lot of second person (you, your, etc.). Any college creative writing instructor will tell you to limit your use of the second person, and with good reason: it tends to stand out when it's used, therefore use sparingly. Campbell does not. Also, themes such as rape and cancer work their way into almost every story here. Again, not a bad thing, if you can take these stories one at a time. But they're collected together for a reason: to be read together. And as such, a little more variety is warranted.Ultimately, MOTHERS, TELL YOUR DAUGHTERS is a collection of very good stories, but is itself only a ho-hum collection. If you're willing to read one story every few days, then you should probably give it a shot; like I said, the writing is very good, and the characters are painfully realistic. But I prefer my short fiction collections to gel as a whole, and ultimately MOTHERS does not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O21I3ZLZN4YU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393248453#wasThisHelpful","R3O21I3ZLZN4YU","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eight miles below the surface may lie the secret to humanity's survival. A terrifying new disease is sweeping across the planet. People are slowly forgetting...first, little things. Then more important things. Finally, how to breathe, how to live. But down on the ocean floor, Clayton Nelson is working on a cure. He's the smartest man on Earth, for better or worse. If anyone can do it, it's him. Until things start happening. And communication lines are cut. Clayton's final transmission is a call for help to his brother Luke. But as Luke descends into the depths himself, he finds a world cut straight from his darkest nightmares, from snippets of horror from his troubled childhood. Waiting for him eight miles below the surface is nothing less than Hell itself.I picked up THE DEEP on a whim, thinking, ""Yeah, I haven't read a fun little horror novel in a while."" THE DEEP isn't fun. Not in the sense I was expecting. Nick Cutter (an alias of author Craig Davidson; hell, even the copyright is in his name) isn't in this for fun. THE DEEP is...think of the movie Event Horizon, with its pitch-perfect atmosphere of claustrophobic brutality (all other flaws aside). Now combine that with Michael Creighton's SPHERE, a little of Koontz's PHANTOMS, and a very bad acid trip. Yes, there's a problem in the sense that this novel draws so many references from other sources; but truly original work is hard to come by. What we should be excited about, however, is an original delivery.On this, THE DEEP excels. It starts slow, for a chapter or two...and then BAM!, you're on your own. The imagery is truly disturbing; I had to look away from the page at times. But the whole reason the imagery is so unsettling is because of the atmosphere Cutter has created. The two feed off each other; by the time we reach the novel's unforgiving end (after the first few pages, you'll know not to expect rainbows and butterflies), the reader is left somewhat hollowed out, racked by what they've read. This isn't a perfect horror novel; horror by definition isn't perfect. But it's one of the best horror novels I've read in a long, long time. It does exactly what it sets out to do: tip your reality upside down, chew you up and spit you out. It's one of the few horror novels I've read that is truly an all-around experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJBSAHXSORIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476717745#wasThisHelpful","RTJBSAHXSORIT","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1977: young punk Carey likes to hang out, drink cheep liquor, start fights, and try to get laid. His friends have pretty much the same attitude. Those that're still around, that is. Because some of them are missing. You see, there are these tar-men who dissolve you into goo, and these glowing balls of light that suck the very life out of you. Also a guy who looks exactly like Iggy Pop, except he's pretty much immortal and of an extremely homicidal bent.2013. Kaitlyn is a stuntwoman/waitress trying to eek out a living in Hollywood. Her friend Jackie drags her to an industry party one night, where Kaitlyn is forced into conversation with the star of 1990s sitcom. Yes, he's hot. But his eyes are rather lifeless...his mannerisms are forced...also there's this weird metallic thing he tries to shove down her throat. And he just won't leave her alone. And he has friends...THE UNNOTICEABLES is a gonad-punch of a novel, a two-minute rock jam of pounding drums and out-of-sync guitars. Robert Brockway has created a very interesting, unique little horror/sci-fi thriller with a punk edge and a healthy sense of dark humor. It has some flaws: his two (well, make that three, near the end) narrators sound a lot alike, and that ending rushes up on you, feels completely forced, and doesn't really resolve anything (not even on an emotional level; the story doesn't feel finished, plain and simple). Normally, that's enough for me to knock off at least one star. But the ride there...man, it's a rush. It's gory and funny and unsettling and all the good little things that make novels like this worthwhile. You haven't quite read anything like it, I'm willing to bet.

"The world of David Cronenberg is a dark and twisting place of shadows and other slithery things. He doesn't get light-hearted; his films may be laced with some incredibly dark humor--such as MAPS TO THE STARS--but they aren't comedies and they aren't going to make you smile. His films are always ABOUT something, but it's not something easily discernible. It's not necessarily something you will understand.Got that? Okay. Here's the problem with MAPS TO THE STARS: it's pretty accessible, for a Cronenberg film. And yet...it's still a Cronenberg film. It's not really a dissection of celebrity culture, inasmuch as it's a psycho-drama about family secrets and hereditary violence that just happens to play upon the charade of acting and the indulgence of celebrity. The plot essentially revolves around Agatha (an incredible Mia Wasikowska), a scarred young woman with a tenuous relationship with celebrity (she claims to have struck up a relationship with Carrie Fisher on Twitter). Naturally, very little is as it initially seems. Cue some truly disturbing imagery (disturbing, not graphic, though yes, it gets graphic eventually) that mixes dreams and reality, and a violent conclusion that doesn't tie too many threads together, but isn't supposed to, either.MAPS TO THE STARS isn't for everyone. It's for Cronenberg fans pretty much, except it's kind of Cronenberg-lite. Oh, there are some true gems here; Wasikowska is fantastic, Julianne Moore is superb, Evan Bird is pitch-perfect, and John Cusak finally gets to sink his teeth into a Cronenberg role (something I've been waiting on for a long time; Cusak is an underrated actor, thanks largely to the schlock he does to fund more independent work like this). The cinematography is on-point, and the dialogue and imagery, not to mention the sure-handed direction, is what you expect from a Cronenberg film. The themes are right up his alley and executed more-or-less effectively. But...but it just feels empty. Moments of near-greatness, surrounded by mediocrity, don't make a great film. Perhaps if this were a new filmmaker, I would be saying, ""This film has a ton of promise; I can't wait for great things in the future."" But this is David Cronenberg; by this point, we can expect greatness. Obviously, we aren't always going to get it; art doesn't work that way. And MAPS TO THE STARS has much to offer its viewers, if you can put up with feeling very uncomfortable (if you're a Cronenberg fan, you're used to this). But it isn't everything it could have been. It's a promising film from a director who, more times than not, exceeds that promise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RMHI2FEXP9EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5DYSHE#wasThisHelpful","R2RMHI2FEXP9EK","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The call it the Grizzly Maze: a swath of Alaskan forest that, supposedly, even grizzlies can get lost in. As boys, Beckett and Rowan's father refused to take hunters there, feeling it was sacred ground. Well, that hallowed territory has been invaded by human poachers. And one bear in particular is very, very, VERY pissed off. Trying to stop its rampage are a sheriff's deputy, his wayward brother, his wife, another deputy because the brother needs a love interest, and a poacher played by Billy Bob Thornton...because.As you may have guessed by the above paragraph, I'm kind of down on INTO THE GRIZZLY MAZE. I went into it with so-so hopes. Thomas Jane is a grossly underrated actor, and James Marsden has shown some promise; also, when given the right material, Billy Bob Thornton can really tear into a character. Put those three (plus Scott Glenn, for God's sake!) into a B-grade throwback to the nature-vs-man horror films of the seventies (specifically, ahem, GRIZZLY), and you've got a recipe for a fun, thrilling little movie. Well...promise is all you get. The acting is mostly solid (Glenn is utterly wasted; Piper Perabo is helped by the fact that her character is deaf, and therefore she doesn't have to speak), but the script is just God-awful. I mean so bad, Thornton's character blurts out ""this ain't your average bear"" in complete seriousness. Plus, you have the gratuitous gore shots that actually FEEL gratuitous. And the CGI, when it's used, is laughable. (Granted, small budget; but hey, if you can't afford good CGI, stick to practical effects.)Honestly, I'd recommend INTO THE GRIZZLY MAZE only if you have nothing else to watch. I was in the mood, with limited hopes, but even then, I felt disappointed. There's the heart of a decent film here--a horror feature centered around the brothers' troubled relationship--but it throws too much into the mix. If the movie had been a little longer, a little simpler, and written by someone else, it would come more highly recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RULIYQVM5SQDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9HSA42#wasThisHelpful","RULIYQVM5SQDO","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The notebooks were clearly written by either Ryo's mother or father. But who?

"A new Roger Alan Wade album is like a breath of fresh barroom air. With just his acoustic guitar and rich, workingman baritone, Wade writes and sings beautifully poetic country songs (interspersed with raunchy party numbers, though BAD NEWS KNOCKIN' fits entirely in the former category).""Warm Spanish Wine"" and ""The Ballad of Shine Marley"" may be two of the most beautiful numbers he's written, while ""Red Shoes Blues"" continues his knack for finding unexpected, yet strangely appropriate ways of comparing love to everyday life. ""I Lived the Life"" is the obligatory outlaw ballad--obligatory only in the sense that its inclusion is expected; the song itself is, again, oddly poetic. Wade may have made a name of himself by collaborating with cousin Johnny Knoxvile and his Jackass gang, yet those in the know are aware that he's one of the most sensitive songwriters out there. BAD NEWS KNOCKIN' isn't his best album; check out STONED TRAVELLER (I whip out ""Brainerd Road/Kingfisher Blues"" whenever I feel like showing my friends what true songcraft sounds like) for that distinction. Yet this may be his second best overall effort; and in the Roger Alan Wade catalogue, second-best is still better than practically anything you're likely to hear through the mainstream outlets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDBE2BQK09V6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q039XUE#wasThisHelpful","RDBE2BQK09V6","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A young woman is going to her parents' old cabin in the woods to take pictures, because her mother is too stingy to have a realtor do it. Of course, her boyfriend invites a bunch of people along, because young folks have to party and go wild all the time. And naturally they get there after a string of disappearances and strange occurrences, which has roused the suspicion of the local sheriff.

The acting is actually pretty good (Michael Ironside showing up and proving he's still the best, Gil Bellows doing a great job in a supporting role as the sheriff), but the direction and script are just...blah. I can't think of another way to describe it. There's a sense of humor about the film that's admirable (CABIN IN THE WOODS-lite, make that super lite), but ultimately it's a horror film without any depth and no real substance, despite an ending that makes you want to think otherwise (which you can see coming a mile away, without binoculars). The characters are interchangeable (not a fault of the actors, who do a good job with what they're given); the plot is hokey, and everything feels contrived. Special effects are okay when they're relevant, but this would've been a much better movie if the aliens had never actually appeared on-film.

Together, they endure a harsh winter and the unforgiving frontier in an effort to do the right thing for their own reasons.THE HOMESMAN is a beautiful and haunting film, based on the novel by Glendon Swarthout (I haven't read it yet but I aim to). The lead performances from Hillary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones are flawless, and a plethora of name actors show up and fill out their bit parts: Meryl Streep, James Spader, John Lithgow, Barry Corbin, Hailee Steinfeld, Jesse Plemmons, Tim Blake Nelson, and William Fichtner all have cameo roles that help round out the film. Jones's direction is solid; the film drags a little as it reaches the middle, but a dark change in direct breathes new life into the plot. The story is original, and the characters, if not entirely likable, are interesting and three-dimensional; also, Jones has cast himself somewhat against type (at first, at least; by the film's end he's the same curmudgeonly bad*** you'd expect), and it's nice to see him crack a smile on occasion. But truly, THE HOMESMAN is a solid western that takes the tropes you'd expect from the modern ""anti-western"" and pits them against an interesting and compelling storyline.

"Shirley Jackson is a grossly underrated writer. Casual readers know her for two works: her dreary post-apocalyptic short story ""The Lottery,"" read in pretty much every high school English program; and THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE, which set the standard for modern haunted house stories. It's easy to ignore her enormous body of work, short stories and novels that poke and prod and, yes, often times unsettle and play hell with the nerves.LET ME TELL YOU: NEW STORIES, ESSAYS, AND OTHER WRITINGS encompasses the traits that make Jackson such a pleasure to read. This is a collection of unpublished fiction, including very early fiction; essays that vary on topics (a raucous tribute to Dr. Seuss, an ode to her haunted house); humorous musings on domestic life; and a few brief pieces (mostly lectures) about writing. Throughout the nonfiction, readers will find a delightfully cynical sense of humor (remember: ""The Lottery"" is a very funny story in a very, very dark vein). The nonfiction is fun to read but not really worth the price of admission; you're coming here for the fiction, mostly, and though the stories are strong independently (except for the earliest pieces, which are here for curiosity's sake), taken together they're a bit repetitive, as the same themes get played with in back-to-back pieces.Now, that's not to undermine Jackson's body of work; she's one of the great 20th century American writers, known mostly for horror and ghost stories but truly just an all-around gifted writer. But LET ME TELL YOU is more for the die-hard fan, who can't wait to get their hands on anything Jackson has written. Which, let's face it, fits a lot of people. I'm giving this collection 3 stars because, as a whole, it's hit-and-miss; but when it hits, it hits with a sucker punch--sometimes unsettling, sometimes downright hilarious.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPPA727QW78OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997662#wasThisHelpful","RPPA727QW78OB","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FISHBOWL chronicles the events in the lives of a select few inhabitants of the Seville on Roxy, starting with Katie and Connor, a beautiful young woman in love and her boyfriend who's seeing someone on the side. The story is bookended, such as it were, by Connor's goldfish Ian, whose existential outlook on life (inherent in his nature, as a creature who views life as a series of momentary images) perfectly fits his latest plight: he he rapidly falling twenty-seven stories to the street below.Bradley Somer's FISHBOWL has a unique take on its theme, with the incorporation of Ian, which allows the author to vent his omniscient knowledge. The prose is solid, too, and there's a nice bitter sense of humor that underlines everything. That said, Ian's tale is easily the most interesting; the short chapters keep the reader going, but after a while it slowly dawns: these characters are basically boring. Other than the framing device, and Somer's admittedly sure-handed tone, there isn't really anything here you haven't seen before. There's no edge, just the glimmer of an edge.If FISHBOWL had embraced its uniqueness, then with Somer's solid writing, it would've been a four or five star review easily.But as it is, it's a series of short interlacing chapters about characters we don't really care about...and Ian, whose tale deserves an entire novel in and of itself.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KFYIYF96C23R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057809#wasThisHelpful","R2KFYIYF96C23R","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A woman discovers that her piano has become haunted by the very physical presence of Johann Sebastian Bach.MUSIC FOR WARTIME is a strongly cohesive, thematic collection.

"Picking up where the Black Crowes left off, Blackberry Smoke seamlessly blends Southern rock and country, creating songs that charge and chug, mostly polished but with enough of an edge to still grate against the grain. I'll admit that this is my first outing with the band; I caught ""Rock & Roll Again"" on Sirius (in my first week of having it!) and I was hooked. Most of the album follows a similar vein: propulsive Southern rock with country melodies, electric guitars sometimes segueing to drop-tuned acoustic riffs.The album is anchored by lead vocalist/guitarist Charlie Starr's lyrics: poetic but not too pretentious, bland and cliched only on occasion. To someone used to mainstream country or rock, this album will probably be like a straight-shot to the throat. But hopefully most of us know that genuinely good music exists out there. I'm rather ashamed I didn't know about Blackberry Smoke before now (hey, I'm an Illinois boy, cut me some slack), but HOLDING ALL THE ROSES has me hooked and jonesing for some more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPMIPZBKDFIF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PC2IO9A#wasThisHelpful","RPMIPZBKDFIF9","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nola Lantri is a slightly-introverted, sarcastic young woman with a mind-numbing job at the local courthouse. It suits her; the companionship of others sometimes makes her feel self-conscious about her own life. Which is made even more complicated by the fact that Nola is a tracist: she can sense the energy that leaves the body when a person dies. She can't tell you how or with what or why a person died, just where. It's a limited skillset, but for those who have the need--like Jack Dalton, Detective Division Commander of the Redford City Police Department--it's invaluable. Dalton has consulted Nola on a various cases, but none so high-profile as this: Culver Bryant, wealthy real estate developer, gone missing. He's left behind a frosty wife, a hyperactive girlfriend, a slick business partner, and a mysterious half-brother who has a few secrets he seems to be all-too-eager to share. One or all of these individuals is complicit in Culver's disappearance...and when mysterious packages start showing up on Nola' doorstep, she's about to find herself in well over her head, with dark discoveries just around the corner.Letitia L. Moffitt's TRACE is splendid mixture of crime, supernatural chills, romance, and mystery. But it's also a character study--a young woman struggling to find her identity and place in a society she doesn't feel a part of, dealing with a gift very few others have. The novel sets a quick pace, while simultaneously taking you deep into Nola's psyche; and yet, it doesn't reveal everything about its heroine, setting the reader up for future installments. TRACE makes for a nice, quick-paced summer read...but it's also much more than that: an insightful character study set against a romantic thriller background, with a supernatural edge that gives it an extra bite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V80BBTWF2VV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942737025#wasThisHelpful","R1V80BBTWF2VV7","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jeanette, Louisiana, has been hit hard by the BP oil spill. The shrimpers in town are all leaving elsewhere. One of those staying behind is  Gus Lindquist, a one-armed man hoping to discover lost pirate treasure. Unfortunately, he's searching on ground operated by the Toup Brothers, twin marijuana dealers with a reputation for being violent and unstable. Weaving in and out of this central struggle are quirky and powerful characters, none so impressive and beautifully drawn as the Louisiana swamp itself.Tom Cooper's THE MARAUDERS is a fun, sometimes funny book with great characters and stellar prose. The story itself isn't all that strong, and some of the characters actually have very little impact on the story itself. That said, these flaws are forgivable and even forgettable. The book moves along quickly and compellingly, towards a climax that comes out of nowhere (in a good way) and leaves you wanting more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RHG6Q6N7BIOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140561#wasThisHelpful","R1RHG6Q6N7BIOI","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amelia is a single mother coping with the loss of her husband, trying to figure out her son Samuel's fascination with a monster that lives in his room. Samuel is causing problems at school and in Amelia's admittedly small social life. But really, that's only the beginning. Because Amelia begins sensing that something is wrong as well. That sudden roach infestation. Creaks and groans in the house at night. Shadowy figures haunting her waking and sleeping moments. A reality that begins to spiral into madness, where Amelia isn't sure what is what...or who she is...but she only knows one thing: you can't let the Babadook in.I'd heard this movie got under your skin. And oh boy, does it. I talked a friend who said she'd watched it a few weeks ago and it still haunted her. I found myself shaking while watching it. This is a true blend of psychological and visceral horror. Oh, there's a little gore (not much), and some things that go bump in the night. But as with the best horror films, what truly terrifies in THE BABADOOK is what you don't exactly see, but what you know is going on. What you're terrified is going to happen next. It's a film that builds on itself, descending into a sort of madness that perhaps feels a little too close for comfort.You can thank the lead actors: Essie Davis and the terrific child actor Noah Wiseman. You can thank writer/director Jennifer Kent, who's crafted a magnificent little horror film. The ending plays a little weak, considering the strength of everything that builds up to it, but it's actually rather satisfying when you stop and think about it. And if not...well, THE BABADOOK is so good, and so unnerving, that a couple of minutes isn't going to ruin it for you. It's terrifying. It's hide your eyes behind your hands and peak around your fingers terrifying. I haven't been this scared and giddy in quite a while.

"Most people probably never stop and think about how pervasive illegal drugs have become in today's society. Probably not even if you're using them. And even people who acknowledge the fact that drugs are everywhere probably don't realize their brutal origins. We hear about the Mexican cartel violence almost daily, but it's hard to understand the severity--dare I say, the reality--of the situation unless you're directly affected by it.Hence why Roberto Saviano's ZERO ZERO ZERO is an important book. It is a detailed, unflinching account of the power of cocaine. From its humble--and disgusting--origins, to the violence it inflicts on the body and mind, to the horrific deeds people perpetrate to gain money from it. Saviano chronicles the rise and fall of various gangsters, most of whom you've probably never heard of, but who played an influential role in the chaos we see today. He also manages to sit down with lower level members, people who'll bare their souls due to arrogance, fear, or a fascinating combination of the two. This latter part is where the book really shines--when Saviano puts a face to the violence, lets inside the world as opposed to telling us about it. The only reason I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars is because the narrative parts become increasingly convoluted. Saviano's prose is poetic; in fact, the introductory segments to each section are absolutely--and terrifyingly--beautiful. But quality prose can't hide an inundation of facts. Yes, it's informative; but it's hard to retain. The overall effect can be one of confusion and disorientation; but then again, that may be what Saviano is going for.Overall, ZERO ZERO ZERO is an important, informative read. It has its flaws, and you may have to force yourself to trudge through some parts. It's also incredibly violent; the violence isn't necessarily rendered in detail, and there aren't any photos, but there's no shying away from the fact that this actually happened...and is happening now. ZERO ZERO ZERO isn't for the feint of heart; but then, as Saviano seems to be suggesting, if things get out of hand, the feint of heart won't have a place in this world any longer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1500AVOBCSO14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205507#wasThisHelpful","R1500AVOBCSO14","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a house not far from Jack's home. It's said ghosts gather there one night a year. Jack doesn't really believe, of course. But Jack is a curious boy, and there's no harm in breaking into the old building. In walking down the halls. In opening that door at the end, with the sliver of light coming out from beneath. Certainly no harm in joining the twelve individuals gathered around the table, each with a candle in front of them and a story to tell.If Dave Shelton's THIRTEEN CHAIRS has a major flaw, it's this: the central story is probably more interesting than the individual tales it weaves around. That said, those stories are chilling in a way that young adult fiction usually isn't. Shelton has a way with narration and language, crafting different voices for each of his stories. There's some gore and violence, though nothing too extreme; this is YA fiction after all. (I think I saw somewhere that this was written for children. I would say 10 and up, but then I was reading Stephen King by the fifth grade, so I'm not a good judge for that.) Mostly (as is, unfortunately, too-frequently pointed out), the true terrors come from what remains unsaid. Which is how good horror, for any audience, should be. THIRTEEN CHAIRS is an enjoyable, and enjoyably unsettling, collection of YA ghost stories by a talented author who knows how to talk to his audience, not talk down to them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LRDC3MC2A2UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545816653#wasThisHelpful","R3LRDC3MC2A2UD","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Photojournalist Naomi is in Paris, battling her self-conscious image of herself as unintelligent, while chronicling the cannibalistic murder of a French philosopher, whose husband/prime suspect has vanished. Naomi's boyfriend and fellow journalist Nathan--educated but jealous--finds himself studying a Canadian doctor whose claim to fame is an STD Nathan now suffers, but who has recently dipped into psychological studies involving his daughter.These two cases aren't as disparate as they may first appear, and before long we are plunged into a twisted world of sex and mutilation, philosophy and international politics, where nothing is as it seems.  Cronenberg's CONSUMED plays out much like his films--a violent, sexually charged descent into the world of technological and philosophical consumerism, laced with metaphors and irony and a dark sense of humor that threatens to turn vicious. Cronenberg's prose is surprisingly strong; good screenwriters don't always make good novelists, but he brings the same aesthetic here that he did to his earlier films, creating an engulfing world that slowly draws you in.Unfortunately, this is probably more eXistenZ than it is Videodrome: a watered-down version of what might have been. Of course, only Cronenberg's longtime fans may pick up on that; for newcomers, or those who haven't seen his earlier films, this will be a savage sucker punch to the gut (and groin). It builds pace slowly but steadily, and is prone to frequent waxing prosaic that borders on the tedious (though Cronenberg's attention to detail is admirable and frightening). This may not be the great horror/thriller some fans were wanting, but if you enjoy Cronenberg's films, you owe it to yourself to check this out. And if you're unfamiliar with his work...then brace yourself for a psychologically unsettling excursion into perversity that may be a little too close to comfort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LYO8RF0BVSYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416596135#wasThisHelpful","R1LYO8RF0BVSYA","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The stories in this collection illustrate a collection of flawed, sometimes morally ambiguous characters. A former police officer decides to help an abused woman get revenge. A young woman attends a chainsaw party on--and under--a frozen lake. Men on a mushroom hunting expedition encounter much more than they bargained for.

His characters are realistic; his plots are deceptively simple. While there are a couple of examples of the by-wrote ""literary"" pieces (you know the kind: they reek of MFA workshops and expensive cups of non-Starbucks coffee), mostly these stories manage to avoid pretension, which is a nice surprise in a literary collection; usually you have to mix with different genre tropes to get that.

But then he wakes up in the middle of the night and finds Bea naked in the woods. She begins acting strange in little ways that seem quirky at first, but begin to build up in a menacing fashion. And the neighboring couple is a bit odd. Perhaps dangerously so. And what's with the sores on Bea's legs, and the fact that Paul isn't entirely sure she's his wife anymore?HONEYMOON is better than it has any right to be. It starts off slow, innocently bland, and doesn't build quickly. It's something of a slow-burner, though by the final 15 minutes, things get reminiscent of David Cronenberg. It's a bit predictable, true, and stories like this inherently have weak endings (though this one is deliciously twisted just the same). But the acting from the two leads, Rose Leslie and Harry Treadway, is absolutely solid, and Leigh Janiak's direction is pretty much spotless. HONEYMOON has its flaws, but it's better than you're probably thinking it is.

"Chuck Palahniuk is one of those authors I keep returning to every chance I get, even though I've actually enjoyed only a small portion of his work. HAUNTED is a classic; FIGHT CLUB is good if only for the promise it showed (fulfilled in the far-better film version). BEAUTIFUL YOU wasn't too shabby.  And some of the stories in MAKE SOMETHING UP: STORIES YOU CAN'T UNREAD are truly enjoyable. Although, with Palahniuk, ""enjoyable"" isn't necessarily the most appropriate word.The problem is, many of these stories come off as unremarkable, almost as if they're here simply for the sake of inclusion.  And some of them, like a lot of Palahniuk's work, seem to go simply for the gross-out. Palahniuk is always at his best when he uses ""gross-out"" humor for a higher purpose. ""The Toad Prince,"" in this collection, is a prime example: a stomach-churning little ditty about body manipulation that is actually more than the sum of its parts. Elsewhere, Palahniuk goes for more emotional bent; ""Knock Knock"" is gut-wrenching for an entirely different reason. That's the thing about this collection that makes it most enjoyable: at times, Palahniuk shows a sense of heart and compassion that isn't as readily apparent in his novels.Ultimately, MAKE SOMETHING UP will be an enjoyable read for Palahniuk's legions of die-hard fans. Or those like me who simply keep reading him looking for...something. Love him or hate him, there's no denying that Palahniuk has one of the most unique literary voices on the scene today. This collection is hit and miss at best; but some of you won't care, and for others, it's simply worth the experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T2XV8JF0FWQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538057#wasThisHelpful","R1T2XV8JF0FWQN","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Wells is an American petty crook who's wound up in Egypt in the early 1950s, after a rather nasty stint in Mexico and some wild-catting in Texas. Coming to alone and robbed in a strange room, he eventually finds his way--as all American expats do--to a bar, where a British man offers him a drink and a job: meet a beautiful French woman for dinner. Turns out, she has another job. It involves a hunchback with a dark secret, a beautiful German lounge singer with a dark secret, a suave Egyptian businessman with a dark secret, and a corrupt Egyptian police officer with a dark secret. And that's not even counting the revolution that's slowly brewing in the streets.Gore Vidal's THIEVES RUN OUT is pretty much everything you'd want in an international pulp novel: blood, bullets, and beautiful dames. Yes, it hasn't necessarily aged well (a main character named Mohammed Ali; racial stereotypes that are cringe-worthy), but it's a product of its time. I always love when a more ""literary"" author decides to schlub it up with the rest of us; the results can be surprising. Is THIEVES RUN OUT a lost classic? No, not really.

But a revolution is brewing, led by the headstrong Curtis. Their goal: to make it to the front of the train. By any means necessary.SNOWPIERCER is flawed. Let's get that out of the way first: on hindsight, it doesn't really make much sense. The story is delightfully dark and twisted (it's not a feel-good movie), but doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. Not to mention various plot holes that dot the film like swiss cheese.There. We've got that out of the way. Now dig this: SNOWPIERCER is better than you're probably expecting. It is, and I don't say this lightly, one of the most beautifully directed and orchestrated films I've seen in a long time. Thanks to Joon-ho Bong, it's a Hollywood dystopian action film with heavy Asian sensibilities; at times, you'll forget you're watching a Chris Evans vehicle, and instead think you're watching art. Which, in many respects, it is. Oh yes, you have fine performances: Chris Evans, Khang-ho Song, Octavia Spencer, John Hurt, Vlad Ivanov, Alison Pill, and Jamie Bell stand out, while Tilda Swinton was downright incredible. (I've heard talk that she narrowly missed out on an Oscar nomination, and this doesn't surprise me in the slightest.) Oh, and a cameo near the end that I won't ruin. Always a welcomed face.But there's more than that. What the script lacks in coherence, it makes up for in audacity, brutality, and a strange sense of wonder. All carried out artfully, with beautiful cinematography and a fine eye for detail. SNOWPIERCER is, as much as anything, an experience. Maybe not a masterpiece, maybe not a classic, but a film that'll certainly be discussed in certain circles for a long time to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMZR5C4N64KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7D824O#wasThisHelpful","R3EMZR5C4N64KU","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Louis Bloom is a small time crook without much of a conscience, looking for a way to advance in life. It isn't about money; it's about status, stability, about being proud of your work. Purely on accident, he stumbles across a veteran crew of nightcrawlers--freelance paparazzi-like cameramen who film violent incidents and sell it to news channels. Louis's interest is piqued. He has a knack for getting ""the shot,"" and it isn't long before he's manipulating scenes to make it look better and more dramatic. Manipulation leads to planned execution. Which leads to the dark madness you'll find in the city at night.If NIGHTCRAWLER has a flaw, it's that it takes itself a tad too seriously. A sense of dread pervades the film; at times this is a good thing (it's incredibly creepy, almost--but not quite--a psychological horror film), but it makes things seem a little too ""important,"" almost didactic in spots. Especially with Rene Russo's character, a newswoman unafraid to sell her soul to get the best story (even if it isn't entirely true); the character is promising (and the performance is great), but at times she's almost a caricature.Still, NIGHTCRAWLER has a lot to offer. A lot. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a riveting performance; he's great at playing the creep, even when he's portraying a good guy (check out PRISONERS). Louis is definitely not a good guy. Unsuspecting audiences may find themselves in uncomfortable territory very fast; I'd place NIGHTCRAWLER in similar territory as HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, in that it's an exploration of the public's adulation of violent and incendiary news. It's solidly written and directed by Dan Gilroy; maybe a little indulgent in spots, and ultimately not as important as it perhaps wishes to be, but it's undeniably creepy and unforgiving.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B5JSDO8OIAPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3DMJZW#wasThisHelpful","R1B5JSDO8OIAPU","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Riggan (Michael Keaton) is a washed up former franchise actor who's desperate to be relevant again. He finds himself in an old theater, directing and starring in a needless adaptation of a Raymond Carver story, talking to his superhero alter ego and moving things with his mind. Thanks to a freak accident on-set, Riggan hires his friend and acclaimed method actor Mike (Edward Norton) to star opposite him, simultaneously finding that their personalities do not clash very well. It doesn't help that Mike has a thing for Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone), who's struggling with demons of her own.If the characters above sound familiar to you, that's because they should be: BIRDMAN; OR, THE UNEXPECTED VIRTUE OF IGNORANCE is a deliciously tongue-maybe-in-cheek character study of its actors, set against the background of humanity's quest to be relevant in today's social media-driven society. The film's message is stripped from the headlines, but only occasionally feels preachy; this is thanks in large part to the outstanding central performances. Keaton is nuanced and subtle, yet over-the-top when the situation calls for it. Norton chews his way through every scene; it's one of his best performances to date. Emma Stone got lost in the Oscar shuffle, but this is also one of her better performances; the same can be said of costars Zach Galifianakis and Naomi Watts, both of whom are exceptional.And yet, what makes this film Best Picture-worthy is the fact that all of the components come together. The cinematography and music are perfectly pitched and astounding; if you've seen some avant garde films before, you've probably seen something like this...and yet, it still feels like you haven't. The script, too, is almost flawless; writer/director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu has crafted a truly amazing film. Yes, the ending is a bit hackneyed, and I saw it coming from the first time I watched the trailer; but this film is truly more about the journey there. It's funny and emotional.  You'll have trouble taking your eyes off the screen. BIRDMAN holds your attention, but it also lingers with you afterwards. One of the best films I've seen in a while, definitely one of the best newer films. For once, the Academy got something right, but that shouldn't determine whether you see the movie or not. Just watch it.

"I bought this album off the strength of ""All About That Bass"" (one of the best arranged pop songs I've heard in a long time) and ""Lips Are Movin',"" a delightfully clever little ditty.  Most of the album follows suit: modern pop & hip/hop mixed with 60s doo-wop, some light (very light) rap, and a little reggae.  Sort of a bubblegum Amy Winehouse, if you will, with far stronger vocals.That's actually the two strengths of this album: the melodies (utterly infectious) and Trainor's vocals.  She's a powerhouse singer who's keeping it restrained, going more for nuance.  It works, and thank God, because most of her lyrics are rather trite.  Face it: do we really need more ""you go, girl, be who you want"" songs?  Well, okay, we probably do.  And Trainor does it with the best of them; she's got a sense of humor about it, and absolutely no shame.The latter is where the album actually falters.  Girl power is one thing; self-image is one thing.  But singing about how you're beautiful the way you are, and then being proud strutting the walk of shame?  Sort of a mixed signal.  Don't get me wrong: I'm no prude.  But Trainer seems to bounce back and forth; the album would be more solid if she stuck with one and ran with it.  And ditched ""Bang Them Sticks,"" which is just atrocious.  And let's not forget: this is an album that OPENS with an interlude, closes with a song called ""Credit"" (the Deluxe version at least), and is entitled TITLE, which is arguably not as bad as calling your record UNTITLED, but it's close.  (Seriously, kids, look it up.  Stuff's been done to death.)  I've also got a thing about songs that reference texting (yeah, I do it, but it's so unpoetic), and anytime a tune uses the word ""boobies.""  As a rhyme, no less.I almost wish I'd gotten the regular version; a little goes a long way.  That said, TITLE (groan) is a very solid, very delightful album.  I listened to it after a stressful day, and I can barely remember what was so worrisome.  It's full of catchy hooks and infectious melodies, performed by a very good vocalist.  Bubblegum pop it may be at heart, and a morally ambiguous heart at that, but it'll still put a smile on your face and a tap in your toes.  If you want music  with some depth, you know where to go (I hope).  If you want music that's fun, this is where you should be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ABORUKOTXZCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIK4C5C#wasThisHelpful","R3ABORUKOTXZCP","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gillian Flynn's novel GONE GIRL was a brilliant character study of a mirage in a downward spiral: two people who never truly knew each other, and discover the depths to which each is willing to go.  Told in dueling first-person accounts, the novel played Nick and Amy off each other; by the halfway point, you didn't know what was what, who to trust, or if anyone at all could be trusted.David Fincher's adaptation, not surprisingly, isn't quite as deep.  It relies more on the nuanced performances of its stars (especially Ben Affleck; if you've read the book, then you know he's nailed the part perfectly), and the hook: a beautiful young woman goes missing.  Her husband declares his innocence, but he seems to be hiding something. That's it: a very simple premise that grows from there, as we learn more about this ""perfect"" couple.The acting is top-notch, though Affleck is the only one who truly gets a chance to shine.  (Rosamund Pike, for her part, does very well once things get going, but her character has been reduced.)  Gillian Flynn adapted her own novel; her fingerprints are all over this, and the movie remains extremely faithful.  Once again, David Fincher delivers another solid directorial performance.  Personally, I enjoy his movies, though I've rarely bought into the hype; SE7VEN and FIGHT CLUB (a film, by the way, that was actually better than its source novel) are the only two of his films that have blown me away.  Yet there's no denying he knows how to tell the story he wants to.  GONE GIRL will get overhyped; it'll also be hated for its unconventionality. Yet it is definitely worth watching.  But you should definitely read the book; actually, you should read SHARP OBJECTS first, Flynn's best novel.  And perhaps indulge in a few more ""indie"" thrillers to get a sense of what GONE GIRL (the movie) is trying to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FGC8BRIMUEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5996EQ#wasThisHelpful","R30FGC8BRIMUEF","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Of note: he found himself stranded at sea, all alone, except for his walrus friend, Mr. Tusk.  In fact, he's never really gotten over his experiences with Mr. Tusk.  Which is very unfortunate for Wallace...Kevin Smith's TUSK is kind of like a mainstream answer to THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE, except with more of the irreverent humor you'd expect from a Kevin Smith film.  Smith initially gave horror a go with RED STATE, to mixed results; the film alienated much of its audience (as this will, in many ways) to be truly successful.  And yet, there was something there.  And there's something here, too.  The imagery is disturbing, to say the least; the emotions are genuine and, at times, ravaging.  And the performances are exactly what they need to be.  Justin Ling, as Wallace, is schmarmy and instantly dislikable, everything you'd expect from a guy who travels hundreds of miles to make fun of a kid who cut off his own leg.  And Michael Parks, as Howe, is at his campiest best.  It's a riveting performance; you can't take your eyes off him, as he hams it up notch after glorious notch.The supporting cast (namely Haley Joel Osment, Genesis Rodriguez, and a disguised/uncredited superstar I shan't name, as it was a surprise to me) are also game.  The script is solid; the jokes are funny.  But really, this is a horror film, and as such it's mostly a success.  You can tell that Smith is still feeling his way through the genre; but he has a better grasp on things this time.  TUSK is meant to be gory, campy, funny, and disturbing; it hits all of the right notes.  It's not for everyone, not by a long shot.  It's not even for a lot of horror fans.  But if you want something strange, something you haven't quite seen before, TUSK is definitely worth a viewing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26V4XXMMBNA53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NX8RUZE#wasThisHelpful","R26V4XXMMBNA53","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In contemporary India, three lives intersect: a young poacher, who blames himself for his cousin's death; an American film student, documenting the fight against poaching, who begins a disastrous tryst with her subject; and the Gravedigger, a rogue elephant known for killing humans and then covering their bodies.  Three stories spiraling toward a violent and inevitable conclusion, set against one of the darker aspects of human nature: the bloody hunt for riches.Tania James's THE TUSK THAT DID THE DAMAGE is a unique novel, in that it manages to use three points of view without ever stumbling over itself.  (Fear not: the Gravedigger's portions are in third-person, not first, something I dreaded when I first read the description.)  James has created three very interesting main characters, surrounded them with a well-rounded supporting cast, and let them loose in a harsh reality that often gets overlooked.  Underneath it all, there is a hint of preaching; it's never at the forefront, and kudos for that, but it's still there.  Also, eventually the plot slows, even as we approach the climax.  That said, THE TUSK THAT DID THE DAMAGE is a highly interesting read; you can peruse it and start to ponder the evils of ivory poaching, or you can look at it as a solid character study that happens to have a moral or two thrown in.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187LJN0Z592XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354126#wasThisHelpful","R187LJN0Z592XN","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Raf is a young London man suffering from a rare sleep disorder.  He basically operates on a 25-hour schedule, so he's always just one tic of the clock out of sync with the rest of the world.  That's bad for keeping jobs and relationships, but it's great if all you want to do is take drugs and rave.However, one night Raf notices a stunning young woman at a rave.  And suddenly, he's thrown into a twisting maze of international intrigue and matters of the heart, as he finds himself (not entirely willingly) unraveling a shroud of mystery involving a greedy mining company, kidnapped Burmese immigrants, and the woman who may be his one true love.  Oh, yeah, and oddly intelligent foxes that seem to act an awful lot like people.Ned Beauman's GLOW is a vaguely beatnik, vaguely Philip K. Dickian ride through drugs and corporate politics.  At times, Beauman's being too witty for his own good, rattling off scientific facts in a way that's supposed to support Raf's quirks, but really feels like filler.  Hence the lack of a couple stars.  Plus, the book just sort of...ends.  At times, I felt like putting it down and walking away for good; I have no qualms about it, trust me I have stacks of books waiting to be read.  And yet, I stuck with it, because there's something here that's infectious, a certain vibe I didn't think I could get elsewhere.  Is GLOW great?  No, not really.  Is it enjoyable?  Yes, absolutely.  It's also strangely unique; I'm sure you'll have many novels to compare it to (Dick immediately comes to mind for me), yet nothing quite seems to stick.  I'm not sure if I'd give this another read; but I'm also sure there are people out there who'll devour it and come back for seconds.  It's worth a try, at any rate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFL3N03KLO08H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352603#wasThisHelpful","RFL3N03KLO08H","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a director, Joe Carnahan is a bit infuriating.  He's given us SMOKIN' ACES, which is pure unadulterated fun; THE GREY, which is one of the best existential action films I've ever seen; and THE A-TEAM, which is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (I'd say I'd want my money back for seeing it, but someone else paid, so I'd just prefer the time.)  STRETCH leans more towards SMOKIN' ACES, with a bit of...well, everything else thrown in.  It starts off incredibly cheesy and slow; but get past the first ten minutes, when the film's vibe truly settles in, and it's a rocket from there until the finish line.The story revolves around a limo driver (Patrick Wilson), who's adopted the codename ""Stretch"" formerly used by his suicidal predecessor.  In an effort to sabotage a competing limo firm, Stretch sneaks in and snatches Karos (Chris Pine), an eccentric businessman who may be running from something.  Chaos ensues, and through the course of the night, Stretch will learn--and earn--his place on the pecking order.The acting here is exactly what it needs to be: over-the-top and anarchic.  Pine (in a rather extended cameo role) and Wilson excel; so do James Badge Dale, Ed Helms as the ghostly former Stretch (""What's the plan, Stretch? Successfully outrunning black men on flat surfaces?""), and a slough of cameos (Ray Liotta and The Hoff highlight the list).  The writing is surprisingly solid; I mean, there's no gold here, but the jokes are great, the action is steady, and the ending actually leaves you feeling satisfied (if not surprised).  Carnahan's direction is solid; he never lets things get out of hand, though his juggling does become precarious.  Ultimately, though, STRETCH is a delightfully dark action/comedy, like a typical action movie laced with LSD.  Guy Ritchie by way of Stanley Kubrick, if you can dig it.  Hopefully you can.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NE8WT593UG5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG3YQXU#wasThisHelpful","R1NE8WT593UG5T","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wes Carver grew up to be like his old man, just like all the boys did in Black River: a corrections officer at the local penitentiary.  But one day several years ago, a riot broke out, and Carver was taken hostage for 39 hours.  He emerged scarred and mutilated, physically and psychically.  Years later, he's come back to Black River to bury his wife's ashes and attend to unfinished business: try to mend the relationship with his stepson, whom he last saw on the other end of a gun; and try to stop the parole of the man who forever ruined his life.S. M. Hulse's BLACK RIVER isn't exactly anything new; if this were a movie, it'd probably be a yawn-fest.  What sets the book apart is Hulse's prose: haunting and sparse, beautifully understated.  It gets away from her at times--like she's trying for Cormac McCarthy and failing--but mostly, she succeeds.  And her characters are interesting: Wes and his stepson are intricately drawn, and reading about them becomes addictive after a while.  Hulse doesn't back away from the inherent violence in the book, but she doesn't play it up.  Instead, she simply does what her characters do: she deals with it.  This is a finely written contemporary western, one of the better ones out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z6972GI3HD6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544309871#wasThisHelpful","R2Z6972GI3HD6F","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You are Ajay Gale.  Returning to the nation of Kyrat to spread your mother's ashes, you immediately encounter the new warlord: Pagan Min, waging a war against the ""terrorists"" who want to bring him to justice for his crimes against humanity.  Pagan is ruthless, he is sarcastic, and he has a history with your mother...not to mention your father, whom he may have had killed.  You get caught up with the Golden Path, in an effort to figure out your past and perhaps bring down Pagan Min once and for all.I bought FAR CRY 3 on a whim, and immediately became hooked.  A FPS sandbox game that let me hunt dangerous animals and kill baddies with an assortment of weapons?  Sign me up!  FARY CRY 4 is that...and more.  Because admittedly, with FAR CRY 3, the story was weak; here, the story is actually pretty interesting.  Also, the details: I've found myself driving around the countryside just listening to the DJ.  His rant about twerking is priceless.  And let's not forget the wildlife: bears, tigers, demon fish, honey badgers, eagles that swoop out of nowhere...and trust me, you haven't lived until you've crashed through an enemy encampment riding an elephant, brandishing a machine gun.I've been playing this game since the day it came out, and I've only progressed a little ways in the main story, because I've been caught up in all the side features.  Various quests (hunting, rescue, exploring, etc.) help you flesh out your understanding of the mysterious nation and people of Kyrat. (Also, for some reason, I spent a long time hunting bears for upgrades.)  This game is all about fun and versatility.  While there are a few glitches (for the life of me, I cannot drive; and somehow, my head manages to wind up turned 90 degrees anytime I hit a tree), the fun outweighs everything else.  You've got a vast array of weapons, and a nice supply of enemies and wildlife to shoot them at.  (Kudos to the bow upgrade; you only get four weapon slots, and one of mine is reserved for that bow.)  The graphics are great, and the whole thing screams ""replay value."" I'm a baseball fanatic, and was looking for something to keep me going through the offseason; FAR CRY 4 is it. Hell, I'll still be playing come Spring Training.  I may even miss a couple of regular season games.  And I don't do that for just any video game.UPDATE: I've finished the main story arc.  The ending to the version I chose was just classic; what a great final line.  And if you let him, Pagan Min becomes a very well-drawn character (yes; you have some say in this).  He's in the background for most of the game, but he becomes more prominent near the finale, and you truly see the development.  If I could trust Hollywood, I'd love to see a film adaptation of this game.  The story is very rich and worth your time.  I'm not sure I'll spend as much sandbox play in this as I did in Far Cry 3, because the novelty has someone worn off, but I still have a couple of outposts to concur, as well as a palace, and one last item to craft.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HL3OQRND74MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAED6SY#wasThisHelpful","R3HL3OQRND74MW","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They're a band of misfits: a Terran mercenary; the emissary of a vicious warlord; a brutal prisoner bent on vengeance; and a conniving raccoon and his partner who's...mostly a tree.  Thrown together in the hunt for a mysterious orb, they are forced to band together to stop a rogue madman bent on destroying worlds.  In the process, they'll come to know each other, find what's really worth fighting for, and listen to some rockin' tunes.Remember THE AVENGERS?  How Joss Whedon weaved together a world that was both fun and serious, with humor and heart and something truly at stake?  GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is all of that, minus the real danger.  Oh, it starts out with you at the edge of your seats; but by the halfway point, when things start to take their ultimate shape, you understand that this isn't THAT kind of movie.  Which, you know what, is okay.  Sometimes, it's good to just have some fun.  You've got a wisecracking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper; what more could you want from life?The cast is strong.  Chris Pratt solidifies his star power as the leader of our misfits, with Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Cooper and Vin Diesel (in voice roles, although Diesel is almost a non-presence) holding their own as his counterparts.  Lee Pace makes a menacing villain, until he has nothing left to do but grunt and make menacing gestures.  Michael Rooker was a welcome surprise (as he usually is), and Glen Close, John C. Reilly, and Djimon Hounsou do great in their small roles.  (Also: look for Josh Brolin.  That's all I'm gonna say.)  The real scene-stealer is Benicio del Toro, who only has one scene (minus the post credits scene, which is just dandy) but pretty much steals the whole movie with his performance.  Which is basically par for the course.James Gunn has proven before that he's a director to watch; SLITHER remains a personal favorite of mine.  He knows how to make movies fun.  There's not much truly at stake in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, which is a bit of a downfall (hence the half-star); however, this movie is fun, fun, fun.  You know how it'll end up, but at least you've got a ragtag bunch of antiheroes to root for.  Also, the soundtrack, which actually plays a significant role in the film.  Put in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, sit back, have some popcorn, maybe a beer if you're of age and mind, and just enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC864OI0DQN3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1JQ2UO#wasThisHelpful","RC864OI0DQN3M","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A shadow falls across a young boy playing in the dirt.  The boy is Jamie Morton, an ordinary young boy growing up in small-town Maine.  The shadow belongs to Reverend Charles Jacobs, new to the town and hoping to fit in with his wife and young son.  What Jamie does not know is that his destiny is entwined with that of Jacobs, and the two will bounce each other throughout the rest of their lives, as Jacobs looks to turn a personal tragedy into a triumph of science...and the consequences be damned.Stephen King's REVIVAL is, hands down, the best work he's given us in a long time.  It's even better than the stellar MR. MERCEDES, or the killer first hundred pages of DOCTOR SLEEP.  You don't fully appreciate how utterly relentless the story is until the last 30-40 pages, when King pulls out the ace he's been hiding and throws it in your face, then smirks as you shudder in fear.  I've been a fan of King's for years now; some of his novels have unsettled me, though honestly I tend to read him more for his craft and character development.  REVIVAL unnerved me; dare I say, it actually scared me?  I fully expect to have nightmares in the coming days.  (Fun fact: the only other King books to actually give me nightmares were PET 'SEMETARY and, for some reason, BAG OF BONES.)  It's something of a slow-burner, with a sense of dread underneath every word.  It's Stephen King paying homage to Lovecraft and so many others, authors whose work still resonates today.  The title is fitting: a fantastic, terrifying return to he gut-wrenching horror that made King popular in the first place.  Be forewarned: REVIVAL offers you truth...but no mercy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKE8WKEC67LNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476770387#wasThisHelpful","RKE8WKEC67LNK","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They're back.  They're older and tougher and crazier than ever, and they're still led by the incomparable Barney Ross.  But on their latest gig, Ross discovers that the target is an old friend of his: Conrad Stonebanks (this, from the writer who once played the Italian Stallion), who helped form the Expendables but then went rogue.  Well, the mission goes disastrously wrong, and Ross is forced to hire a new crew.  Because when Harrison Ford tells you you're too old, you're too damn old.But when the new crew attempts to capture Conrad Stonebanks (gotta say the whole name), things go wrong yet again, and the old guys must show the kids a few new tricks.  Like you've known all along would happen.  There's nothing new in THE EXPENDABLES 3.  Oh, a couple new faces: some younger ones, plus Ford, Kelsey Grammar, and Wesley Snipes (who's still got it, by the way).  And the returning crew: Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Couture, Statham, Crewes, Lundgren, Lee.  They're all here for your entertainment: your unadulterated, purely for the love of it entertainment.You'll notice I left a couple key names out of the above cast.  Antonio Banderas is just...he's just awesome.  He spouts line after line with a grin on his face, then lapses into a serious moment, then kills a room full of baddies and quips another line.  Pure B-grade gold.  And Mel Gibson...his resurgence as a schlock villain is brilliant.  He knows we hate him, and he's a good enough actor to parlay that into cartoonish overacting that never once misses the mark. He's the perfect guy to play a man named Conrad Stonebanks in a film that isn't X-rated, and he relishes every moment he gets.  Plus, he and Stallone have great chemistry; you actually believe there's a past between the two, and that they'd do anything to kill the other.Overall, if you haven't seen an EXPENDABLES movie before, don't start here.  Start with 2, because that's the best.  Chuck Norris quipping Chuck Norris jokes.  Can't beat it.  (Although props to Schwarzenegger screaming, ""Let's get to the choppa!"")  And 3 drags in spots, until the story really gets going; then it just doesn't stop.  It's good B-grade entertainment; also, hopefully the last in the series, because anything else wouldn't be pushing the envelope, it'd be breaking it.

"Sin City: where you find what you want, and learn you don't want it at all. Like a reckless gambler who decides to take on the villainous Senator who runs the entire town.  Or the P.I., whose ex-lover slips back into his life...with a price.  Or the rough-and-tumble Marv, who never wants anything more than to take on someone as strong as himself. Or the stripper, who sought revenge until she found the bottom of the bottle.Brought to you in the same glaring black and white, the same brilliant splashes of red, SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR is more of the same.  Which is both a strength and a weakness.  First, the bad: the film feels inferior, because it isn't as fresh.  And the ending is surprisingly weak.  Also, the time line can be a little confusing, especially because Dwight's plastic surgery doesn't come off as believable (Clive Owen apparently couldn't reprise his role, or wouldn't for a key scene).  Hint: most of the film takes place prior to the last one.  Fans of the graphic novels might have a better time following the story.  I'll get around to reading them some day, I promise; I have a really long to-read list.Now, the good: it's fun.  It's awesome.  It's all the bada**ery you'd expect from a Robert Rodriguez/Frank Miller collaboration.  And the cast is just terrific.  Returning from the original, we have: Mickey Rourke, Powers Boothe (with much more to do, and he does it so exquisitely well), Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis (limited, but welcome), and probably some others; it's a huge cast.  The newcomers shine: Josh Brolin holds down a solid portion of the film as the before-Dwight; Eva Green (perhaps the definitive example of a classic actress unafraid to do B-grade entertainment for the fun of it) tantalizes and seduces as the titular dame.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeremy Piven, Christopher Lloyd, Ray Liotta, Lady Gaga, and Christopher Meloni all help round things out with parts big and small.  And Dennis Haysbert does a very good (and intimidating) job of filling in for the late Michael Clarke Duncan.This isn't a film for movie snobs.  It's a film for people who love to have fun...and live dangerously.  Robert Rodriguez, apart from his side career as a family film auteur (and frankly I can't stomach them), has made a career out of turning schlock into art.  Anyone who hasn't seen DESPERADO should do so pronto and just marvel.  SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR isn't on that same level.  It isn't even on par with the first SIN CITY film.  But DAME is this: bloody, artsy good fun, with a healthy sense of humor and absolutely no mercy.  In Sin City, turn down any dark alley and you may find what you want.  If you're unlucky enough, you may also find what you need.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VQW9EGJ5QC0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N201WPM#wasThisHelpful","R1VQW9EGJ5QC0Z","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this mesmerizing, funny, and sometimes terrifying collection, a teenage girl secretly grieving her father's disappearance encounters an old man with a rather strange affliction.  A young man working in a run-down Vietnamese hotel strikes up a relationship with an American tourist, and the demonic presence who's taken residence in one of the rooms.  Three old friends reenact a secret from the war that has come back to haunt one of them.  A girl is shipped off to Vietnam to lose weight on her grandmother's cooking, but finds a mysterious sweets vendor harboring a terrible secret.Violet Kupermsith's THE FRANGIPANI HOTEL is a stellar, first-rate collection of stories that dip in and out of reality.  Purportedly based on legends from Vietnamese folklore (updated for modern times), the stories are poignantly written, blending across genre borderlines into a surrealistic haze that permeates even the more grounded, relationship-driven pieces.  Some, such as the stellar ""Reception,"" feel almost like horror tales, while the opener, ""Boat Story,"" is a straight-up fable.  ""One-Finger"" even recalls some of Edgar Allan Poe's atmosphere.Throughout it all, Kupersmith's writing remains spot-on. She's got wit and charm, and a sympathy for her characters and their (and her) ancestry.  There's a lot that can be learned from THE FRANGIPANI HOTEL, but the best thing is, the collection never comes off as didactic. You can read more into these stories if you want (and you should), but you can also take them as spectacular pieces of short fiction.

These are men and women maybe you've met, maybe you haven't, but you've certainly heard about them, and there's something about their stories that you can relate to.

Taylor does this occasionally (especially when he starts mixing in Jewish culture, about halfway through the collection), but overall these stories are a solid read.

"Since 2003's TROUBLE NO MORE, Mellencamp has reinvented himself as a veritable folk singer, writing and performing songs of troubled everymen that occasionally philosophize about the state of the nation and/or society.  He has a tendency to stretch beyond his reach, but when he plays it close to the chest, he's been hitting solid music gold.PLAIN SPOKEN is the strongest of these ""new"" Mellencamp albums.  It starts off a somewhat mediocre note (""Sometimes there's God/And sometimes there's not,"" he croons on the second track, and while it seems poetic at first, after a while you're just like, ""Well, yeah"").  However, he kicks it into overdrive with ""The Isolation of Mister,"" and album highlights ""The Company of Cowards"" and ""The Brass Ring"" (the latter may be one of his best tunes yet).  ""Freedom of Speech"" is a bit obvious and light-hearted, given its company, but otherwise the remaining songs are all strong, culminating with the album's only electrically charged track ""Lawless Times,"" another ""well obviously"" song that at least has a sense of humor regarding itself.There are times I long for the Mellencamp of old.  But, I suppose, we can always put SCARECROW and AMERICAN FOOL on repeat.  PLAIN SPOKEN shows that Mellencamp is still going strong; and now, it's obvious he's making music that's important to him.  Whether it's as important to the rest of us as he thinks remains to be seen.

Steve Rodgers (Chris Evans) moonlights as Captain America, except it's really who he is all the time: a popular figure head, bouncing back and forth at the orders of his immediate commander Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), and S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford).  But when he finds himself on a questionable mission, immediately followed by an attack on a key S.H.I.E.L.D. figure, Rodgers must face the ultimate question: has he actually been used as a weapon against freedom?THE WINTER SOLDIER is a far superior film to its predecessor, which was glamorous and entertaining, but ultimately rather shallow.  SOLDIER has some bite; there are genuine repercussions here that will affect Marvel films to come.  There's also quite a bit of violence: the slick, stylized action sequences meant to dazzle (and they do), but also a few quick scenes that are actually rather disturbing.  There's a moral ambiguity that pervades the film, as the good guys and the bad guys seem to change from scene to scene.  It's not truly groundbreaking (come on: at the end of the day, the Cap will come through for us), but it's got some grit that many superhero films seem to lack.What truly helps elevate this film is the cast: Evans is charismatic, sort of a humble Robert Downey Jr.  He and Scarlett Johansson have great chemistry; it's also nice to see Johansson being more than just eye candy, which she was when Black Widow made her debut in IRON MAN 2.  Jackson does his thing (it seems to get better with each Marvel film, as he has more to do), and Redford injects a nice bit of humor into his role, especially near the end.  Anthonie Mackie is a welcome side-kick, and Sebastian Stan's stunt double is a great, nearly-unstoppable force as the titular villain.  Packed in are a couple of recurring roles that I won't spoil, plus a post-credits scene that would be absolutely perfect if not for certain copyright issues.The gist: THE WINTER SOLDIER is a CAPTAIN AMERICA film for the real world.  He's not just Uncle Sam's bosom buddy; he's a regular Joe forced to realize that his government may not have his best interests at heart.  That said, the good guys ultimately win, which is what we want in a Marvel film: enough bite to put us on edge, but an ending that is at least happy enough to make us think that tomorrow might be better.  But then again, that post credits scene...maybe not so happy after all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SIYTO4SUGV0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090SI3EI#wasThisHelpful","R2SIYTO4SUGV0Q","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the not-so distant future, war has broken out.  Mutants have been hunted to the verge of extinction, along with their human sympathizers.  Leading the slaughter: the heinous Sentinels, automated warriors that are nearly indestructible and utterly relentless.  In a last ditch effort to save their species, a group of mutant holdouts--led by Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen)--band together to send Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) consciousness back into his 1970s body.  His time-trippy task: to unite past Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) in an effort to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from starting the entire destructive war in motion.Well, things get a bit messed up, as they are wont to do, and that's where X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST hits its true stride.  It's an X-MEN film that genuinely makes you think things aren't entirely safe.  Largely this is due to the performances, especially Fassbender's, who takes his performance up a step from the last film (and that's saying something).  Also, of course, Jackman, the improbable superhero.  The rest of the cast is filled out by familiar faces playing the parts we love them in.  And also Peter Dinklage, because GAME OF THRONES is awesome.  The plot is a bit complex; and like most time-travel scenarios, it's so full of holes, you just have to shut your mind off to them.  (I will say this: FUTURE PAST handles the time-travel conundrums much better than many other films.)Personally, this is the X-MEN film I've been waiting for, as I actually felt FIRST CLASS didn't live up to all of its promise (though I enjoyed it immensely, except for Kevin Bacon's hairpiece).  By going back to the original film's director (Bryan Singer), the franchise has actually breathed some fresh life and exuberance into these characters.  It's nice to see the gang all back together (especially some sweet cameos), but it's even better knowing that the future (hehe) is in good hands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M2G4LM4JQEOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7IPGS6#wasThisHelpful","R2M2G4LM4JQEOB","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Three men find themselves stranded in a life raft in the middle of a lake, with the rift between them growing.  A woman must deal with a mysterious man who keeps trying to steal her children.Diane Cook's MAN V. NATURE is a masterful collection of stories that often take on the air of fables.  An undercurrent of the fantastic runs through most of these tales, though this is by no means a genre collection.  It is, instead, a very solid collection of fiction that tackles the human nature by removing itself a step or two from reality, without ever quite bridging the gap to surreal or science fiction. (Many of these stories reminded me of Margaret Atwood, if that helps.)  This is definitely a collection you'll be thinking about once you put it down, and entire collections like that are hard to come by.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5JG20NIGG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062333100#wasThisHelpful","R2Y5JG20NIGG7","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this funny, unsettling collection of short fiction, Thomas Pierce merges heart with a sense of unease, painting realistically flawed characters in sometimes unrealistic situations (that come off feeling very real).  A woman has an intense marriage--entirely in her head, which prompts her boyfriend to track down anyone who may have spawned the fantasy relationship.  A man struggles with the knowledge that his brother's body has become a new Typhoid Mary.  A woman must care for her son's cloned baby mammoth.HALL OF SMALL MAMMALS isn't a perfect collection; the titular is perhaps the weakest of the lot, a story similar to many we've seen before (despite the fact that the narrator comes off as very interesting).  But by and large, this is a very engaging collection that plays with emotions and expectations, merging quasi-fantastical elements with harsh reality with elegant prose that never comes off as pretentious, as stories of this nature have a tendency to do.  This is definitely one of the more solid collections I've read in a long time.

"The Baretts are a normal suburban family.  They've got their issues, mainly financial, but there's nothing unusual about them.  Until strange things begin happening around the house.  Like a mess in the kitchen in the middle of the night.  The alarm going off for no reason.  The flocks of birds smashing into the window.  And that's just the beginning.  Before long, Lacy and Daniel begin to suspect that their home is being visited by beings from another world...who want to take their son with them.There's a lot of promise in DARK SKIES, which is why I deemed it worthy of reviewing.  (I normally don't review something if it's complete crud; I mean, why waste the words?)  The acting, for one, is solid all across the board, especially Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton as the parents struggling to understand what's going on.  Kudos also to the two child leads, Dakota Goyo and Kadan Rockett, and especially J.K. Simmons as an abduction expert (it's actually a very nuanced performance, considering he only has one scene).  There is also quite a lot of disturbing imagery, and a sense of claustrophobia that pervades the entire piece.  The premise writer/director Scott Stewart brought to the table was simple: what does a normal family go through when they face a growing tragedy they can't understand?That's the premise.  The execution...that's where things start to fall apart.  The first half of the film is pretty darn good; things slowly build and build.  Until the final act, where it just kind of becomes the creature feature you were afraid it would be.  I'm not sure how you do an alien abduction film without showing the aliens, but that would've been great; alien abduction as a metaphor for familial struggles is a nice idea, and that's where Stewart seems to be going.  The final act doesn't completely undo everything, but it makes you wonder what could've been, if instead of going for the jump scares and special effects, the filmmakers had decided to keep things unsettling and ambiguous.  But that probably wouldn't have sold well, huh?  Oh well.  DARK SKIES has a lot of promise, enough to make it worth checking out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V97TDM2NL3PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYGFC#wasThisHelpful","R1V97TDM2NL3PW","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seth MacFarlane is Albert, a cowardly sheep farmer (""I'm the guy in the crowd making fun of the hero's shirt"") living on the frontier.  He's grown to hate his life; after all, there's a million ways to die out there.  The only good thing he has going is Louise, until she gets fed up with his cowardice and starts shacking up with a wealthier, more-mustachioed gentleman.  With nothing left to hold him in Ol' Stump, Albert's about to head to San Francisco...until he meets the beautiful, quick-witted Anna, who promises to help him make Louise jealous and get her back.  Except Anna has a little secret: she's married to the deadliest gunfighter in the territory, and he's on his way to town.I can see how A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST isn't for everyone; it's a bit over the top in spots, much like MacFarlane's FAMILY GUY and AMERICAN DAD have been in recent seasons.  (Fortunately, however, these moments are brief.)  And the film drags in spots, surprisingly.  It's so funny when it's on, that during the more serious moments, time seems to drag.Still, MILLION WAYS is absolutely worth your time if you're at all a fan of MacFarlane's, or if you love hard-R comedies that actually have some intelligence behind them.  The film is not only hilarious; it looks and feels like a western, much the same way BLAZING SADDLES did. I'm not really comparing the two films; MacFarlane and company didn't set out to make another masterpiece, they just wanted to have a little fun.  And they did.  Solid acting from all involved, quick-witted jokes and some nice slapstick, and beautiful cinematography help carry the film.  In case you're wondering: MacFarlane's wit helps carry him; he probably couldn't do someone else's comedy, but he's the master of his own.  And he's surrounded himself with a cast (Liam Neeson, Neil Patrick Harris, Amanda Seyfried, Charlize Theron, Sarah Silverman, and Giovanni Ribisi prime among them) that's on the same page he is.  (Also look for the cameos.  And for some, you'll definitely have to look.)  Is this a new classic?  Nope.  But it's a movie you'll want to watch every now and then for a few solid yucks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37RE1MQH7RBT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM9MP9I#wasThisHelpful","R37RE1MQH7RBT7","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, while examining the property, Michael discovers some old photos and film.  It feels like someone is playing a game with them.  Could it be the reservation security personnel, who had no idea Chris was squatting?  Could it be the junkies, whom Chris owes money?  Or could it be something else, something a little more supernatural?RESOLUTION has its flaws.  It never truly makes much sense, which is perhaps the most unforgivable Indie horror sin.  The plot feels stretched out; this is a 90 minute film that could've been 75 or so, easily.  However, despite these (admittedly critical) faults, RESOLUTION has an absolutely fantastic atmosphere; things never feel very safe, as though at any second the whole world could be knocked out of whack.  And the lead actors have outstanding chemistry; their friendship keeps the film going, even when things (maybe?) begin spiraling out of hand.  I can't recommend RESOLUTION to everyone, because it certainly doesn't appeal to mass audiences.  But for those who like horror films that stick around a while, that go for more atmospheric scares as opposed to jump scares, then this one is at least worth a shot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D3HJQEL34ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DT55P80#wasThisHelpful","R2D3HJQEL34ID","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Justin Towne's Earle's father, Steve Earle, made a career out of writing about hard-luck hillbillies, men who've come to a crossroads in their lives, politically and economically.  Earle (Jr.) has followed a similar career path, except he tackles the emotional roadblocks faced by the pre-millennial generation.All of his albums tend to focus around this theme; HARLEM RIVER BLUES remains his best (I'd rank it as one of the best overall albums of the past 20 years, but that's my opinion), but SINGLE MOTHERS is a welcome entry into his cannon.  Per usual, Earle sings about the different spectrums of commitment, this time set against bluesy/rock melodies.  All of the songs are strong, though some have a few weak points shining through (""Worried About the Weather,"" for example, revolves around a rather weak pun).  Still, this is an album to listen to while you sit back, sip some cheap wine (or maybe an imported beer), and smoke a couple cigarettes.  In other words: it's exactly what you expect from Justin Townes Earle.  Solid songcraft, relatable and poetic lyrics, and a pervasive atmosphere that ultimately comes across as optimistic, no matter how sad it tries to seem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GET10WYRXV64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXPKYZW#wasThisHelpful","R2GET10WYRXV64","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Personally, I think he tends to get overrated; he's written one brilliant book (HAUNTED) and another pretty good book that spawned a far-better movie (FIGHT CLUB).  His others, you can take or leave.  BEAUTIFUL YOU is a stronger effort.  It's quick, it's entertaining.  It's gross and perverted and a straight jab to the underbelly of modern American society.  It's meant to be something of a mockery of the 50 SHADES OF GREY phenomenon (dear God, casual readers, your taste is awful), but at times actually seems to sink down to that level.  That's what has always bugged me about Palahniuk's work; often times, he becomes (if only momentarily) the thing he's trying to mock.That said, BEAUTIFUL YOU is certainly a must for Palahniuk fans.  If you haven't read him before, steer clear; I mean, by this late date, if you're at all into this kind of thing, you've at least perused a copy of FIGHT CLUB.  Or maybe not, and you're just now broadening your tastes; in which case, I'd say start with HAUNTED, check out FIGHT CLUB 'cause you pretty much have to, and then give BEAUTIFUL YOU a shot.

"In this beautifully wrought novel that spans generations, Patrick Flanery takes us inside the lives of Nathanial and Julia Noailles, a family moving from Boston, seeking a new future for themselves and their young son.  They settle in an abandoned subdivision, done in by its troubled creator/designer, Paul Krovik.  But the story of the land goes back even further, to the early twentieth century, and the gruesome crimes that occurred there.In FALLEN LAND, Flanery's prose saves the day.  He is a careful, meticulous writer, creating gothic overtones in this novel rooted firmly in America's heartland.  It's slow, at times; almost abysmally slow, in fact, so much so that at moments I thought about giving up.  But I held on, and I'm glad I did, because of Flanery's way with characterization.  I'm not a big fan of novels with this much scope; I feel they have a tendency to focus on the bigger picture.  Flanery keeps things intimate, almost claustrophobic, because his real character is the landscape, and the stories that spring forth from it.  FALLEN LAND is definitely worth your time.

Yet, he manages to have several famous clients, including renowned stage actor Ralph Meir, who dies abruptly and tragically, with much of the scrutiny falling upon Schlosser.  And yet, it all harkens back to the previous summer, when Marc, his wife Caroline, and their two daughters vacationed at Meier's summer home, in love with the idea of a beautiful pool, a little getaway, and the fascination they both had with Meier's unbridled desire for Caroline.Herman Koch's THE DINNER was a revelation, a novel far more horrifying than most ""horror"" novels I've ever read; a novel without a single bit of gore, without any of the traditional genre elements, that managed to be humanly, realistically terrifying in its moral implications.  I read it as a double-feature with Ellis's AMERICAN PSYCHO and had nightmares for weeks.  SUMMER HOUSE WITH SWIMMING POOL continues DINNER's ""questionable"" narrator thread, except it's a little too blunt, a little too in-your-face.  DINNER took its time building up its characters; Schlosser starts out as repulsive and only gets more so.  Technically, that's the point, but it makes SUMMER HOUSE a little less enjoyable to read; the impact isn't as lasting, since it doesn't take as long to build.Overall, SUMMER HOUSE WITH SWIMMING POOL is worth a read or two (I'll definitely be diving back in, to see if I just missed something); but if you haven't read THE DINNER, start there first, then see if you want to progress.  If you have already read Koch's previous gem, then you should probably check this one out and judge for yourself.

SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES in a hilarious, often poignant exploration of death--primarily here in the States, but also from around the world.  Doughty doesn't shy away from taboo topics such as cannibalism, and she isn't afraid to get sentimental when the mood is right.  At times, the book doesn't quite know what it wants to be--essay or memoir--but for the most part, Doughty balances things well, giving us an insightful, somewhat disturbing glimpses into an aspect of culture our society tends to shun.

"Alexandra Hemingway is a tough NYC homicide detective, born into privilege, but chose to work her way up through the police ranks.  She's seen her share of violence.  She doesn't take s*** from anyone.  And now she's pregnant. But before she can digest this news, the mutilated body of a small child washes ashore in the East River.  And then another.  And another.Robert Pobi's AMERICAN WOMAN is a dark, bloody rollercoaster.  It's truly visceral; yes, there's blood and guts, but the true horror stems from the atmosphere Pobi has created.  This is a book where you definitely don't expect everyone to dance off happily ever after.  The only true problem is Pobi's plot, which throws in so many twists and red herrings, they get old after a while.  In fact, the plot never truly makes all that much sense.  In the end, maybe that's a deal-breaker for you; but there's enough atmosphere--and solid writing to back it up--in AMERICAN WOMAN to make it, if nothing else, a uniquely interesting thriller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK8860JX0DJQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477818219#wasThisHelpful","RK8860JX0DJQX","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Theodore is a lonely, depressed individual who hasn't gotten over his divorce.  He spends his life writing letters for others, living love lives he can only fantasize about.  He spends his nights playing interactive video games and talking to sex chat lines.  Until he discovers the OS 1.  Enter Samantha: an engaging, intelligent woman with a quick wit and an avid curiosity about the world.  The only problem: she's an operating system.Spike Jonze's HER is a beautiful, moving film about humanity and technology, and the tedious intersection of the two that society is rapidly approaching.  The movie features captivating performances; Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal is haunting and human, at times painful to watch (Theodore is a sympathetic character, but not always likable).  As Samantha, Scarlet Johansson conveys a full range of emotions with her voice alone; this is voice acting as it should be.  (Same goes for the other voice actors in the film with their bit parts, especially Kristen Wiig, writer/director Jonze, and Brian Cox in their cameo roles.)  Amy Adams helps round out the supporting cast, in her portrayal and Theodore's neighbor/childhood friend Amy, and Rooney Mara in a bit role as Theodore's ex.  Backing up the performances are a solid script and directing.  I haven't always enjoyed Jonze's films, but I've never doubted that he makes the movies he wants to make; he is a true craftsman.What truly anchors HER, however, are is its overarching theme of what advances in technology mean to humanity.  Yes, this is a thematic film; however, it's also touching and surprisingly hilarious.  Yes, it will--or should--get you thinking; that's what Jonze is trying to do.  But it's also simply a funny film, with heart and soul and all those other little things that make a movie memorable.  It's a bit long for its own good (maybe twenty minutes or so), but HER is definitely a movie to watch, enjoy, and ponder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGHUG3MZYA9D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9HZGQ0#wasThisHelpful","RGHUG3MZYA9D8","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ben is a security guard at an Atlanta high school, who's just been accepted to the police academy.  The only catch?  His girlfriend's dominating, intimidating super-cop brother, James.  In an effort to discourage Ben, James decides to take his would-be brother-in-law on a ride along, all while tracking down mysterious criminal kingpin Omar.I don't like a lot of his films, but I'm a pretty big Kevin Hart fan; he's got comedic timing that you rarely see these days.  And there's no denying that no one does tough like Ice Cube.  The two have pretty good chemistry, too, and their scenes together are among RIDE ALONG's best.  Also along is a surprisingly strong supporting cast: John Leguizamo, Bruce McGill, Bryan Callen, and especially Laurence Fishburne.  Unfortunately, they are hindered by a so-so script that goes from super-budget action (in the first five minutes, Ice Cube drives a souped up pickup through an explosion, and while it's a draw-dropping effect, our disbelief can only be suspended too far), to rom-com, to bromance, to...well, you get the idea.  RIDE ALONG doesn't quite know what it wants to be.  The best scenes have a feel of improvisation (you can see Ice Cube on the verge of laughter multiple times), where the story takes a backseat to the actors' chemistry.  This film is good for killing a couple of hours, but I won't go to great effort to see it again.  Give it a shot if you'd like a few chuckles, but there are better buddy-cop comedies out there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9YTH1BSK9BD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX0KIAM#wasThisHelpful","R1R9YTH1BSK9BD","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Matthew Corbett is a professional ""problem solver"" in 18th century America.  His latest assignment: to travel all the way from New York City to Charles Town, tasked with escorting a beautiful young woman to a local dance.  Sounds simple, but things rarely are, and Corbett finds himself amongst yet another mystery, in a hauntingly beautiful landscape built around a river referred to as The River of Souls.I'll be honest with you up front: I had no idea the Matthew Corbett character had been continued.  I read the SPEAKS THE NIGHTBIRD back when it came out, after McCammon's decade-long hiatus from fiction.  I enjoyed it, though not as much as his earlier works.  Then, apparently, I lost track.  I still maintain that some of McCammon's earlier work ranks among the best in the horror genre; I returned, just a few months ago, to THE WOLF'S HOUR, and loved it every bit as much as I remembered.  Spectacular characterization.  Fascinating plot.  Harrowing action and suspense.  And, above all, excellent writing.THE RIVER OF SOULS is not excellently written.  The plot is solid, and kept me reading, but...well, this just isn't the same writer who wrote those excellent past novels.  The writing is lazy.  The characterization is lazy.  The setting, the plot, all of that shines--but RIVER definitely feels like a series book written exclusively to entertain series fans.  Which, to that extent, I'm sure it succeeds.  But judging by what McCammon has given us in the past, he's capable of so much more than riding the coattails of a guaranteed readership.  THE RIVER OF SOULS was a disappointment; perhaps the best thing about it is that it encouraged me to pick up copies of McCammon's novels that I haven't read in years.

"PREFACE: I haven't seen the original.  I try not to compare remakes to the originals anyways, unless they're by-the-numbers remakes designed solely to make a little cash.  This film comes across as a true labor of love, so I feel I'm justified in giving it an unbiased review.Walter Mitty works in the cellars of LIFE magazine, and his job may be on the line: a trio of bearded wonderboys (headed by snob-for-hire Adam Scott) has come strolling in with the news that the magazine is switching to online-only, and a lot of people are about to be out of their jobs.  Walter, who spends equal parts of his time daydreaming about the person he'd like to be, and fantasizing about the woman of his dreams whom he can barely talk to, is sure to get axed.  Especially when famed photographer Sean O'Connell sends in his latest snaps...with his most cherished picture missing.So Walter takes a leap of faith and pursues O'Connell across the globe, and this is where the film begins to fall apart.  Don't get me wrong: it's incredibly easy to root for Walter.  Writer/director Ben Stiller portrays him perfectly, a nuanced performance that is a bit by-the-numbers, but Stiller has enough charisma (especially with costar Kristen Wiig) that it's hard not to like him.  However, the film is at its strongest when it's portraying Walter as a day-dreaming everyman, an ordinary schmuck who doesn't realize his full potential.  THIS is the heart of the film (and, hence, the title).  When Walter impulsively starts acting out his fantasies, we begin to lose touch.  The film strays away from its point.  Cue the dramatic music and endearing scenes of self-fulfillment.THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY gets one thing right from start to finish: it looks fantastic.  I mean amazing.  The film slips seamlessly from fantasy to reality, a polished cinematic gem burdened mainly by its script.  The acting is solid and the direction is near-flawless; yet the film ultimately undermines its own purpose.  Which is a shame, because there's so much to like here.  Even if it's your typical ""feel good"" movie, there's still enough here to make it worth your while.  But with the talent behind it, it could have been much, much better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HNOOR7YDGLRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7KJTCG#wasThisHelpful","R2HNOOR7YDGLRY","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should preface this review by saying I didn't pay any money to see this film; a friend bought it and wanted to watch it one night.  If I'd rented it myself or watched it in the theaters (or, God forbid, bought it unsuspectingly), I'd probably give it only 1 star.  So keep that in the back of your mind as you read on.The film follows newlyweds Samantha and Zach (Allison Miller and Zach Gilford, who do an adequate job fulfilling their roles, at least by genre standards).  They go south of the border for their honeymoon, and for some reason wander into an out-of-the-way psychic's shop for a palm reading.  Then leave in a hurry and wander through a part of town usually inhabited by people who kidnap tourists.  Needless to say, something bad happens, and Sam becomes pregnant with a devil baby, and then starts acting weird, and eviscerating deer, all under the spell of a symbol eerily reminiscent of the video game QUAKE.DEVIL'S DUE is typical of a found-footage horror film, in that it has mildly-wooden acting, overall poor effects, no logical plot whatsoever, and no adequate reason why the camera should always be on.  Also: if the lead couple would just turn on the lights once in a while, things might've turned out a little differently.  There are a couple of decent jump scares, and actually some truly interesting imagery, especially during the Devil rape scene and again during the climax.  But these alone probably aren't worth your time.  Give DEVIL'S DUE a chance if you enjoy this type of film (and I mean truly enjoy it).  But I wouldn't put much effort into viewing it, or put too much money down.  In the words of my friend who bought it: ""That movie just sucked.""  I won't go that far...but I wouldn't say it's too off the mark, either.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GN5P0FVO1YHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJS2NZU#wasThisHelpful","R2GN5P0FVO1YHQ","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rodney Crowell's best albums--THE HOUSTON KID and FATE'S RIGHT HAND spring immediately to mind--are personal, deeply-felt albums wrought with heart, humor, and all the grit you find under a workingman's fingernails.  Crowell has rarely shied away from telling it like it is; he's one of the few songwriters you can trust, time and again, to paint the picture true, even if it's not entirely right.On the whole, TARPAPER SKY falls in line with Crowell's impressive, decades' long body of work.  The opening track could've come from either of the previously-mentioned albums.  The closer, ""God What a Beautiful World,"" would fit right at home on Crowell's previous solo project, SEX & GASOLINE.  The slow-rolling (think Don Williams) creole anthem ""Fever on the Bayou"" perhaps sums up Crowell best: a melody like a warm summer breeze, filled with tongue-in-cheek poetry laced with naughtiness.  ""Diamonds and dirt,"" to quote a prior Crowell record.If TARPAPER SKY has one major strike against it, it's that, unlike Crowell's best stuff, these songs don't entirely congeal into an album.  What makes some of his previous albums so unforgettable is the way the songs string together, thematically or melodically.  TARPAPER almost feels piecemeal.  Each song on its own shines, to varying degrees; but the journey is stilted, as the songs never coalesce into a larger overall picture.  Still, for Crowell fans, this is a must-have album.  Perhaps it's not his best--but like anything by a master craftsman, you'll still want to get your hands on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CZDB4TGKFYNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILSIY7E#wasThisHelpful","R1CZDB4TGKFYNG","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm fairly new to baseball.  In my late twenties, but I just started following the sport a few years ago, and have only started binging on baseball history and trivia in the past year.  That said, even I know that Pete Rose was a hell of a player.  Fierce.  Competitive.  Gracefully clumsy.  Like a terrier going after the ball.And then the gambling.  Big at the time--kind of pales next to things that have come out regarding other players since.  Rose is banned for life, meaning this Hall of Fame-worthy player will never get to enter, while others who took performance enhancing drugs stand a legitimate chance.  Still, as they say, rules is rules.  Is it right or is it wrong?That's partly the issue here, though it's one that author Kostya Kennedy skirts around.  Mostly, Kennedy busies himself by portraying Rose as honestly as he can.  This means profanity and humor, heart and surprisingly callousness.  Rose is a multi-faceted individual, and Kennedy tries to show us all of the man's sides, without ever settling on one.  Still, it's clear that he's in favor of leniency, and at times this bias pokes its head through and pushes you out of the story.  Aside from those (admittedly rare) moments, PETE ROSE: AN AMERICAN DILEMMA is a fascinating account of one of the most enigmatic and polarizing sports figures of all time.

"The 1970s are gone, and they've left Ron Burgundy and crew behind. Emotionally bereft and out of a job, Ron gets offered the chance to go to New York and partake in the bourgeoning 24 hour news scene.  He recruits his old partners and crimes and heads out...only to find the world isn't what he thought it was. He's not a big shot here.  And furthermore, stuck in the graveyard shift (""I ain't afraid of no ghost""), he's suddenly confronted with a dilemma: to report the news...or report things people will actually listen to?ANCHORMAN is one of the great comedies of the past couple decades.  Hell, it may be one of the great comedies of all time. It defined a generation. If you don't know a line from it, you're wrong--you know one, you just don't know it's from that movie.  ANCHORMAN 2 has two great flaws: one, it tries to be as good as the first; and two, it was originally released a PG-13.  This is hard-R material (thank God there's the R-rated version; my immediate instinct on seeing the film for the first time was that the trailer had all the funnier jokes), and deserves hard-R delivery.  Some of the jokes are stale; others are just blatantly vulgar, utterly missing the point of what made the first film so hilarious (the jokes in the original were both crude AND charming).  Also, as Steve Carell's fame has risen, so has Brick Tamblan's role.  Brick is hilarious as a supporting character; given his own subplot, Brick becomes a little too much (though as a foil for Carell's character, Kristen Wiig is spot-on).But, when the film hits, it hits.  Case in point: the cameos.  Oh Lord, the cameos.  From A-listers you wouldn't expect to show up for 15 seconds.  The film starts out with one (most reviews I read gave it away, but I won't), and then just piles them on.  Extended supporting turns from Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Christina Applegate, Meagan Good, James Marsden, Greg Kinnear, and the above-mentioned Wiig are great (especially the original crew, who haven't lost their chemistry).  And Ferrell, surprisingly, is still game; his performances are hit-and-miss for me, and here he's not quite as good as in the first, but it's still a funny performance, with just a touch (perhaps too much) of heart.  The jokes come fast and hard; they don't all click (dare I say, more fail than most), but the film gets stronger in its third act.Ultimately, ANCHORMAN 2 is an unnecessary sequel; and, if you're going to give us a sequel to such a seminal film, make it stand on its own two legs.  ANCHORMAN 2 does not.  But it's worth your time; if you enjoyed the first, watch this one, especially the R-rated version.  In fact, only watch that version.  You won't laugh as hard as you did a few years ago, but you might still have a damn fine time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHAQ9OCFSRGPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083XXWRE#wasThisHelpful","RHAQ9OCFSRGPS","AEQFYOI6YJ83Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Olin is ostensibly here for research, though underneath lay more personal motives that delve back into his family's history.There's a bitterness in IN PARADISE that's rewarding, and also a complexity.  But the book struggles to keep the plot going.  Even in ""literary"" works, there needs to be a clear plot.  We don't really have one, just characters and commentary.  And maybe it's a personal touch, but I find present-tense works extremely distracting.  Yeah, that probably is personal taste.  The fact is, if you like Peter Matthiessen, you're probably going to like this one no matter what I say.  Give it a shot.

"Dr. Genevieve Leonard is an insurance investigator, skilled at seeing patterns and sniffing out fraud.  Now there's a phrase which would confuse her: how, exactly, does one smell fraud?

Dead poets and a conspiracy at the highest level are woven into this story - along with a giant goon named Vinny whose best friend breaks into Genevieve's house and installs Vinny as her bodyguard.

"Heavier plastic than some of the other products I've tried, although I'm not positive this is quite as thick as the name brand rolls of sealing material.  It does work well for sealing a variety of different products; I've used it for things like boneless turkey breast, with seasoning and vegetables, so the flavors meld.  You can make a very large bag to create a way to marinate chicken cutlets or similar cuts, and either put the sealed bag in the refrigerator for some time or even freeze it so the marinade flavors the meat as it thaws.  I've also used it for cuts of cheese; it's great for keeping mold from forming.  The only thing I watch as I'm sealing it is that my food sealer doesn't suck all of the liquid out of meats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TR5CO82LBW1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1OM7TO#wasThisHelpful","R1TR5CO82LBW1A","A17DW6SUOC70DJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17DW6SUOC70DJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to replace the slicer I've had for a decade, which had needed replacement for a while, but I delayed until the motor burned up.  This is a fairly heavy unit, with a cast base.  It's easy to take apart for cleaning; truth be told, after I remove the blade and the adjustable back plate, I put it in the sink and hose around the blade and base to be sure I've gotten all of the meat grub out of it, then turn it on end to let it drain thoroughly and grease the gears before I reassemble the blade and stow it.  I use this for slicing roasts, including pork, beef and boneless turkey breast.  I don't try to get deli thin slices, just nice, thin slices suitable for the dinner plate.  When you have to slice 3 to 6 pound roasts, as I do to properly feed my hungry hordes (depending upon how many are home), a slicer is a great time saver.  The carriage rests on a slightly slanted base, which helps to keep the meat in the right location.  The thickness guide is marked in 25 divisions, and it is capable of cutting something to about 1"" thick.  I've never tried it on bread or anything other than cooked meat, but I suspect it would work just fine on raw meat, and I think it might need a different blade to keep from tearing or crushing the bread.  It is a pretty big unit, so you need to have some storage space for it, but if you have to slice a lot of meat, it's a great time saver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R136ZJN75SWQU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002AKCOC#wasThisHelpful","R136ZJN75SWQU2","A17DW6SUOC70DJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17DW6SUOC70DJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We recently decided to replace a 1952 toilet with a new one.  The snag was that (a) the 1952 had a 10"" distance from wall to drain, while the new one had a 12"" distance, and (b) the new one needed to move slightly to the right of where the 1952 model was.  This solved the problem; this closet flange could be attached to the PVC drain pipe and turned at an angle to allow both of the offsets we needed, enabling us to put down a new wax ring and set the new toilet in place.  It was a lot better solution than the plumber's idea, which was, ""Hey, let's just tear out the living room ceiling below the bathroom, and I can run all new pipes and do this job right!""

"I am a self employed landscaper in the southeastern US. Summers are brutally humid here. These shirts were only $20 so I purchased two of them. When I first put it on was concerned the embroidered Columbia logo would itch or scratch my chest when working, but I never noticed it at all. These shirts wick moisture as well as anything I've ever tried (coolmax, capilene, goretex, etc). I sweat constantly and the shirt dries continuously. From the moment you put it on it feels silky and cool against the skin. I'm 6ft tall and 200 lbs with broad shoulders and an athletic build and the XXL works great for me, leaving enough tail to tuck in if I like. Feels awesome while backpacking since my back stays cool and there is almost no friction between the straps and shirt, thus eliminating shoulder hotspots.Other reviewers have expressed concerns and displeasure over the durability of these shirts, such as their Ipod strap or some tree picked up their polyester shirt a little bit so they feel it is ruined. They can feel that way, but these are tough shirts and I'll tell you why. I use chainsaws to cut trees down on a weekly basis, I'm constantly being slapped, smacked, swatted, grabbed and flat knocked down sometimes branches. Sure the polyester sometimes gets caught, thus it ""pulls"" or ""picks"", but that's what polyester does. I have $65-$70 golf shirts that picked up worse than these... and that was golfing. I consider those to be ""dress"" shirts so some might say they are ruined.Just the other day I cleared 140' of fence of briars and other scrub bushes. All day with a chainsaw and brush ax. Sure I got hung up and the shirt picked up a bit, but they still don't have any holes after a couple months of almost daily wear. If you are more concerned with how you look doing something than what you are actually doing, or if you armor all your truck/suv tires, you may want to try something else. Bottom line, if you work hard and play hard outside and just want a high performance moisture wicking T-shirt and don't care about how you look doing it, get this shirt. I'm ordering more today!

"Well I waited three months to give my assessment on the magnatab. Save you money.

It possible to get all the balls down, but then some won't come back up, and when they do, they won't stay in place. If this toy cost $5 it would be fine, but at about $20.... keep looking.

We start off on the high setting for about a half hour and she then turns it down to the middle setting. It stays there for a couple hours until I go to bed and turn it down to the yellow ""nightlight"" setting. It still shines as bright as when we first put Duracells in it. So far we're 60 days and counting on the battery life with nightly usage. Very bright lantern. Seems to be weather resistant as advertised.

"I had been treating my English Pointer's ear with peroxide to treat a suspected infection. It wasn't working too well as I was having to swab the ear out with Q-tips daily. The ear was producing a foul smelling dark and oily substance at an alarming rate. I treated using this method for about two months and was close to having to by stock in Q-tips. I ordered this and treated the ear twice daily for five days. The ear showed signs of clearing up within 48 hours and the foul smell was less noticeable. The ear was completely clear, clean and pink again after five days of treatment. No more foul smell either. That was about three months ago. My pointer is so much happier now that he isn't shaking his head every five minutes. I highly recommend this if your dog has some kind of ""ear yuck"" you feel may be an infection.

"My how headlamps have come a long way. I still have my original, THE original Petzl Tikka headlamp. I admit it may have lost ""some"" brightness over the years, although not much, this Black Diamond Wiz headlamp rivals it in every way. My three and a half year old daughter got this for Christmas and absolutely loves it. She is always ""stealing"" my headlamps and flashlights, so she got a pink one from Santa.The band is plenty adjustable for even some adults to wear. The button has little tactile feel to it, but rather feels almost like a touch screen. I'm just accustomed to a stiff click, but this unit is designed with kids in mind so I'm fine with it and my daughter could care less. I mainly got this unit because of the automatic shutoff. Seemed like every time I needed one of my mini lights, the batteries were dead and that was provided I could find one at all. We found two small flashlights which had dropped behind her bed when we rearranged her room a while back.

"This was fun clay to work with and has no unpleasant odor like a no name brand I purchased from ""Wallyworld"". My three and a half year old got this in her stocking for Christmas. We have gotten tired of how play doh dries out so quickly, although I rejuvenate it with a little canola oil. This clay blends very well to make new colors. It molds readily especially after being warmed by rolling in the palms, but it does not bond to itself readily. I did not try concocting any sort of ""slip"" to use as glue, but I may try that on the next miniature coil bowl we try to make.It does not dry out or harden. I've had some leftover laying out for 5 days now, and it as well as the sculptures we made on Christmas day are still quite pliable. We made a bunch of snowmen and women with garden hats. We did need to use sections of bamboo skewers as an internal frame to support the clay.I will say that unlike play doh, this clay sticks a little bit to various surfaces, and the color does transfer a little bit to hands and fingers, but nothing permanent. No experience yet with it getting into clothing or carpet, but I promise I will update on the results if and when that happens. I plan on getting more of this clay just for when we go out of town or on vacation so our daughter has something a little more tactile to play with than her Leap Pad 2.

"This is one of those great products that no one ever hears about because the Razor line just about has the market cornered. Yes those are less expensive, but if you purchase this maxi kick scooter at the right time for your child (about 3 years or so), it will end up being a very inexpensive toy over time. I paid $130 for this neon pink/black maxi kick scooter, and I figure it should last my three and a half year old another eight years plus.... that's only $16 dollars a year.The maxi scooter measures 24 in. high at it's lowest setting and that suits my 41 in. daughter very well. I almost purchased the mini kick, but so glad now that I didn't since the maxi is adjustable and has a slightly larger platform.I will concede this scooter is made in China just as the Razors are, but the components on the kick line of scooters are much better quality... the wheels, bearings, etc.The steering column does not fold down, but rather locks into place, or is removed with a ""push"" button mechanism. It can be a bit awkward to push the button to remove the column. I find that a small flat-head screwdriver works well for this. The height adjustment is a simple, but reliable quick release. The hand grips are really rubbery and provide excellent grip. The deck has no grip tape, but does seem to provide adequate slip protection as my daughter was riding through puddles yesterday. The deck has just the amount of flex one might expect a child's scooter to have, which really helps the carving effect one gets from the unique steering mechanism. The front wheels have a camber to them when turning.... think Can-Am roadster. The wheels are super smooth and ultra quiet on our hardwood, tile carpet, and outside on pavement.I was a little worried about my girl not getting the hang of the rear brake, but boy was I wrong. Once I showed it to her, she immediately began practicing with it. We had a couple rainy days at Christmas, so she got to practice inside before heading out. She seemed really confident right from the start. I'm so glad we paid a little more and went with the front three wheeled design. Our neighbor's child got a rear three wheeled scooter and she is constantly kicking the rear wheels when she pushes, regardless of which foot she uses. My girl is able to take big long confident strides when she pushes without kicking any wheels.If you are reading this debating between the maxi or mini, your child is probably going to fit the maxi at it's lowest setting. If you are here debating between a front or rear three wheeled design, I promise your child will be happier with this design if given the choice. Micro Mobility started out designing scooters for adults, and have since delivered a well designed quality line of children's scooters. It really is a great little scooter, and in my opinion far superior to the half a dozen different scooters belonging to the children in this cul-de-sac.**UPDATE 11-24-2014**Scooter is holding up great. Very well built. All the other kids in the neighborhood love to ride it because of the two wheels in front design, along with the built in 'camber'. I would buy this over again in a heartbeat. I've only raised the handle up about an inch from last year, so I firmly believe it will last our daughter for seven more years.

"I originally purchased this shovel about 6 years ago from Lowe's like many other reviewers. I used this shovel for work at the time, which was installing Invisible fences for canine containment. I used this shovel 5 days a week for 3 years, and it served me well. It blew all other shovels out of the water when it came to digging fine trench work for burying wire. When most shovels would ""taco"" in half when trying to dig in some of the semi-frozen clay soils around here in winter, this shovel never folded up. I still keep the shovel on my landscape trailer.The oversize steps on either side of the shovel have a little traction, but I added some grip tape to the steps a couple times a year as it would wear off. The half star deduction is for the handle being attached by only a single screw. That became loose soon after putting it to full time use, so I drove two more small sheet metal screws above and below the stock screw, and they have held very tight for years.Thankfully Amazon carries this shovel, because all of my local Lowe's have stopped selling this particular product, and I need two for Christmas gifts for buddies of mine that always wanted one, but would never spend the extra money themselves. Those guys would rather buy two or three cheap shovels a year, but in my opinion this tool is the perfect combination of trenching shovel, sharpshooter shovel, transfer and digging shovels. I currently own 7 different shovels (self employed landscaper) and if I could only carry one with me, this would be the one.I suggest adding two sheet metal screws to the back of the handle as soon as you purchase this shovel, as this will mitigate any chances of the handle coming off. I personally found the grip tape to be a great benefit, but I worked in ALL weather conditions back then.

"This little unicorn is just as described. It is somewhat small, as the description indicates it measures 3.7 x 0.9 x 2.6 inches. It seems to be made of a plastic/vinyl similar to so many of the little vinyl toy figurines, so it has a small bit of flexibility to it. This should keep it from breaking. It has all the detail of a ceramic style figurine. She has realistic hair texture, good muscle definition, as well as detailed mouth and nostrils. You can even tell she is a baby unicorn due the shorter horn and lanky legs, and at $3.50 plus fair shipping charges I feel this will make a great stocking stuffer.The unicorn does not come in a ""blister"" style package, but in a bag like a happy meal toy, which is fine, just thought it was worth mentioning.

"This UC M48 Talon spear is pretty awesome, if not perfect for my primary use. I hunt boar in the swamps and floodplains outside Columbia SC. I use this spear as a backup to my Smith & Wesson model 625. My family has traditionally hunted hogs with revolvers, and .45 caliber or not, it's still only six shots. The dogs usually handle any hog we come across with no problems, but as a last line of defense, I have always carried a large knife (Tops Condor Alert) but lets face it, who wants to go hand to hoof with a hog.I find the length of this spear to be perfect. I understand why some would want a longer handle so it can double as a hiking stick, but me personally, I keep it strapped to the back of a M.O.L.L.E. vest with a couple of custom formed pieces of Kydex attached to the vest. This setup allows my to ""quick-draw"" the spear like an arrow from a quiver. The shorter length keeps it from getting snagged on brush and undergrowth, but still gives me 7 feet of reach if you include my arm.The slightly blade heavy design is great for thrusting and has plenty of ""heft"" to easily pierce a hog. The sheath leaves something to be desired, so I made a new leather sheath out of an old baseball glove from Goodwill.I have honestly only thrown it a couple of times, and those throws were just chance encounters with rabbits. The spear threw pretty good to about twenty or so feet, although we did not eat fire roasted rabbit, the spear and blade was no worse for the wear. My M48 has been quite the topic around a few campfires and I have no doubt I have helped sell at least a couple of these because of that.Bottom line... If you plan on this doubling as a hiking staff... forget about it. But, if you hunt any large game with a revolver, or hunt in bear country for any game, the M48 add a little extra peace of mind.

"I purchased this off a clearance shelf from ""Wallyworld"" on a whim one day. It sat around the shed for months until I used it on my pitchfork to unload and help spread six cubic yards of cypress mulch. What a back saver! It was most useful for the transfer of mulch from the trailer to the wheelbarrow and mulching was much easier this year. Adjustments, installation, and removal are all very easy thanks to the spade-head thumb screws. I have also used it on my transfer shovel loading sand and gravel off my driveway, which brings me to best uses and limitations.It worked better on my transfer shovel than it did on my digging shovel. It would be great for snow and transfer shovels, pitchforks, and replacement grips for gas powered trimmers. I would not recommend this for rakes, or digging implements, as it will just get in the way. It is made of a tough thermoplastic and has shown it can take some abuse.

The ""chip-clip"" style clamp does a surprisingly good job of staying in place on my Ibanez acoustic and I *think* my guitar sounds better than it did while using my previous tuner.The user interface is very simple, and the display is easy to read and understand in both higher and lower lighting conditions. The instruction manual is adequate, but the SN-1 seemed very intuitive for me to use. The product arrived on time, as shown, well packaged, for what I believe to be a fair price at about eight dollars and change. I've had this SN-1 for a couple months now, and will update this review down the road.

"These are excellent gloves to have around the house. I originally purchased mine at Lowe's, and they have served me well for over three years. I have used them to: glue PVC together, scrub bathrooms, apply varnish and stains, pressure wash the house, remove a dead bird, make tie-dyed stuff, pesticide and herbicide applications, every time I use Goo-Gone, apply floor tile mastic, and so many more things I can't remember right now.The gloves are somewhat thick, but articulated. They provide warmth when pressure washing in the cold. The textured palm surprisingly provides more than enough grip for most applications. I think these gloves are a must for every homeowner for sure.

"Well I've now had this back stretcher for about three months. As others have noted, it looks like the picture. I thought it would have some built in ""flex"" when I laid on it, but is actually pretty rigid due to the wooden internal frame. The ample padding mitigates any stiffness however. To adequately review the product, I feel I should first describe my back problems.First of all, I have three degenerating discs, between my ""L's"" 2 & 3, ""L's"" 3 & 4, and ""L's"" 4 & 5, caused from years of carrying heavy packs and sleeping in not so comfy locations. This mainly causes extreme tightness  with some pain in my lower back. My chiropractor is able to ""crack"" my lower back, but this device DOES NOT crack *my* lower back. It does however provide a high arch on which to slowly stretch out my back sometimes. I never do this in the morning, as my back is at its tightest, and if your back is really tight, this thing can hurt like crazy if you are not careful. I usually need to loosen my lower back up first before I can stretch it on this. Now, for the mid back...About two years ago, I dislocated the two right side ribs at my ""T"" 6 and ""T"" 7 vertebrae. No kidding, one of the most painful injuries I have ever experienced, and there have been many. At any rate, I spent almost a year going to my chiropractor, usually twice a week, before the ribs would finally start to stay in place on their own for any length of time. Now that the ribs are as good as they are going to get, I still have some residual discomfort which every so often requires a middle back adjustment from my chiropractor. This device DOES help me with this issue, as I often get one or two small little cracks in the area of my ""T"" 6 and ""T"" 7. Again this can be painful for me if I am not somewhat loosened up beforehand.Conclusion: I think this item will be a hit or miss depending on your particular back issues. I do like to put it behind my back sometimes when I find myself in my home office-chair, as the arch forces me to sit very straight. I am able to position the device anywhere along my spine, depending on where I lay on it. I use it two or three times a week for ten minutes or so at the time, and it is holding up nicely. I would advise using a small pillow under your head just like the instructions indicate, because it helps support your cervical vertebrae.I give three stars because as three stars denotes, I feel it is just OK. It is no substitute for a competent chiropractor, but it does a better job than most household objects at providing a little stretch for your back. Just be warned, if you suffer from real tightness (not muscular, but skeletal) in your back this device can really hurt you if you don't loosen up a little first.

"In the interest of full disclosure, this is the first guitar strap I have ever owned. That being said, the strap is fairly soft and pliable, with that almost broken in feel. I was expecting it to be a little stiffer, but I'm glad it isn't. It fit my Ibanez acoustic just fine. My guitar is nothing fancy, so I would presume the ""strap locks"" are pretty standard. The fit is really tight at first, so that should be a good thing. I suppose I could have unscrewed my strap locks to facilitate mounting the strap, but I didn't.The range of fit seems pretty good to me. I am 6' tall and wear my acoustic up a little high, kind of ""folk style"" I guess. If I want to, I can adjust it so that it rides lower around my pelvis area. One end is suede on both sides and has the tanned leather-logo patch on it, while the other end is black suede on one side and tan suede on the backside. I can't see it marring the guitar at all. It is comfortable around my neck and shoulder. Made in Canada, seems well built and durable. Once again my left shoe is happy to have its lace back, and Keith gets to keep his head fashionable.

"This is actually the first capo I have ever owned, as I am pretty new to playing the guitar. That being said, I paid close to $14 with free shipping for this capo, and I feel it is a good value.

"I purchased these for my wife as part of a Valentine's Day gift. She had only played golf twice before, sharing my clubs both times. Since she enjoyed it, I got this set, which fits her much better than mine did. Now that we have been playing together more often, I have received feedback from her about the clubs.First, she likes how lightweight the set is, as it is not cumbersome for her to manage. She is about 5'7"", and finds these clubs much easier to swing than mine. I notice she makes much less contact with the ground, especially with the driver, than she did with my clubs. Please keep in mind she is still learning the game, and more importantly how to swing the club properly while making good ball contact.I think this is a great beginner/entry level set of clubs. The set contains a 460cc driver with head cover (a little overwhelming still for my wife), a ""fairway"" wood and a 5 hybrid with head covers (she crushes both of these from the fairway), 6 and 7 irons (7 is my personal favorite club), a sand wedge (my wife's favorite club) , and a mallet style putter. I added an old 11 degree Callaway War-Bird driver to her bag, which she uses as her driver most of the time. The shafts are composite and the grips are pretty standard. Set includes: 7 clubs, 3 head covers, 1 bag.As a set, I feel it's not enough clubs to weigh my wife down, or overwhelm her when it comes to club selection, but all the distances one would need to play a round are in the bag. As she gets her swing down and adds a few shots to her bag of tricks, we may upgrade her set. Until then, she says she is very happy with these clubs and is glad she doesn't have as many as I have.

"I purchased these headphones mainly for my wife to use with her Yamaha PSR E333 keyboard, but of course I have been using them lately, and I will say they are a great value. My wife an I both have ""smallish"" ears, and these lightweight headphones fit perfectly. I think for anyone who has large or long ears may not find these to be comfortable.The ear cups adjust by sliding up or down at the point of connection. That connection also swivels a bit to allow for a nice custom feel. All the padding is super soft, but I could see it getting ripped if one were not careful. The cord seems well connected into the headphones and is at least 8 ft long. The little cord keeper that is included is just OK, but it functions. These headphones ""seal"" really well around my ears, so I have to be really careful to make sure and have my volume down before I put the headphones on, or they will really blast my eardrums. The sound......... These things sound amazing for a $25 pair of entry level headphones. When I first plugged them into my laptop and headed to YouTube, they seemed a bit muffled, so I pulled up my laptop's equalizer and was able to really get the headphones dialed in. I was able to get warm rich tones, high highs, and clear bass notes. They also do an excellent job of keeping the audio in the ear cups as my wife can't hear anything from four feet away. She loves them with the Yamaha keyboard. The included larger size adapter fit in the keyboard perfectly. The only con I can come up with is I didn't purchase them sooner.

"We had the original for years, and like many came to love the trackball. One of our dogs got tangled in the mouse cord and subsequently disconnected the internal wiring. Had a computer repair shop look at it but he couldn't repair it so I went online to buy a new one. I couldn't believe the $200-$400 asking prices for the discontinued trackball. Enter Amazon.After reading reviews on this product I was concerned about driver installation, but decided to give it a shot for $40. So happy I did. Installation was quick and flawless. Simply plug in the USB receiver and the mouse was recognized fairly quickly, although it took about 4-5 minutes before the mouse would actually function. I currently use a Toshiba L675 laptop with 64 bit Vista OS. The trackball speed was far too fast out of the box for my liking, so I went to the Logitech website and downloaded the software to customize the mouse settings. That was also easy, but you will need to know your OS properties in order to choose the correct download.I have had no issues with errant scrolling or anything else. I will surely update this review in a few months after more use. If you are a fan of the original trackball, you will love this too. It is close enough in size, weight, shape, and feel, that any differences are subtle. My one small gripe is the on the old trackball, I could pop the ball out of the bottom with my finger to clean it out. This trackball has a much narrower diameter hole, and so I need a pencil or something to pop the ball out. Other than that, I'm so happy I found this product. I plan on buying two more to stick in a drawer in case the same situation ever happens with this version. If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer.

"I purchased a 3 pack of the soft rubber wedgie's as an add-on to a larger order. As such, I found them to be a reasonable value. However, I'm not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic. I think these picks would be fantastic for classical or any other nylon string guitar or ""uke"". They are very grippy and have a slight concavity to them on one side for additional comfort.I love the very soft warm sound they provide.

"My old Wahl clippers were in need of replacement after about 12 years of bi-weekly hair cuts, so I naturally began reading reviews of clippers on Amazon. I had no reason to deviate from Whal as my brand of choice and felt this clipper kit would meet my needs, but I was a little leery of an online purchase after having read so many negative reviews about possibly having received used clippers. Another reviewer mentioned this item being sold at ""Wallyworld"" so I went and checked. Sure enough I found it for about $22 and change. Now the clipper....I have been shaving my whole head as close as I can get it (boot camp style) without using a straight/safety razor for twenty years. I am very happy with this clipper after a dozen or so cuts. I shave my head at the shortest setting sans any guards and it get so very close, but it has never ever nicked me. Included is a light green guard which feels like a ""soft"" silicon material. It is perfect for trimming ""sensitive areas"". The blades were sharp, aligned perfectly and in pristine condition. All the accessories were bagged separately inside the somewhat flimsy case.Over the years I have learned two things about clipper care: Always brush hair trimmings out of the clipper blades after each use, and regular oiling. That being said, the little ""cleaner"" brushes that come with almost all clipper are junk. Years ago I replaced mine with a cheap medium bristle toothbrush. It is much more effective at hair removal. Additionally, when you properly oil the blades and then use the toothbrush again a few times after oiling, you will then have a nice oil-primed brush for cleaning which you can toss in the flimsy case. I use Diawa brand fishing reel oil because the tube lasts forever and it is an extremely clean and lightweight oil. I don't think Amazon sells it but if you Google Needle Nose reel oiler, you will find it.Thanks for reading and if you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will answer best as I can.

"Depression afflicts millions directly, and millions more who are relatives or friends of victims. In its graver, clinical manifestation it takes upward of 20% of its victims by way of suicide, and artistic types are particularly vulnerable. In its extreme form, depression is madness. Loss of appetite, libido, ability to focus, and hope. Fear of being alone. An inner observer who watches dispassionately as his companion struggles. Its roll call includes Vincent Van Gogh, Virginia Woolf, Robin Williams, Sylvia Plath, Jack London, Hunter S. Thompson, Vince Foster, Marilyn Monroe, Ernest Hemingway, Abbie Hoffman, George Eastman, Cleopatra, Robin Williams, and others.Part of the reason depression can be difficult to treat is that it often has no single identifiable cause. Genetics, chemical imbalances, and past experience/behavior may all be important. It is hopelessness even more than pain that crushes the soul.' It is nearly incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it in its extreme mode. Claims of an easy way out are glib and most likely fraudulent.One of the many dreadful manifestations of depression is a failure of self-esteem/being taken over by self-loathing - one of its most universally experienced symptoms. It is nearly incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it. Symptoms begin with a sense of dread, alienation, and stifling anxiety. Disruption of normal sleep patterns is another devastating feature of depression. A lot of literature concerning depression is breezily optimistic, spreading assurance that nearly all depressive states will be stabilized or reversed if only the suitable antidepressant can be found.Eventually, the suitable antidepressant is found, and he's released from hospitalization. Before getting there, however, readers encounter some incredible thoughts:The word 'depression' is inadequate, a 'wimp of a word for an illness that is a 'howling tempest in the brain.' The suffering is 'beyond expression.' As for the value of psychotherapy for one with advance depression - 'virtually nil,' while group therapy is 'hateful,' and art therapy 'organized infantilism.' He fears his accounting of schemes to kill himself will seem 'especially repugnant to healthy Americans, with their faith in self-improvement.' Despite the anguish devouring one's brain, the sufferer must present a face approximating the one associated with ordinary events, try to utter small talk, be responsive to questions, and knowingly nod and frown, even smile. 'But it is a fierce trial attempting to speak a few simple words.'His most encouraging thought - that 'for me the real healers were seclusion and time.'","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ATOMOT4ZKV0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S2W3LU#wasThisHelpful","R3ATOMOT4ZKV0W","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bolger's summary begins by wandering around the Mid-East, going back to Iraq War I - including going inside some of the military minds of the time. Intelligence has been 'trained' to report what the enemy 'could do,' not speculate on what it 'would do.' (Prior errors include believing in 1941 that the Japanese could not fly hundreds of miles from their carriers - they had poor night vision from too much rice in their diet, that peasant North Koreans could not be tough, that the Chinese could never cross the Yalu River undetected, that the North Vietnamese would fold under U.S. bombing, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991). Yet, there were still major questions - would the Republican Guards stand their ground?  How competent was the Iraqi Air Force? (Flew only 910 sorties, vs. over 60,000 by the Coalition, lost every air-to-air encounter, and lost 132 planes to pilot desertion to unfriendly IranWhat about the Arab penchant for raids and ambushes, disdain for stand-and-fight tactics - as reported by Lawrence of Arabia in WWI? (Fortunately, Saddam chose to make war the Western way.)Conservative estimates of Iraqi casualties ran about 20,000 dead and up to 75,000 wounded, 86,743 prisoners, 148 Americans killed, 458 wounded, and 21 captured, and thousands of tanks, artillery, APCs, and trucks destroyed. At the 3/3/90 cease-fire discussion, the Iraqis innocently raised a seemingly minor issue - later found to bring major repercussions. 'We would like to agree that helicopter flights sometimes are needed to carry officials from one place to the other because the roads and bridges are out (U.S. bombing).' It was all they asked for, and given that, they hoped for a bit of magnanimity from Schwarzkopf. And he walked right into it. 'So you mean even armed helicopters can fly in Iraqi skies?'  'You have my word,' was the response.February 15, 1991. President Bush asked the Iraqi people and military to overthrow Saddam. AK-47s and hand grenades were little help against tanks, heavy artillery, and helicopters. It took until summer of 1992 to extend a Kurdish-type no-fly zone over the Shiite south - by then, the aircraft flew cover mostly for some 10,000 gravesites. The Iraqi Shiites found the U.S. unreliable, a view encouraged by their friends in Iran. And remaining American generals learned that a large portion of Saddam's Republican Guards had escaped Desert Storm. As for a peacekeeping mission, the U.S. wanted none of it.Saddam chose to define his regime's continued existence as a victory over the vast American-led Coalition. (Bush lost his job in the '92 election.) The Arab street bought it, especially after the Kurds were boxed in, the Shiites blasted, and Saddam rearmed. On the other hand, a huge number of infidels were now polluting the holy land of the Prophet Muhammad, and bin Laden didn't like it.The guided-missile destroyer U.S.S. Cole sailed into Aden in October, 2000 to pick up 220k gallons of diesel - while also reinforcing America's support for Yemen's president. Two small boats arranged to pick up the Cole's trash for $150, then a third dingy approached, and both of its locals waved as it touched the Cole's flank.  The 500-lb. bomb opened a hole 40' across., with a third of the damage extending below the waterline.Back in Afghanistan, bin Laden received a revelation he attributed to Allah. The communist Russian superpower had failed, pulled out, and then imploded - all thanks to holy warriors in Afghanistan. If al-Qaeda could lure the U.S. to the same killing ground, that might well crippled it and run them out of the entire region. Previously he'd launched truck-bomb explosions at U.S. embassies in Kenya and in Tanzania on 8/7/1999, then the Cole bombing. Still, bin Laden did not achieve his desired result.And on it goes, years more of bloody detail.What have we gotten out of 14 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq? At this point it's pretty clear - mostly huge negatives. The loss of thousands of Americans and trillions of dollars, as well as a huge hit to our perceived 'soft' and 'hard' power. Iraq - obviously we should have never invaded post 9/11, and also committed major errors there at the end of Iraq War I (allowing armed helicopter flights, encouraging Iraqis to revolt - only to be mowed down by Saddam's remaining forces), and now have spawned a new terrorist group - ISIS. There was plausible rationale for invading Afghanistan, but we allowed our initial success to wither away due to becoming distracted by Iraq. We neglected to build a strong Afghan army - only 36,000 trained by 2006, five years after we arrived.Bolger's suggestion, however, that we should have invaded Iraq and then left, is untenable. Obviously Sunni and Shia problems would have torn the country apart - as it almost did anyway. In Afghanistan, it simply would have accelerated the return of the Taliban, post our initial victories. More importantly - we simply should never have invaded Iraq to start with. (Invading Afghanistan was politically inevitable, though at best would have served little purpose beyond simply bombing bin Laden's camps.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EPO7EPCT1M3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544570413#wasThisHelpful","R1EPO7EPCT1M3P","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took me several months to figure out that Vietnam was a tragic error - that we'd never win there, and there was no domino danger. I also learned a bigger lesson - that so-called 'experts' aren't always right. In fact, they've been wrong on every single call in the Middle East for at least the last half-century. Bush II's decision/deception to invade Iraq was the latest, and perhaps worst mistake. Attacking Afghanistan seemed to make a lot more sense, and we quickly swept the countryside with a few advisors teaming with the Northern Alliance, along with our Air Force.Or did we? Afghanistan then faded out of the news until about 2008, and we then realized little, if anything, had been accomplished. Fortunately, this book provides important added dimensions and answers. Prior to arriving in Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan in 11/2001, author Gall had met Russian veterans of their Afghanistan conflict, as well as listened to stories from her then journalist father who had covered the conflict. She had also traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan - seeing Wahhabis, North Africans, and others - then looking for a new cause. Author Gall has been a reporter for the New York Times for much of this - and a more qualified source would be hard to imagine.Afghanistan became America's longest war - fourteen years later, there still is no immediately resolution in sight - despite the Afghans having never been advocates of terrorism. The Taliban have since resurged. The 'real' enemy, however, is and always was Pakistan. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to learn of Pakistan's involvement - thanks to sometimes brutal manipulation of the media to hide the truth from its own people. Galls story begins with a Northern Afghanistan Taliban surrender, November 2001. Their leader had commanded over 10,000 Taliban along with hundreds more al Qaeda and other foreign fighters. There were also hundreds of Pakistanis - advisors, trainers, illiterate villagers and religious students, and intelligence experts. About 2,000 Pakistani had been evacuated on secret flights from a nearby airfield. The Pakistanis were retired officers on contract, civilians, and only occasionally active soldiers, never in uniform. Some had been trained by the U.S. Army. Pakistan's objective - protecting its western flank; Islamists were favored as allies because they could be counted on to resist non-Muslim foes such as the Soviet Union and India, and ethnic Islamist Pashtuns in Afghanistan. (Pakistan was also concerned with controlling Pashtun nationalism - some wanted their own state.) Osama bin Laden later became a leading influence.The Taliban had been formed seven years prior with the intent of gaining control and establishing a fundamentalist Islamic regime. They enforced a strict, fundamentalist code of behavior harking back to Mohammad's time - banning music, television, and almost all recreation, required males to attend prayers 5X/day and grow their  beards long. Their contribution to society was bringing order to an often lawless countryside. By 2001 they'd come close to their overall goal. Then came 9/11. U.S. missiles demolished Taliban positions and camps, followed by Afghans on horseback seizing the territory and finishing off stragglers. Even in cities, missiles found the Taliban, guided by Afghan informers working undercover with GPS locators and satellite phones. A number of the foreign fighters resisted being taken prisoner (some feared repatriation, others were religious zealots), and both sides suffered casualties. The prisoners were among the first transferred to the Guantanamo prison in Cuba. Others, sent elsewhere by General Dostum's men, were treated warily at best - many locked in airtight shipping containers died from asphyxiation en route.The Taliban had misjudged the strength of the American attack, been greatly overextended in northern Afghanistan, and misread the strength of their standing with the Afghan population via co-opting regional and religious figures. In southern Afghanistan, American precision-bombing - guided by American special forces, also quickly decimated local Taliban. Tribal elders and opposition groups rushed forward to join the winning side. Mullah Omar, however, continued to refuse to give up bin Laden to the U.S. The other Taliban leaders surrendered, Karzai did not accept Omar's and he was allowed to escape.Years later, as the Taliban resurgence grew, critics questioned why there had not been a greater effort to find a more inclusive settlement and even a power-sharing agreement that could have prevented a return of hostilities. Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi, head of the U.N. mission in 2001 said the American and Afghan opposition would not have allowed such.A strictly honored custom is that no one enters an Afghan's home without being invited, and no man unrelated to the family enters the women's quarters. Thus, the readiness of foreign soldiers to violate this by kicking down doors in house-to-house raids and searching women's quarters became one of the most upsetting issues for Afghans. (Conversely, when you are invited into someone's home, you are under the protection of your host. Thus, the author had no fear going to interview a Taliban commander in a back street.)Taliban did not trust Karzai's promise that they could return to their homes and live in peace because they had lost the support of the people and expected retribution from opponents and arrest or worse from Americans. They were also distrustful of the Pakistanis because President Musharraf was cooperating with the U.S. - nonetheless, large numbers filtered into Pakistan. Only a single prominent Taliban official was handed over to the U.S. in the first years after 9/11.Mullah Omar's call to arms 2/03 changed the pace of Taliban activities. Police posts came under frequent attack, fliers announcing jihad and warning against collaborating with Americans and the Karzai started turning up. An alliance took place between the Taliban, al Qaeda, and a mujahideen leader. Taliban members in exile were threatened with force by ISI if they tried to avoid the insurgency, the Taliban foreign minister was jailed by Americans despite offering to cooperate, and the Taliban offered money to its members - $175/month, with bonuses for killing government officials and Americans. (Many had no other way to support their families.)The coalition had 11,500 in its force in mid-2003 (and easily defeated the insurgents then in southern Afghanistan), vs. 140,000 NATO-led and 300,000 Afghan security forces seven years later. Many of Karzai's governors and security officials were inadequate, and in some cases grossly corrupt and predatory --> losing support of large sections of the population. (Local police chiefs tended to use family members as bodyguards; the most effective ones were former mujahideen commanders with loyal networks of fighters and informants.) Governors who tried to manage more honestly were hampered by lack of money, infrastructure, and security - problems ignored by Kabul. One high-level source told Gall that the Taliban were being reorganized by funding from Arab countries and that Mullah Omar and other top commanders were in Pakistan, and protected there by their links to the Pakistani establishment.Then came years of American/NATO bombing of suspected Taliban hideouts, innumerable associated civilian deaths, and creating Afghan hatred of their 'rescuers.' Not until General McChrystal took command in 2009 did U.S. switch to protecting the civilian population. But the damage was done. (Part of the rationale for the air strikes - only having about 35,000 NATO forces in 2008 forced its use.) Reports then came of soldiers killing villagers, instead of bombs. Whenever author Gall and other reporters were able to reach the scene and interview witness, they corroborated the veracity of those claims - contrary to the reports of the soldiers. There were also reports of prisoners being abused/tortured/beaten to death - Gall even saw death certificates issued by American pathologists listing cause of death as 'Murder.' No one was charged. Others were detained for years without trial or contact with family or lawyers, sometimes fingered by malicious or misguided informers.In 2004 the U.N. and U.S.-led coalition initiated a nationwide disarmament program (Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration program) to reduce the power of militia commanders and prevent a repeat of the factional violence of the 1990s. The mujahideen's big guns and old Soviet tanks were put under government control, and the armed militias, estimated at 100,000, were disbanded. Every rural family had had men in the mujahideen, and the Taliban benefitted from their growing disaffection. While it disabled rivals to Karzai, it also removed the strongest anti-Taliban forces from the scene, creating a vacuum of power. There was no Afghan Army in Helmand (southern Afghanistan) at the time, the police consisted of just a few hundred men dispersed over a dozen district town, and the U.S. had only a small presence in Gereshk. Eighteen months later, author Gall learned that the Taliban now held sway and the area was now too dangerous for travel. People then questioned the seriousness of NATO and the government.Karzai was a poor administrator, and didn't work to create pressure to reduce Afghan on Afghan abuses. His staff ignored ordered, and he spent little time praise the troops.Suicide bombing was unknown in 2001 Afghanistan until the assignation of Ahmed Shah Massoud 9/9/01, but became increasingly common by 2006 . Afghan investigators soon discovered that the suicide bombers (mostly Afghans living in Pakistan, or Pakistanis - eg. paid $1,400 to their families, if successful; an Afghan judge was paid $40/month) and their supplies were emanating from Pakistan - especially their madrassas (free room and board, as many as 3,000 students at a site - students could be taught general subject, including math and geography, but were only tested in religious subjects). Pakistani officials repeatedly refused to take action.Bottom-Line: 'The Wrong Enemy' is interesting reading and helps one understand our failure in Afghanistan. While it is clear that Pakistan served as a refuge and training ground for Afghanistan's Taliban, Gall does not make a convincing case that had the U.S. forcefully addressed that problem Afghanistan would have turned out differently. For one thing, U.S. failure to take advantage of its initial Afghanistan successes provided an incredible opportunity for a Taliban resurgence. Another problem - Pakistan has over 100 nuclear weapons, as well as missiles and a rabid Muslim population. Her coverage of the 'Red Mosque' siege and Bhutto assassination, as well as its lawless northern region also suggests potential problems if the U.S. had further angered Pakistan's Muslims by going beyond the use of drones in Pakistan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JCHF36ZA6AL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544046692#wasThisHelpful","R2JCHF36ZA6AL3","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"China holds over $1.4 trillion in U.S. debt, by far our largest foreign debt holder. As of the end of August of 2015, the U.S. trade imbalance with China is already at $237 billion, en route to an annual imbalance of $350+ billion. 'Watching the Obama administration, one might think nothing can be done about protecting American workers and companies.' says Trump. Continuing - 'What China has done to the U.S. may be the greatest theft in the history of the world.'Almost all American politicians tell us how great we are, then switch to how they're going to make America even better - all the while denying even the existence of our major problems and failing to focus on resolving them. The most obvious example - our economy, decimated by millions of illegal immigrants and their progeny, hundreds of thousands of H1-B visas, and shipping millions of jobs to Mexico and Asia.America had a $40.4 billion trade deficit in goods and services (excluding energy) in March, 2014, $121.5 billion for the first quarter of the year. Since 1970, we‚Äôve accumulated an almost $10 trillion trade deficit in goods and services ($9.552 billion) via a negative balance every year except three (1970, 1973, and 1975). Per the Center for American Progress‚Äôs 3/2008 report, that deficit has also extended to high-technology (including aerospace, information and communication technology, opt-electronics, and nuclear technology) since 2002, and includes China, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Not surprisingly, the trade deficit is also widening, from $82.1 billion for the years 1970-79 to $5.5 trillion for 2000-09. ‚ÄòServices‚Äô are the one bright spot, barely ‚Äì steadily increasing to a $229 billion surplus in 2013. The ‚Äòreally bad news,‚Äô however, is that Alan Blinder (former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman, Economics Professor at Princeton) contends that about one-fourth of remaining jobs are vulnerable to offshoring, mostly in the services area.Meanwhile, Wall Street is climbing to new levels as our economy now produces (record) ‚ÄòProfits Without Production‚Äô (Paul Krugman) ‚Äì providing proof that Wall Street and Main Street are no longer closely connected.Many Trump opponents contend that limiting free trade would bring back the Great Depression, citing the fact that after the Smoot-Hawley bill was passed the depression deepened. Data, however, does not support blaming Smoot-Hawley tariffs for worsening economic conditions in the U.S. Three problems severely undermine such a conclusion:1)There already were preexisting high tariffs prior to Smoot-Hawley,2)Smoot-Hawley was passed 8 months after the October 1929 stock market crash, and3)Foreign trade comprised a very small proportion (about 0.5%) of U.S. GDP at the time.Others simply assert that free trade boost U.S. employment, citing Boeing as an example. True, Boeing and a few others have greatly benefitted from free trade, but one should not forget that OVERALL, we‚Äôve imported far more than imported ‚Äì there‚Äôs no way to logically conclude that U.S. employment has benefitted overall from free trade.Some dismiss free trade as a minor issue, preferring to instead focus on federal deficits, especially expenditures for health care and Social Security. Somehow our cumulative $10 trillion trade deficit also becomes invisible to those concerned about federal debts. That logic is obviously faulty ‚Äì there cannot be any doubt that free trade has reduced U.S. employment, wages and benefit levels, as well as tax (eg. income and sales) collections. It also has increased demands for government assistance (unemployment insurance, Food Stamps, Medicaid, retraining and additional education). Treating symptoms (our large and increasing federal deficit), and focusing on symptoms (our large and rising federal instead of causes (free trade) just doesn‚Äôt make sense. Neither does ignoring our large and rising cumulative merchandise trade deficit.Free Trade has also hollowed out much of America‚Äôs manufacturing base ‚Äì driving through Detroit, Akron, Youngtown, Gary and other former industrialized cities reveals innumerable silent smokestacks, empty parking lots, and broken windows in our former factories. We‚Äôve also gone from being the ‚Äòarsenal of democracy‚Äô to relying on Russian rockets used to launch half of U.S. military and national intelligence satellites.Estimating the employment losses due to free trade requires first obtaining a figure for hourly total compensation costs. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that would be $35.53 for the U.S. in 2011. (Also notable and important ‚Äì Japan ($35.71), Germany ($47,38), Switzerland ($60.40) and others have higher costs AND a positive merchandise trade balance.) Converting the $35.53 to an annual cost (about $74,000), and dividing that figure into the average annual trade deficit for the last five years (about $500 billion) creates an estimate of 6.7 million potential job gains from eliminating our merchandise trade deficit.Other important benefits would also result from eliminating our merchandise trade deficit ‚Äì reduced demand for government services, improved psychological and physical health for the long-term unemployed, increased sales and income tax collections, higher wages and benefits for many of those still employed, and improved U.S. ability (via co-location) to conduct R&D linked to refinements of existing products and production processes.The losers from doing such ‚Äì profits at large corporations and Wall Street, and the wealth and incomes of the 1%.What‚Äôs the easiest way to eliminate these deficits ‚Äì direct government action. We also need to examine how Japan, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and others have managed to avoid this problem, despite even higher labor costs, as well as determine how to prevent the problem from undermining our service sector in the near future.Another major problem for our economy - the estimated 12 million illegals and their progeny, taking jobs from Americans and lowering wages for millions more.Candidate Trump also opposes the 5,544-page Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal, calling it 'insanity,' as well as far too long to be understood, and doesn't cover currency manipulation - the number-one weapon within Free Trade used by foreign countries to hurt the U.S. and take away jobs. (China is not part of the TPP deal, but widely expected to join in the next few years.)Trump also calls NAFTA a 'disaster' and vows to renegotiate or break the deal if elected. (I can't wait!)In other areas, Trump would significantly cut the Department of Education's funding, support school choice, defeat ISIS by taking their oil wealthy, and replace ObamaCare.The 'good news' in this sea of red ink? Donald Trump has identified Free Trade and illegal immigration as major sources of our economic doldrums! His election would go a long ways towards fixing our economy. Let's replace 'Free Trade' with 'Fair Trade.'","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N43F68VZW0QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501137964#wasThisHelpful","R2N43F68VZW0QC","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The conditions of people's lives can lead to physical and mental illnesses. Taking control of one's life and exercising, eating, and drinking sensibly, having time off on happy holidays is great if one is well off - financially and socially. Dr. Marmot asks, 'Why (just) treat people and send them back to the conditions that made them sick?' Being emotionally abused by your spouse, having family troubles, being unlucky in love, being marinal in society can all increase risk of disease.Health is correlated with work status. In the Whitehall Study of 17,000 men (1978-84) at the bottom of British civil service found their mortality rate was 4X that of the men at the top; in between health improved steadily with rank. High stress, low control.In 2012, the World Health Organization concluded that life expectancy in the world was 70, ranging from 46 in Sierra Leone to 84 in Japan. Regardless, in Nepal, life expectancy improved by about 20 years between 1980 and 2012, to 69; thus, progress can be rapid. More action is needed. Marmot contends that health inequalities are not a footnote to the health problems we face - they are the major health problem. We have major inequalities in health - both within and between countries.About 13% of American boys aged 15 will not reach their 60th birthday, vs. only 7% in Sweden. If the U.S. has the best health care in the world, why do U.S. young adults have less of a chance for surviving to 60 than those in Costa Rica, Cuba, and Slovenia? Medical care has little to do with it - the differences are attributable mostly to homicide, suicide, car crashes, other accidents, drugs, alcohol, and other disorders. Russia is much worse - one-third of its 15-year-old boys do not make it to age 60 - only marginally better than Sierra Leonne. Twenty years ago, survival chances of 15-year-old Swedes was worse than now, and a lot like that of America's today. The U.S. is richer (national income/capita) than almost all the 49 countries ahead of it in survival. Russia's national income/capita (adjusted for purchasing power) is 20X that for Guinea-Bissau, yet boys in both have the same survival odds.In Sierra Leone, one of every 21 fifteen-year-old girls in school will die during child-bearing years of a cause related to maternity. In Italy, it is one out of 17,100, and one of 1,800 in the U.S. Sixty-two countries have lower lifetime risks of maternal deaths than the U.S.Among poor countries, higher national income is associated with better health (up to about $10,000/capita in purchasing power parity), among 'rich' countries getting richer does very little for health. Other things are more important.Marmot's Three Main Points: 1)There is no good biological reason for most of the health inequalities we see within and between countries. 2)We know what to do to make a difference - rapid change is possible. 3)Health is related to how we organize our affairs. Good early child development, education, good working conditions, a cohesive society are all linked to better health.Most people visiting Calton (near Glascow) would call it poor, yet it is fantastically wealthy vs. India - where one-third of the populace live on $1.25/day. Average income in India, adjusted for purchasing power, is $3,300. Almost everyone in Calton has shelter, a toilet, clean water, and food. Yet, life expectancy for men is 8 years less than the average for India.The 2010 Global Burden of Disease study made estimates of the major causes of ill-health overall. In descending order, they were high-blood pressure, smoking, household air pollution, low fruit intake, high body mass index, high fasting plasma glucose level, childhood underweight, ambient particulate matter pollution, physical inactivity, high sodium intakes, . . .. Sanitation and unimproved water bring up the rear of the list, and childhood underweight comes after high body mass index.Harry Burns compared mortality rates in Glasgow with those in Manchester and Liverpool. Causes of death with the largest relative excess in Glasgow were all psychosocial - drug-related poisonings, deaths associated with alcohol, suicide, accidents, and violence other than suicide.The Top (Typical) Tips For Healthy Living: Don't smoke, Keep physically active. Eat a balanced diet, Drink alcohol, if at all, in moderation. Drive safely. No illegal drugs. Top Tips for Healthy Living Taking Living Conditions Into Account: Don't be poor. Don't live in a deprived area. Don't be disabled or have a disabled child. Don't work in a stressful, low-paid manual job. Don't be a lone parent. Claim all benefits to which you are entitled. Be able to afford a car. Use education to improve your position.We now that tobacco, alcohol, and processed meats are bad for us - yet, the economic interests of those industries, along with cries of 'Nanny-State,' limit the action taken to limit their damage.'The smaller the dress size, the larger the apartment.'

"This movie not only depicts the bravery and sacrifice of WWII airmen, it also shows different management styles in the face of grave danger. Lt. Col. Davenport, loved and respected by his men, lost his effectiveness as a leader when he became so preoccupied with his group's high fatality rate that he no longer could inspire the performance and courage needed to effectively continue the missions. Gen. Savage then takes over command and rebuilt discipline, confidence and courage - though not without first encountering rocky times due to pilot resentment.Discipline first, choosing the right people, training, leading by example, not seeking popularity, and creating a sense of purpose were used by Savage to turn the group from last place performance to first-place. Meanwhile, some of those not normally directly involved in the raids sneak aboard raids to be closer to the effort.Eventually, Gen.

"President Eisenhower used his farewell address to warn of the dangers of the military-industrial complex, seeing its potential to undermine democracy. That warning has not been heeded, and we're now paying the price.Congress is a major part of the problem. Jobs created by defense spending create vested interests in military action. Many Americans do not understand the forces at play, but may be reluctant to question top decision makers for fear they will be seen as unpatriotic. The process began in the late 1940s and expanded dramatically with the Korean War which began in 1950. While that war ended in 1953, defense spending remained at historic levels as fear of communist expansion dominated American politics. Then came the Vietnam War and defense spending soared again in the mid-1960s. Reagan's military buildup in the 1980s brought Cold War spending to a new peak of $552 billion. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought a modest reduction in defense spending.Then came 9/11/01 - predictably, defense spending nearly doubled as we launched two wars and turned out new high-technology weapons living in caves and mud houses. Invading Afghanistan and Iraq killed over 350,000 and added untold numbers of new enemies. Today, we spend about as much on our military as the next nine-countries combined.Why does our military budget today continue at near-record levels (nearly $1 trillion for the Pentagon wars, Homeland Security, nuclear weapons, veterans benefits, etc.), with many calling for major boosts? (If the war costs hit $6 trillion as predicted by Bilmes at Harvard, that would be the equivalent of about $75,000 for every U.S. household.) Why do we act as the world policeman, now expanding our role in Asia even while withdrawing troops in Iraq and Afghanistan? What did the 1991 Gulf War accomplish? Why did we get involved in Libya?As of 2013, DOD employed over 2 million, including 1.4 million uniformed personnel, over 700,000 civilians, and another 1.1 million part-time members of the National Guard and Reserves. The State Department employed about 69,000.Has all this made us safe, or at least safer? It would be difficult to conclude that it has. A Russian airliner was just destroyed mid-air - likely culprit being ISIS, responding to Russia's involvement in Syrian civil war - we could be next, thanks to our far larger involvement in the Middle-East. Our Navy is prodding China over its latest island construction, while we also attempt to reign in Russia's efforts in the Ukraine. And our leadership in delaying Iran's nuclear weapon development certainly didn't win new friends there either.The Pentagon recruited 75 retired military officers during the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, who supposedly worked as independent analysts for U.S. television and radio networks. Revealed by NYT reporter David Barstow, the program gave them special access in exchange for pro-Pentagon commentary. The retired officers were also working collectively for over 150 companies selling to the Pentagon. Their special access to policymakers received by parroting Pentagon talking points also gave them opportunities to pitch their companies' offers of various products and services. Rumsfeld's personal approval was required for each officer in the program.By 2008, DOD had more contractors in Iraq than troops (155,826 vs. 152,275), and in 2013 108000 contract workers in Afghanistan vs. 65,700 troops. Innumerable corruption scandals have been reported involving Pentagon procurement.'Time' magazine reported U.S. military spending was $2,700/capita in 2008 - up from $1,500 in 1998; NATO allies spent only about 4500/capita/year during that period. Jennifer Rizzo (CNN) reported in 2011 that about three million were employed by the defense industry - both directly and indirectly (local businesses supported by a defense contractor's location nearby). The Aerospace Industries Association reported in 2012 that the average salary paid aerospace and defense workers was $80,175, vs. $44,140 for the average American worker.Edward Snowden, former Booz Allen employee, earned $200,000/year. Defense contractors see  cybersecurity as their next cash cow - 70% of national intelligence budgets are spent in the private sector.U.S. arms sales outside the U.S. in 2011 were $44.3 billion and included 173 countries, including Saudi Arabia and Israel.The defense  community donated $27 million to political candidates and committees during the 2012 election cycle.A 1998 GAO reported stated that the Air Force requested 5 C-130s, while Congress funded 256 over a multi-year period. Major system contracts are spread to 40 or more states. Numerous other examples of Congress  buying more than the military wanted.Federal spending on defense creates jobs, but not as many as some other areas. Pollin, of the University of Massachusetts, in a 2011 study found that spending $1 billion created 11,200 military jobs, 16,800 clean-energy jobs, 17,200 health-care jobs, and 26.700 education jobs.Militarism springs from the same psychological deficit that requires an endless series of enemies, both foreign and domestic.America has 1,826 think tanks, per a 2014 University of Pennsylvania report, with over 400 in and around D.C. Many don't 'think, they justify and fight for their ideas.' Conservative think tanks typically are hawks on defense, financed by corporate money - much from defense industries or right-wing billionaires. They hire conservative academic and experts to write papers, letters, and opinion articles advocating robust defense policy, and often also argue for war. The group that built the rationale for the Iraq War (Project for the New American Century - PNAC) was part of one of the largest conservative think tanks - AEI. Since the 1980s, the Koch brothers have provided over $30 million to George Mason University for 'market-oriented ideas.' When talk shows and PBS want 'experts' on foreign policy, they often turn to think tanks.Rob Stein estimates that from 2003 to 2005, conservative organizations spent about $295 million to influence policy, vs. $75 million on the left. The libertarian Cato Institute traditionally opposes foreign intervention.Secretary of State Colin Powell, in an hour-long U.N. speech 2/5/03 made at least 18 false statement while selling Congress, the media, and most Americans on the need for war with Iraq. The information came from the CIA, which previously vastly and repeatedly had overestimated Soviet strength - also for political purposes. It was not alone - a National Security Council study in 1950 (NSC-68) did the same, becoming the foundation of our foreign policy for over two decades. Senators Symington and Kennedy helped lead public campaigns against Eisenhower for his supposedly tolerating a 'missile gap.' Data later revealed that the U.S. actually had a 17:1 advantage - this was exposed by Secretary McNamara. Embarrassed by being forced out of Cuba, the Soviets then caught up via a massive missile program.The Vietnam War was motivated by fear of Communism. In 1976, hawks on Ford's Presidential Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board pushed 'competitive analysis' of the Soviet threat. A group of CIA analysis ('Team A') was pitted against outsiders ('Team B') in evaluating the same classified intelligence. George H.W. Bush, Ford's newly appointed CIA director agreed to this, just months after predecessor, William Colby, had rejected the idea; reportedly, Donald Rumsfeld lobbied for Colby's replacement. Team B was backed by politically conservative politicians opposing d√©tente and coexistence - eg. Richard Pipes, Paul Wolfowitz, Paul Nitze, Norman Podhertz, and Dick Cheney.Republicans in Congress, angered by a 1995 CIA report on missile threats to the U.S. established an alternative commission, chaired by Rumsfeld which then issued a more threatening forecast. Previously the CIA had also systematically overstated the Soviet threat during the Cold War, therefore 'justifying' expansion of U.S. bases, ships, missiles, and bombers. It then failed to foresee the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the 2011 Arab awakening.The U.S. has 17 intelligence agencies. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied to Congress - stating the NSA did not 'wittingly' collect information on Americans; Snowden revealed the NSA collected millions of Americans' phone and e-mail communications; Clapper then apologized.'Once upon a time you could trace the spread of imperialism by counting up colonies. America's version of the colony is the military base.' Chalmers Johnson.Since WWII, the U.S. has taken military action an estimated 125 times. The 1973 War Powers Resolution allows the president to deploy limited numbers of troops without prior congressional approval (Bush II got a congressional resolution supporting the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but no declaration of war.) The War Powers Resolution allows Congress to avoid controversy and just vote after the fact to 'support the troops.'  Since WWII we've had the Korean, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq (2) Wars, sponsored/supported coups in Iran, Guatemala, Cuba, Chile, and Panama, occupied Grenada, Somalia, Haiti, Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, and Lebanon, bombed Laos, Cambodia, Libya, Serbia, Pakistan, and supported existing governments in Afghanistan and El Salvador.  Our total spending for national security was about $1 trillion in F.Y. 2012, including Homeland Security.Dana Priest, Washington Post, 7/2013: 'The government has built a security and intelligence system so big, so complex, and so hard to manage, no one really knows if it's fulfilling its most important purpose - Keeping its citizens safe.' Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies are working on programs related to counterterrorism, Homeland Security, and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the U.S. Many do the same work - eg. there are 51 federal organizations and military commands, operating in 15 U.S. cities, to track the flow of money to/from terrorist networks. We publish 50,000 intelligence reports/year - many are simply ignored.With defense spending, the only lobby is the one in favor. Anyone speaking against defense spending risks being labeled weak on defense.President Carter's 'Carter Doctrine' 1/23/80: The U.S. holds 'vital interests' in the Persian Gulf and would use 'any means necessary, including military force, to bar any nation's attempt to dominate that region.' The other engine of our policy in the area - support for Israel; the two often conflict.Candidate Reagan derided Carter's appeal to conserve energy and accused him of failing to build/use American power abroad, helping him win the election. Soviet involvement in Afghanistan was seen as a threat to America's Persian Gulf interests, thus motivating our support for Afghanistan from Carter.A 2010 study by Princeton University's Roger Stern concluded the U.S. had spent $7.3 trillion from 1976 to 2007 to keep at least one aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf to make it safe for oil shipments. Our invasion of Iraq added another $3 trillion in spending by 2008.Cato Institute's Benjamin Friedman - Most of our military spending goes to conventional forces adept at destroying well-armed enemies. Terrorists are lightly armed and mostly hidden. Counter insurgency enthusiasts claim we can be safe from terrorists only by using ground forces to rebuild the states where they operate. But we have learned the hard way that theory badly over-estimates our ability to organize other nations' politics.'McCartney also notes that some of our top leaders have an oil industry background: Bush I (Zapata Petroleum), Dick Cheney (Haliburton), George Schultz (Bechtel - operates oil refineries), Condoleeza Rice (Chevron board member).Reagan and Gorbachev's dream of eliminating nuclear weapons was killed when Richard Perle, neoconservative hawk and longtime opponent of arms control, told him the U.S. could not carry on SDI research in a laboratory as the Russians proposed (George Shultz, Paul Nitze, Robert McNamara, Madeline Albright, James Baker, Colin Powell, Melvin Laird, Melvin Laird, and Zbigniew Brezinski supported the Russian proposal.) Edward Teller supported the original proposal. We've pumped over $200 billion into Star Wars - even under favorable conditions, it has only been successful in half of 16 intercept tests. Regardless, a nuclear bomb could be delivered in a shipping container - a 'gun assembly' bomb would use 55 - 110 lbs of highly enriched uranium; we have 7,700 nuclear weapons, and spend about $30 billion/year keeping them ready.North Korea has 8 - 10 nuclear weapons, Pakistan 120.New 'Virginia-class' nuclear-powered attack submarines cost $3 billion (eg. USS Texas), take about five years to build; 30 are planned, they have suppliers in 47 states. The Navy also plans for a new class (SSBN-X), 12 at $7 - $8 billion each. We have 11 large nuclear carriers; the displacement of the U.S. battle fleet is greater than that of the next 13 largest navies - 11 of which are allies.China now fills the role as America's enemy. The Gulf of Tonkin incident (August, 1964) brought an escalating war in Vietnam, false.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39KJRIRN0W9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250069777#wasThisHelpful","R39KJRIRN0W9P","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The conditions of people's lives can lead to physical and mental illnesses. Taking control of one's life and exercising, eating, and drinking sensibly, having time off on happy holidays is great if one is well off - financially and socially. Dr. Marmot asks, 'Why (just) treat people and send them back to the conditions that made them sick?' Being emotionally abused by your spouse, having family troubles, being unlucky in love, being marinal in society can all increase risk of disease.Health is correlated with work status. In the Whitehall Study of 17,000 men (1978-84) at the bottom of British civil service found their mortality rate was 4X that of the men at the top; in between health improved steadily with rank. High stress, low control.In 2012, the World Health Organization concluded that life expectancy in the world was 70, ranging from 46 in Sierra Leone to 84 in Japan. Regardless, in Nepal, life expectancy improved by about 20 years between 1980 and 2012, to 69; thus, progress can be rapid. More action is needed. Marmot contends that health inequalities are not a footnote to the health problems we face - they are the major health problem. We have major inequalities in health - both within and between countries.About 13% of American boys aged 15 will not reach their 60th birthday, vs. only 7% in Sweden. If the U.S. has the best health care in the world, why do U.S. young adults have less of a chance for surviving to 60 than those in Costa Rica, Cuba, and Slovenia? Medical care has little to do with it - the differences are attributable mostly to homicide, suicide, car crashes, other accidents, drugs, alcohol, and other disorders. Russia is much worse - one-third of its 15-year-old boys do not make it to age 60 - only marginally better than Sierra Leonne. Twenty years ago, survival chances of 15-year-old Swedes was worse than now, and a lot like that of America's today. The U.S. is richer (national income/capita) than almost all the 49 countries ahead of it in survival. Russia's national income/capita (adjusted for purchasing power) is 20X that for Guinea-Bissau, yet boys in both have the same survival odds.In Sierra Leone, one of every 21 fifteen-year-old girls in school will die during child-bearing years of a cause related to maternity. In Italy, it is one out of 17,100, and one of 1,800 in the U.S. Sixty-two countries have lower lifetime risks of maternal deaths than the U.S.Among poor countries, higher national income is associated with better health (up to about $10,000/capita in purchasing power parity), among 'rich' countries getting richer does very little for health. Other things are more important.Marmot's Three Main Points: 1)There is no good biological reason for most of the health inequalities we see within and between countries. 2)We know what to do to make a difference - rapid change is possible. 3)Health is related to how we organize our affairs. Good early child development, education, good working conditions, a cohesive society are all linked to better health.Most people visiting Calton (near Glascow) would call it poor, yet it is fantastically wealthy vs. India - where one-third of the populace live on $1.25/day. Average income in India, adjusted for purchasing power, is $3,300. Almost everyone in Calton has shelter, a toilet, clean water, and food. Yet, life expectancy for men is 8 years less than the average for India.The 2010 Global Burden of Disease study made estimates of the major causes of ill-health overall. In descending order, they were high-blood pressure, smoking, household air pollution, low fruit intake, high body mass index, high fasting plasma glucose level, childhood underweight, ambient particulate matter pollution, physical inactivity, high sodium intakes, . . .. Sanitation and unimproved water bring up the rear of the list, and childhood underweight comes after high body mass index.Harry Burns compared mortality rates in Glasgow with those in Manchester and Liverpool. Causes of death with the largest relative excess in Glasgow were all psychosocial - drug-related poisonings, deaths associated with alcohol, suicide, accidents, and violence other than suicide.The Top (Typical) Tips For Healthy Living: Don't smoke, Keep physically active. Eat a balanced diet, Drink alcohol, if at all, in moderation. Drive safely. No illegal drugs. Top Tips for Healthy Living Taking Living Conditions Into Account: Don't be poor. Don't live in a deprived area. Don't be disabled or have a disabled child. Don't work in a stressful, low-paid manual job. Don't be a lone parent. Claim all benefits to which you are entitled. Be able to afford a car. Use education to improve your position.We now that tobacco, alcohol, and processed meats are bad for us - yet, the economic interests of those industries, along with cries of 'Nanny-State,' limit the action taken to limit their damage.'The smaller the dress size, the larger the apartment.'

"The big problem with the downward spiral of depression is that it doesn't just get your down, it keeps you down. Nothing seems interesting, you feel guilty and anxious. Exercise, sunlight, specific sleep patterns certain muscle movements alter activity in specific circuits, reversing its course. The serotonin system is all the neurons that release or react to serotonin (improves willpower, motivation, and mood), another for norepinephrine (enhances thinking, focus, and dealing with stress), dopamine (increases enjoyment and is necessary for  changing bad habits, oxytocin (promotes feelings of trust, love and connection, and reduces anxiety), GABA (increases feelings of relaxation and reduces anxiety), melatonin (enhances the quality of sleep), endorphins (provide pain relief and feelings of elation), and endocannabinoids (improve your appetite and increase feelings of peacefulness and well-being).Bright sunlight helps boost production of serotonin and improves the release of melatonin.Pretty much the whole highly evolved prefrontal cortex is affected by depression. The limbic system is much older and deeper in the brain, and responsible for emotions like excitement, fear, anxiety, memory, and desire. Also managed here are what you focus on, and long-term memories.Depression is often accompanied by bad habits such as impulsiveness, poor coping skills, addiction, and procrastination.Overall, not that worthwhile - superficial, and greatly downplays the difficulty of escaping depression's downward spiral, per my own experience, as well as that of my son and cousin. Also per Dr. Michael Marmot, President of the World Health Association - living and relationship conditions are major factors and not easy to change.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28IHQ5I1UNN6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626251207#wasThisHelpful","R28IHQ5I1UNN6S","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our brains are built of cells called neurons and glia - hundreds of billions of them. Each cell sends electrical pulses to other cells, up to hundreds of times/second. A typical neuron makes about 10,000 connections to neighboring neurons. There are as many connections in a single cubic centimeter of brain tissue as stars in the Milky Way galaxy.Key Point: Most of what we do and think and fell is not under our  conscious control. Evidence of this - when your foot gets halfway to the brake before you consciously realize a car is backing out of a driveway ahead, or when you notice your name spoken in a conversation across the room you thought you weren't listening to.About one-third of the human brain is devoted to vision.Many of us like to believe that all adults possess the same capacity to make sound choices. It's a nice idea, but wrong. Genetics, environment, chemical and behavioral pathogens, head injury can all influence intelligence, aggression, and decision-making abilities. If you are a male, your probability of committing a violent crime goes up 882%. Of those on Death Row, 98.4% carry those genes, as do the overwhelming majority of prisoners.We cannot presume that everyone has the same drives and behaviors. Who we are runs well below the surface of our conscious access, and the details run back to before our birth.Sophisticated action can result in the absence of free will - Tourette's syndrome can create bursting out with socially unacceptable words/phrases.The main difference between teenage and adult brains is the development of the frontal lobes. Becoming socialized is nothing but developing circuitry to squelch our basest impulses (eg. urinate in public, shoplift).All known serial murderers were abused as children.Neurotransmitters and hormones (chemicals), circuitry - eg. epilepsy focused in one's temporal lobe can create an obsession with religion and a feeling of religious certainty and a false sense of an external presence and often hearing voices attributed to a god (eg. Joan of Arc); viruses and bacteria (eg. rabies) gene mutations (Huntington's) and various combinations can also create behavioral impacts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R55OONJVCXKEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307389928#wasThisHelpful","R55OONJVCXKEW","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Depression afflicts millions directly, and millions more who are relatives or friends of victims. In its graver, clinical manifestation it takes upward of 20% of its victims by way of suicide, and artistic types are particularly vulnerable. Loss of appetite, libido, ability to focus, and hope. Fear of being alone. An inner observer who watches dispassionately as his companion struggles. Its roll call includes Vincent Van Gogh, Virginia Woolf, Robin Williams, Sylvia Plath, Jack London, Hunter S. Thompson, Marilyn Monroe, Ernest Hemingway, Abbie Hoffman, George Eastman, Cleopatra, and others.Part of the reason depression can be difficult to treat is that it often has no single identifiable cause. Genetics, chemical imbalances, and past experience/behavior may all be important. It is hopelessness even more than pain that crushes the soul.'One of the many dreadful manifestations of depression is a failure of self-esteem/being taken over by self-loathing - one of its most universally experienced symptoms. It is nearly incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it. Symptoms begin with a sense of dread, alienation, and stifling anxiety. Disruption of normal sleep patterns is another devastating feature of depression. A lot of literature concerning depression is breezily optimistic, spreading assurance that nearly all depressive states will be stabilized or reversed if only the suitable antidepressant can be found.Eventually, the suitable antidepressant is found, and he's released from hospitalization. Before getting there, however, readers encounter some incredible thoughts:The word 'depression' is inadequate, a 'wimp of a word for an illness that is a 'howling tempest in the brain.' The suffering is 'beyond expression.' As for the value of psychotherapy for one with advance depression - 'virtually nil,' while group therapy is 'hateful,' and art therapy 'organized infantilism.' He fears his accounting of schemes to kill himself will seem 'especially repugnant to healthy Americans, with their faith in self-improvement.' Despite the anguish devouring one's brain, the sufferer must present a face approximating the one associated with ordinary events, try to utter small talk, be responsive to questions, and knowingly nod and frown, even smile. 'But it is a fierce trial attempting to speak a few simple words.'His most encouraging thought - that 'for me the real healers were seclusion and time.'","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQNQOW9Y405L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679736395#wasThisHelpful","R2RQNQOW9Y405L","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book reports how/why doctors continue to used medical practices, sometimes for decades, that are later shown to be of no benefit to their patients. Time and again, we 'learn' that a new practice will help extend life, then that it does not. (Estrogen-replacement therapy after menopause, placement of coronary stents to open narrowed/blocked coronary arteries, cupping  - topical suction, lobotomy. Vioxx, flecainide, losartan, routine mammography for women in their 40s) The authors assert that while there are instances of good hypotheses failing to live up to expectations - such should happen in a lab/controlled clinical trial - not in clinical medicine. They believe medicine can do a better job recommending practices that actually work.Medical reversal/disbelief is strongest when involving how people feel - eg. vertebroplasty, coronary stents (for the first three years), arthroscopic knee surgery to repair degenerative meniscal tears (700K/year),Seven states in the career of a medical innovation,' pre-Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), per John McKinlay: A 'promising report' in which a medical innovation is publicized based on its promise. 2)The innovation is adopted. 3)Patients and payers accept the innovation as standard. 4)Data begin to become available - however, those supporting the innovation come only from insubstantial studies that support the innovation in the most superficial way. 5)The RCT makes an appearance. 6)Then denial, if its use is not supported - entrenched interests deny the innovation may not be effective. 7)Acceptance.While EBM has filled journals, they often avoid big questions or favor one side such that they are not useful.Surrogate end points are objective ones that can be easily and directly measured (eg. improved bone density vs. fracture rates, lowered blood pressure vs. decreased rate of strokes, antiarrhythmic drugs decreasing the number of premature ventricular contractions but not survival after a heart attack, hospitalization rates). However, they are invisible to the patient.Summarizing to this point, we have seen reversal for practices meant to make us live longer when evidence supporting that practice was weak or flawed - this included times when the evidence relied on surrogate end points. For practices meant to make us feel better, we have also learned how powerful the placebo effect is, and noted reversals when treatments were later tested using appropriate controls, such as sham procedures.Screening recommendations have also be reversed. In many reversals involving screening are the worst kind - they are performed on healthy people and thus affect an enormous number of them who simply want to stay that way. An ineffective screening test can turn millions of healthy people into patients. Recommendations for PSA tests, mammograms for women in their forties, Pap smears, etc. have all been revised.In studies of CT-scan screening for lung cancer in those between ages 55 and 80 with a heavy-smoking history is the only screening test to-date that makes you live longer - and even here am many as 96% of abnormal findings are false alarms. In studies of colorectal cancer with 30 years of follow-up, for every 10,000 people, 192 die of colon cancer in the unscreened arm, vs. 128 in the screened arm. However, looking at overall mortality, 7,109 out of 10,000 die in the unscreened group vs. 7,111 in the screened group - not a significant difference.Most experts agree that all cancer screening leads to some amount of over-diagnosis. When we screen for prostate cancer, we end up treating about 40 cancers for every cancer that will kill. For mammography, the best studies suggest that if a mammogram finds breast cancer and it is treated, there is a 13% chance this will have saved a life.Each year in America, we spend hundreds of billions on screening tests and their downstream costs. In 2011, two articles were published, finding that gown-and-glove precautions did not decrease transmission of VRE or MRSA in ICUs - an intervention generating additional costs w/o benefits. However, gown-and-glove precautions were adopted largely on the basis of 'single-center, before-and-after studies. The proof from such a study tends to be tenuous because that center may be idiosyncratic - a unique demographic of patients or bacteria, or an unusually enthusiastic proponent who changes the culture in ways not reproduced elsewhere. Before-and-after studies are also problematic, and the initial data behind most systems interventions. However, one's intervention is never the only thing changed (Hawthorne effects) - and per the author, we have yet to see a very large, well-done randomized trial confirming that eg. a checklist is truly what makes the differences. Another - rapid-response-teams for cardiac arrests were demonstrated in the 2005 MERIT trial in 23 Australian hospitals to not improve patient outcomes. Yet, gown-and-glove precautions and RRT are widely accepted, despite not working.'Door-to-balloon' time was considered an important objective. A 2013 study found that between 2005 and 2009, door-to-ballon times were significantly reduced across the nation - the number of patients waiting longer than 90 minutes decreased from 40.3% to 16.9^. Mortality, however, was unchanged. Explanations - perhaps we were not targeting the right metric (instead focus on total time), or decreasing door-to-balloon time might be an example of diminishing returns. A final example - in 2001 a single-center unblinded RCT found that lowering blood-sugar levels to normal levels could improve survival in a SICU. (A novel strategy because one of the body's responses to critical illness is to raise blood-sugar levels.) This quickly became a new standard until a 2009 multicenter (42 hospitals) RCT found the practice increased deaths by 2.6 percentage points at 90 days.Prasad then points out that while doctors often recommend treatments that do not work, patients also do - on their own. Glucosamine and chondroitin ($700 million in 2004) - a 2006 RCT found no difference in pain; this was followed by a 2010 review of data from 10 different trials that reached the same conclusion. Echinacea - nearly 20% of Americans reported using Echinacea in the past 30 days, mostly to reduce the duration of cold symptoms. A 2005 RCT study concluded it did not reduce symptom duration; this was later supported by 7 randomized trials - only one of which reduced symptom duration compared to a placebo. (The authors also examined 12 studies that looked at Echinacea to prevent colds - none of the studies showed an effect.)Acupuncture is a popular treatment for pain, dating back over 3,000 years. An effort to summarize all research analyzing acupuncture published (Western Chinese, and Korean scientific literature) between 2000 - 2009 concluded there is 'little truly convincing evidence that acupuncture is effective in reducing pain,' and also enumerated a few examples of acupuncture causing real harm.Use of multivitamins in a 2009 study of 161K women found no link to declines in cancer, heart disease, or mortality; a 2013 review of randomized trails found no clear benefit on overall survival, heart disease, or cancer.Recent analyses of randomized trials found that calcium and vitamin D supplementation does not reduce risk of fractures among healthy women, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against the supplements. On the other hand, we've known that calcium and vitamin D supplementation increases kidney stones, and a 2010 group of researchers added heart attacks as another potential side effect.When it comes to dietary habits, studies are less like science and more like an opinion poll. Most diets are never tested in a randomized trial, and when they are, the main outcome of study is usually short-term weight loss. In PREDIMED (an RCT evaluation of the Mediterranean diet, using randomly assigned patients at high risk for a cardiovascular event) found one had to treat about 90 people with the diet for 5 years to prevent one stroke - yet no mortality differences.In 2005 John Ioannidis wanted to measure the proportion of important findings in medicine that were later contradicted. He started with studies referenced over 1,000 times published during the years 1990 to 2003. Of those, 45 found a medical intervention effective, and of those 16% were later found ineffective, another 16% less effective than initially believed, 44% supported in future studies, 24% never tested again. The authors did their own research, using articles in the 2009 NEJM - of the 35 studies examining current standards of care, 46% showed current standards as ineffective. They then extended their study to NEJM articles between 2001 and 2010. Reversals were found in 40%, 38% reaffirmed the benefit of a new practice, and 22% were inconclusive. A project of the British Medical Journal Clinical Evidence completed a review of 3,000 medical practices and found 35% effective, 15% harmful/unlikely to be beneficial/tradeoff, and 50% of unknown effectiveness.Tracking citations to three major practices found not to work: beta-carotene to prevent cancer, estrogen to prevent Alzheimer's, and vitamin E to lower cardiovascular risk, researchers found that 10 years passed before the research community stopped referencing the flawed practice.Original analyses of prescribing estrogens for post-menopausal women was cofounded by the self-selected nature of those originally taking the supplements - less likely to have a family history of heart disease, be hypertensive, have diabetes, or smoke; they also were younger, drank more alcohol, and consumed more saturated fats.A 2012 paper titled 'Empirical Evaluation of Very Large Treatment Effects of Medical Interventions' (Pereira, Horwitz, Ioannidis) examined the proportion of medical trials showing a very large treatment effect (eg. 5X or more). They looked at over 228,000 trials and found only 9% did so. Topics with large effects were less likely to be about mortality and more likely to be about a laboratory value. They then looked at other studies addressing the same questions as those demonstrating the very large treatment effect - 90% of the time, the large treatment effects got smaller when one looked at other studies, thus strongly suggesting the largest magnitude of effect ae more likely statistical flukes.  Across all the studies, only one had a large effect on mortality - a method for oxygenating blood of newborns who cannot adequately breathe on their own.RCTs have intrinsic error rates, added to by early termination of RCTs, publication bias,Industry-sponsored studies are 4X as likely to reach a positive conclusion; they are also less likely to be published/presented, or published after a delay. When companies hold back evidence (device-makers, drug formulators), the medical literature becomes selectively drawn from a much larger pool. Tamiflu was thought to prevent transmission of the flue, decrease hospitalizations, and save lives - an RCT found it decreased flu symptoms by less than a day - while causing nausea and vomiting, did nothing to prevent transmission of the virus, reduce hospitalization or deaths. Previously, Roche (Tamiflu manufacturer) had published its own meta-analysis, and found large benefits. Their study included only those proven to have influenza (rather than those with influenza-like illness) and focused on those receiving the drug early - different than typical use.The FDA cannot consider cost as part of its deliberations, nor relative efficacy. Then, in the early 1990s, the FDA pioneered an accelerated-approval program - allowing drugs for serious diseases with few treatment options to gain approval by showing benefit on a surrogate end point reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The drug is then given a period of time to prove it benefits a more important end point. However, after a drug is approved, it is much harder to get participants to enroll in a study (no one will pay for a trial if there is no prospect for large returns) and after 20 years one-third of these post-approval confirmatory studies had not been completed.What is also not acceptable is for a drug company to develop a drug for one indication and then market it for something else - gabapentin is an egregious, but not the most recent, example. In 1993, under the trade name Neurontin, it was approved to be used for the treatment of seizures when combined with other drugs. Its maker, Parke-Davis, then marketed it for eg. bipolar disorder, pain disorders, etc. AND as a single agent for seizures -  despite having previously being rejected for the latter by the FDA. A $430 million settlement followed, but over 20 years later gabapentin is still not approved for most of the off-label uses for which it was initially promoted. (Another reversal-prone situation.)A bias to 'act now, data later' also contributes to reversal, rapid reporting on new technology is another, along with direct-to-consumer advertising (we're one of only two nations {New Zealand} that permit such). An evaluation of DTC advertising found 10% of those with 'adjustment disorder' symptoms and did not request a medication received one, vs. 39% of those making a general request and 55% making a brand-specific request. Between 1999 and 2005, DTC advertising increased from just under $1 billion to over $4 billion. Another - a medical school emphasis on 'reductionism' (understanding the mechanism by which a drug purportedly works), instead of empiricism (does the drug work).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG77YNHJAXX80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421417723#wasThisHelpful","RG77YNHJAXX80","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until you admit what you don't yet know, it is virtually impossible to learn what you need to. Today, far too much of what we 'know' is shaped by political or religious views. The world is also thick with 'entrepreneurs of error' (Edward Glaeser) that supply beliefs that increase their own financial or political returns.Many of today's important questions can't be answered merely by assembling a cluster of facts - they also require judgment and a guess as to how things will ultimately play out. With complex issues, it can be ridiculously hard to pin a particular result on a particular potential cause, and that's for events that have already occurred. It's even harder to predict what will work in the future. Yet we constantly hear from 'experts,' politicians, and business leaders, stock market gurus, and sports pundits who claim to have a pretty good idea of how the future will unwind.Philip Tetlock, psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, enlisted nearly 300 experts (eg. 96% with graduate degrees) to make thousands of predictions he then tracked over several years. They did slightly better than a baseline group of Berkeley undergrads, not as well as a computer programmed to predict 'No change.' (I don't know.) CXO Advisory Group covered over 6,000 predictions by stock market experts over several years - overall accuracy of 47.4%. The more prudent option in both instances - simply admit that you don't know.Most of us are also terrible at assessing our talent - eg. about 80% rate themselves as better than the average driver. A sizable body of research also says that those truly expert in their specific domains are NOT likely to be expert outside that domain.Unfortunately, in most cases the consequences of pretending to know are higher (for the individual) than the cost of being wrong. A huge payoff awaits anyone making a big bold prediction that comes true. And since almost nobody has a strong incentive to keep track of others' bad predictions, it costs almost nothing to pretend you know what will happen in the future. When bad predictions are unpunished, there's no incentive to stop making them.One of the best ways to solve problems is to start by putting away one's moral compass. A moral compass can convince you that the answers are obvious, even when they're not, that there's a bright line between right and wrong (often there isn't), and you already know all you need to know about the subject.Take the matter of suicide. David Lester, one of the world's leading authorities on the topic, has found estimates of the proportion of suicides mentally ill ranging from 5% to 94%.The key to learning is feedback - it is nearly impossible to learn anything without it. But the more complex a problem is, the harder to capture good feedback. You may even have to create feedback through experimentation. However, his rarely happens. Tradition, lack of expertise in experimentation, and the requirement that someone first say 'I don't know' limits such.'Awards' are often a marketing stunt - eg. to boost advertising by the winner.Now knowing all the answers is hard enough to accept. But knowing the right question can be even more difficult. Example - perhaps we should focus more on family support for education than education reform.Sometimes the 'root cause' of differences is several hundred years old - eg. the slightly higher earnings of German families in some areas was found linked to area leaders' decisions about religion 400+ years ago. Testing potential slaves in Africa for salty lips (indicative of ability to survive the sea voyage) also resulted in a likelihood that New World blacks would have a 50% higher rate of high blood pressure. (There is no such higher relative rate in Africa.)Sometimes it is best to think small. Big problems (eg. cancer) are usually a dense mass of intertwined small problems - tackling a small piece of a big problem is more likely to bring progress and require less subsequent change (always hard to accomplish) to impact. In a remote Chinese province, about 2,500 4th-6th graders needed glasses, but only 59 had them. Free glasses were given to half, and that subset had 25 - 50% better achievement than those without glasses. Big impact on a small problem.People respond to money, and the amount matters. Money is not the only incentive important to people.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S3Z83E4W4Q7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062218344#wasThisHelpful","R1S3Z83E4W4Q7A","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the beginning (of IT), the only way to get a computer to do anything was to write a very specific algorithm explaining what and how to do it. Need to decide whether layout A or B will land more customers - a web-learning system tries both and reports back. Most mutual funds use learning algorithms to help pick stocks, and one is completely run by a learning system. Learning algorithms decide whether to offer you a specific credit card, approved your application, looks for suspicious transactions, and tries to decide how happy your are with the card. If you applied to business school and took the GMAT recently, one of your essay graders was a learning system. Looking to buy a house? Zillow.com will estimate what each one you're considering is worth, a learning algorithm will study your loan application and recommend accepting/rejecting it. Unmanned vehicles pilot themselves across land, sea, and air. It's how a search engine figures out which results (and ads) to show u, how most of our spam is filtered out, NSA estimates whether you are a terrorist, and Facebook decides which updates to show us.Author Domingos proposes that all knowledge (past, present, and future) can be derived from data by a single, universal learning algorithm, the Master Algorithm.' At its core, machine learning is about prediction - what we want, results of our actions, how the world will change, etc. Shamans and soothsayers are too fallible - scientific predictions and big data much more accurate. With machine-learning algorithms, computers figure out what to do and how to do it themselves, by making inferences from data and past actions. The more data they have, the more intricate the algorithms can be. So now we don't always have to program computers - they can often program themselves.Most books on big data leave us with the impression that learning algorithms simply find correlations between pairs of events - eg. googling 'flu medicine' makes it likely one has the flu. Correlations, however, are like bricks vs. a house - only part of the ultimate product.Not all learning algorithms work the same. Amazon, if guiding you through a bookstore, would be more likely to take you to shelves previously frequented; Netflix's business model, however, depends on driving demand into the long tail of obscure movies and TV shows (cost it little) and away from blockbusters (your subscription isn't enough to pay for. (Netflix may have 100K DVD titles in stock, but if customers don't know how to find the ones they like, they'll default to choosing the hits. Only when Netflix has a learning algorithm to figure out your tastes and recommend DVDs that the long tail becomes useful.)The five main learning algorithms are symbolistic (inverse deduction), connectionist (inspired by neuroscience and physics - backpropagation), evolutionary (simulate evolution, and draw on genetic programming), Bayesians (learning is a form of probabability inference and has its roots in statistics), analogizers (extrapolate from similar judgments, influenced by psychology and mathematical optimization).The Industrial Revolution automated manual work, the Information Revolution did the same for mental work, but machine learning automates automation itself.Every algorithm can be reduced to AND, OR, and NOT. Too much complexity, however, makes an algorithm too intricate for humans to understand and/or inhabited by errors. The solution - the learning algorithm, written by the  computer. Given enough data, a learning program only a few hundred lines long can easily generate a program with millions of lines, and do this repeatedly for different problems. Some learning algorithms learn knowledge, and some learn skills (eg. driving).Businesses embrace machine learning because they have no choice. A first company (without machine learning) writes a thousand rules to predict what its customers want, while a second company's algorithms learn billions of rules - a whole set for each customer. Machine learning is the scientific method on steroids, automating discovery.In most fields, scientists have traditionally used only very limited kinds of models (eg. linear regression). Unfortunately, most phenomena are nonlinear. Machine learning opens up a new world of nonlinear models. Further, in machine learning, the same algorithm can both learn to play chess and process credit-card applications or diagnose patient ailments. They're also much simpler compared to the algorithms they replace - most learners can be coded in a few hundred lines, perhaps a few thousands with lots of bells and whistles. In contrast, the programs they replace can run in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of lines. Thus, if a few learners can do much, could one do everything?Backprop's first significant real-world applications, beginning in the early 1990s, came in predicting the stock market. They were able to beat linear models then often prevalent in finance because such systems could detect small patterns in very noisy data. A typical investment fund would train a separate network for each of a large number of stocks, let the network pick the most promising ones and then have human analysts decide which of those to invest in.The most promising treatments for cancer involve computers sifting through large amounts of data (eg. UCSC's Genome Browser) and matching cancer biopsy genomes to help craft treatments customized to an individual.Five Predictions: 1)Your personal model will know you better than your best friend. 2)You'll be independently wealthy. We'll all be unemployed, but will vote ourselves a guaranteed lifetime income and be much richer than when we had jobs. 3)A robot will do all our housework. 4)We'll think 'health problems' is an oxymoron. 5)You will control your own evolution.NaÔve Bayes is a learning algorithm that can be expressed as a single short equation. Given a database of patient records (symptoms, test results, and whether they have a particular condition, Na√Øve Bayes can learn to diagnose a condition in a fraction of a second, often better than doctors. It can also beat medical expert systems that took thousands of man-hours to build. The same algorithm is also widely used to provide spam filters.Another simple learner, the nearest-neighbor algorithm, has been used for handwriting recognition to controlling robot hands to recommending books and movies. Decision-tree learners are equally adept at deciding whether your credit-card application should be accepted, finding splice junctions in DNA, and choosing the next move in chess.In congenitally blind people, the visual cortex can take over other brain functions. February 2000, MIT neuroscientists reported in Nature that rewiring the brain of a ferret involving switching connections from the eyes to the auditory cortex, and from the ears to the visual cortex resulted in the auditory cortex learning to see, the visual cortex learning to hear, and the ferret was fine. In normal mammals, the visual cortex contains a map of the retina; neurons connected to nearby regions of the retina are close to each other in the cortex. If the visual input is redirected instead to the somatosensory cortex (responsible for touch perception), it too learns to see. Other mammals have this ability.Blind people can learn to 'see' with their tongues by sending video images from a head-mounted camera to an array of electrodes placed on the tongue - high voltages correspond to bright pixels and low voltages to dark ones. Ben Underwood was a blind youngster who taught himself echolocation to navigate. By clicking his tongue and listening to the echoes, he could walk w/o bumping into objects, ride a skateboard, and even play baseball. All evidence that the brain uses the same learning algorithm throughout, with areas dedicated to the different senses distinguished only by the different inputs (eyes, ears, nose) they are connected to.Examining the cortex under a microscope leads to the same conclusion because the same wiring pattern is repeated everywhere. The cortex is organized into columns with six layers. If someone's cerebellum is injured, the cortex takes over its functions. Thus, the cerebellum exists not because it does something the cortex can't, but because it's more efficient at it. Another point - the number of connections in one's brain is over 1 million times the number of letters in one's genome, so it's not physically possible for the genome to specify in detail how the brain is wired. Some contend that if we implement the brain in an algorithm, that algorithm can learn everything we can - and thus, would comprise the Master Algorithm.Evolution is an algorithm using a mechanism familiar to computer scientists - iterative search. Perhaps the true Master Algorithm contains elements of both evolution and the brain.If everything we experience is the product of a few simple laws, then it makes sense that a single algorithm can induce all that can be induced. The same equations applied to different quantities often describe phenomena in completely different fields - quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, fluid dynamics. Poisson's equations, as well as those describing eg. diffusion, once discovered in one field can be more readily discovered in others. Conceivable they are all instances of a master equation.Science goes through three phases - the Brahe, Kepler, and Newton phases. In the Brahe phase, we gather lots of data, like Tycho Brahe recording planet positions night after night, year after year. In the Kepler phase, we fit empirical laws to the data, like Kepler did to the planet's motions. In the Newton phase, we discover deeper truths (eg. F = ma). Most science consists of Brahe and Kepler-like work, Newton moments are rare. Today, big data does the work of billions of Brahes, and machine learning the work of millions of Keplers. More Newtonian moments are as likely to come from tomorrow's learning algorithms as its overwhelmed scientists.On the other hand, different algorithms do better on different problems. How could a single algorithm replace them all? The author's response is simply that such a situation would be preferable. However, because the potential impact is so great, it behooves us to try and invent the Master Algorithm even if the odds of success are low. Its pursuit also provides a better understanding of machine learning. And knowing the assumptions that different learners make helps us pick the right one for a job, instead of going with a random one for years and suffering because of it.Symbolists recognize that you can't learn from scratch - initial knowledge is needed, processed via inverse deduction which figures out what knowledge is missing in order to make a deduction go through, and then making it as general as possible. The connectionists' master algorithm (backpropagation) compares a system's output with the desired one and then successively changes the connections in layer after layer of neurons to  bring the output progressively closer to what it ought to be. The evolutionaries' Master Algorithm is genetic programming, which makes and evolves computer programs in the same way nature makes and evolves organisms. Bayes' theorem tells us how to incorporate new evidence into our beliefs, and probabilistic inference algorithms do that as efficiently as possible. For analogizers, the key to learning is recognizing similarities between situations and therefore inferring other similarities. The key problem is judging how similar two things are. The Master Algorithm must solve all five problems.The remainder of the book is taken up with detailed exploration of each of the five learner algorithm types.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MQJ73K1BT0PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465065708#wasThisHelpful","R1MQJ73K1BT0PY","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is about adult behavioral change. Goldsmith quickly points out that our reactions to various people/situations are usually the result of unappreciated triggers in our environment. Meaningful behavioral change is very hard to do. Impediments include inability to accept that we need to change, usually because we've reasoned our way into elaborate excuses to deny the need. We also generally do not appreciate inertia's power over us - it can easily last for years. And, we don't know how to execute change.No one can make us change unless we really want to. (Goldsmith applies this rule in choosing clients - staying away from those that really aren't committed to change.) For example, two-thirds of smokers who say they'd like to quit never try, 9 of 10 who do try, fail. Those who do succeed (the most motivated), fail on average 6 times before succeeding.Excuses to defer change efforts: 1)Today is a special day (eg. the Super Bowl, an anniversary, etc.). 2)'At least I'm better than . . . .' (I'm not the worst.) 3)I shouldn't need help and structure (look at the power of checklists in aviation and reducing surgery infections - simple things, but important when forgotten). 4)I won't get tired and let my enthusiasm fade. (Hand-washing compliance fades towards the end of long hospital shifts.) 5)I have all the time in the world - no urgency. 6)I won't get distracted. 7)An epiphany will suddenly change my life, my change will  be permanent and I will never have to worry again, no one is paying attention to me. 8)I have the wisdom to assess my own behavior.Much of the time our environment is the devil. Unrealistic job expectations, snarky companions, adversarial role expectations, being in a high-end mall.Feedback is key to successful and sustained behavior change.Situational Leadership: 1)Directing, for employees requiring a lot of specific guidance to complete a task, primarily a one-way conversation. Eg.: 'Here's what I'd like you to do, step by step.' 2)Coaching for those needing greater than average guidance to complete a task, for those who both need and want to learn; likely to also involve input/feedback from the employee. 3)Supporting, for employees having the skills needed to complete a task, but lacking the confidence to do it on their own. Features less than average amounts of direction. Eg. 'What do you think should be done?' 'How can I help you on this one?' 4)Delegating, for those employees scoring high on motivation, ability, and confidence. 'Here the assignment. You have a great track record. Ask if you need help, otherwise you're on your own.'One of the most common behavioral issues among leaders is succumbing to the temptation to exercise power when they'd be better off showing restraint. Politicians are masters of avoidance - terrorized by the potential of a gaffe. Thus, they avoid being seen with a polarizing public figure, abstain from controversial votes, and refuse to answer no-win press conference questions. The lesson: To avoid undesirable behavior, avoid the environments where it's most likely to occur - eg. avoid a colleague who gets on your nerves. Adjustment strategy - eg. modify your response to a situation such as childhood friends asking what you did that day - they're really not interested in the details.We have four options when pursuing behavioral change: 1)Create positive elements, 2)Preserve positive elements we want to keep, 3)eliminate the negative elements we want to eliminate, and 4)Accept the negative elements we need to accept in the future.Apologizing, asking for help, and optimism are magic moves - they are so easy to do, and effectively trigger decent behavior in others. Asking active questions is a fourth. When people are asked passive questions, they almost invariably provide environmental 'answers.' Thus, if an employee responds 'No' when asked, 'Do you have clear goals?' the reasons are attributed to external factors such as 'The company changes strategy every week.' The employee seldom looks within themselves to take responsibility and says 'It's my fault.' The result is that when companies take the next step and ask for positive suggestions about making changes, employee answers again focus on the environment, not themselves. ""Managers need to be trained in goal-setting,' etc. Thus, passive questions can be the natural enemy of taking personal responsibility and demonstrating accountability, giving people unearned permission to pass the buck to anyone and anything else.An active question would be 'Did you do your best to set clear goals for yourself?' The Difference is employee engagement. Six daily 'engaging questions:' 1)Did I do my best to set clear goals today? No clear goals, no engagement. 2)Did I do my best to make progress towards my goals today? Employees with a sense of making progress are more engaged than those who aren't. 3)Did I do my best to find meaning today? 4)Did I do my best to be happy today? We usually find happiness internally. 5)Did I do my best to build positive relationships today? One of the best ways to have a best friend is to be a best friend. 6)Did I do my best to be fully engaged today? Class attendees in 79 of Goldsmith's ten-day sessions reported 37% improved on all six measures, 65% on at least four items, 89% improved on at least one item, 11% no changes. Given people's demonstrable reluctance to change, the studies show active self-questioning can trigger a new way of interacting with the world. Similarly, questions that reflect your objectives can hep bring positive change for you. The phrases 'Did I do my best to . . . .' triggers trying.Unfortunately, within two weeks, half stopped answering the questions. It seems that falling short on our goals leads to either abandoning the questions or taking action.Making big decisions late in the day risks doing so when tired. Structured approaches to decision-making also helps reduce this likelihood.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHP0NJ20WAD0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804141231#wasThisHelpful","RHP0NJ20WAD0S","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fred Schwed, a stockbroker whose father lost everything as a Wall Street short seller during the 1920s, wrote this book in 1940. The title refers to an old joke: a tourist being shown the fancy boats in the harbor is told 'These are the bankers' and stockbrokers' yachts.' When he asks, 'Where are the customers' yachts?' he is told that there aren't any. Schwed's point is to cast doubt on the ability of the financial services industry to provide any really valuable advice to its customers. Today, the individual investor is still situated at the bottom of the food chain in a sea of predators. Secondly, that markets are unpredictable. That doesn't matter if you're investing for the long haul, because all the stock markets perform well in the long term - it's trying to do better than average that causes all the trouble. Schwed's coverage of the issues of the 1930s and 1940s also make clear, when compared to today's follies, that people never seem to change.What is really fatal is to try to increase one's income by putting a nest egg into riskier investments. Most of the time, if there are two similar investments and one offers a better return than the other, it is because it is a riskier investment. Look for other ways of coping if one's nest egg is not providing sufficient income - tightening your belt, getting a part-time job, or selling a few things you have in the house.It is not always easy to tell the difference between investment and speculation. Real speculators will speculate on anything the market is doing - whether it is going up, down or sideways. Beginners typically think of picking a few winning shares, then selling out when the price goes up and making a quick profit. Two problems - very few are good at consistently picking winning shares (Buffett's methods are not available to the ordinary investor), and most beginners have no idea how to evaluate a particular company or to assess the risks of a given investment. Figures used in financial reports seem to have the bad habit of expressing a small part of the truth, and neglecting the rest. All theories are true part of the time, none true all of the time - thus, they are dangerous, but sometimes useful. However, if you choose the right business and run it well, your chances of making large profits are usually better than speculating in the stock market.Customers have a bad habit of asking about the financial future. They almost always get detailed answers from Wall Street, rarely the truth - 'I don't know.'On my very first day in Wall Street (early 1927), I heard considerable foolishness, though I didn't spot it then. 'Deep Thinking' is mostly second guessing. Figures used in financial arguments have the bad habit of expressing a small part of the truth forcibly (eg. a preferred stock earning its dividend 50X over), and neglecting the other part (eg. the unholy size of the senior unfunded debt). On the other hand, if we had all the figures, plus all the pertinent footnotes, which to a greater or lesser extent invalidate most of the figures, we would have something.Turns out today's chart systems were alive and well in the 1920s. Aside from the basic 'head-and-shoulders,' 'double tops,' double bottoms,' etc. Schwed notes that extravagant  complexity is also possible. He sees it sharing a pedestal with astrology, yet most chartists are educated men and have too much mental discipline to take astrology seriously. He sees it as also reminiscent of farmer's almanacs which predict the weather for the next 365 days. (They do well noting that it gets hot each summer and cold each winter, they do not do well calling their shots day by day.' A busted chart reader is never apologetic about his method - if anything, he's more enthusiastic than solvent devotees. If you ask how it happens that he is broke, he tells you that he made the error of not believing his own charts. He doesn't mind so much losing his money, but it's more than he could stand to lose faith in his beloved chart system.As for accounting - it is not even an art, simply a state of mind. He cites the instances of McKesson and Roberts, along with Interstate Hosiery Mills. Both corporations had flourished, chiefly on assets that weren't there. Presumably these corporations' securities would never had taken their dives if only the non-existent assets hadn't been destroyed by having their non-existence discovered. One wonders if a great corporation is toppling over, does it do anyone any harm if no one knows that it is toppling over?And on to puts, calls, straddles, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM7XCRI21S4C7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0471770892#wasThisHelpful","RM7XCRI21S4C7","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why should you want power? Having power is related to living a longer and healthier life - the degree of job control (decision authority and discretion) predicted the incidence and mortality risk from coronary artery disease more than obesity and blood pressure. Second, power and the visibility and stature that accompany it can produce wealth. Third, power is a part of leadership - ergo, leaders are invariably preoccupied with power. People think that if they do a good job and behave appropriately, things will take care of themselves. However, the belief that the world is a just place anesthetizes people to the need to be proactive in building a power base.Leaders touting their own careers frequently gloss over the power plays they used to get to the top. Pfeffer also contends that while the teaching on leadership is filled with prescriptions on  being modest, truthful, not being abusive, etc., the path to power bears little resemblance to that advice. As for being rewarded for doing a good job, Pfeffer cites examples involving highly successful leaders (eg. Rudy Crew - Miami-Dade School Supt, Ken Kizer - VA Health Administration leader, Jamie Dimon at Citibank, Arthur Blank and Bernard Marcus at Handy Dan Home Improvement Centers, and Steve Jobs at Apple - all exemplary successes at their posts, yet forced out; meanwhile, there are also numerous CEOs who kept their jobs despite very poor organizational outcomes. (Eg. According to one study, CEOs presiding over three straight years of poor performance, followed by bankruptcy, only faced a 50% chance of losing their jobs. Having a significant ownership position, a mostly 'inside' board helped protect those failed CEOs.)You should not assume that your boss knows or notices what you are accomplishing - your first responsibility is to ensure that those at higher levels know what you are accomplishing, and the best way to ensure they know is to tell them. Most people believe they know what their bosses care about - but, it is much more effective to ask them, on a regular basis, what aspects they think are the most crucial and how they see what you ought to be doing. Asking for assistance, in a way that still conveys your competence and command of the situation, is an effective way of flattering those with power over you.Worry about the relationship you have with your boss at least as much as you worry about your job performance. If your boss makes a mistake, see if someone else will point it out; if you do it yourself, do it in a way that does not implicate that individual's own self-concept. Most people underestimate the effectiveness of flattery and therefore underutilize it.One way to provide feedback to high-level executives, who mostly have huge egos, is to focus on emphasizing what people need to do to get ready for subsequent positions and career challenges, rather than giving feedback about what they have done right and wrong in the past. Get advice from others who will tell you the truth about yourself.The two fundamental dimensions that distinguish those who rise to great heights are 'will,' the drive to take on big challenges, and 'skill,' the capabilities required to turn ambition into accomplishment. The three personal qualities embodied in will are ambition, energy ('You don't change the world by first taking a nap.' Laura Esserman; sleep less), and focus. The four skills useful in acquiring power are self-knowledge (eg. extensive reading) and a reflective mindset (eg. review prior actions for opportunities to improve), confidence and the ability to project self-assurance, the ability to read others and empathize with their point of view (eg. know what they want, understand the N. Vietnamese point of view - McNamera), and a capacity to tolerate conflict (eg. stand up to Rahm Emmanuel, Steve Jobs).Intelligence seldom accounts for much more than 205 of the variation in work performance, and the relationship between performance and attaining power is equally weak. A meta-analysis examining 85 data sets from a variety of countries concluded that the correlation between intelligence and income was 0.4. People who are smart think they can do everything on their own and do it better than everyone else - thus, they may fail to bring others along with them. Being smart can cause overconfidence and even arrogance - leading to the loss of power. And many of the people who seem to have the most difficulty putting themselves in other's place are those who are so smart they can't understand why the others don't get it.Diagnosing departmental power important for deciding where to begin work in an organization. Pfeffer suggests looking at relative pay for various departments, physical location (nearest top management) and facilities, representation on committees and in senior management. However, starting within a strong power base likely also entails stronger competition.'Authority is 20% given, 80% taken.' If you are going to take power, you need to project confidence. Give people your full attention - eg. put away the iPhone. Research shows that people who express anger are seen as 'dominant, strong, competent, and smart,' while sad and guilty people are viewed as low-status. Dressing up is also helpful.If someone challenges the strategy - eg. how a company is competing, measuring success, what the strategy is, who the real competitors are now and in the future - this can be a very potent power play. The need to resist an external threat (eg. United Airlines, IBM), real of imagined, has always been an extremely effective rallying cry for strengthening group solidarity. Lists (eg. three items) make a speaker appear as if he has thought about the issue thoroughly. Use 'us vs. them' constructs structured favorably to your ideas. (Do you want greedy insurance companies who drop people when they get sick deciding on your care, or would you like to leave those decisions to you and your doctor?) Avoid using a script or notes. Use humor where appropriate - eg. Reagan's reference to his opponents youth (vs. his own age).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4QUTLBVQU9BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061789089#wasThisHelpful","R4QUTLBVQU9BM","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author Kaplan has a Ph.D. in computer science, worked at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab early in his career, founded numerous companies - including GO Corporation, whose technology was used to develop the first smartphone and tablet pc. He currently is a Fellow at the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics.Technology has been displacing human jobs since the Industrial Revolution. Now that pace is accelerating, and it is becoming more and more difficult to find alternative employment for those displaced. We need to be asking 'Do labor-saving robots spell a new era of massive unemployment/low-wage employment for American workers?' Kaplan sees persistent unemployment and increasing income inequality as already plaguing our society even as the economy grows. He worries that widespread poverty may become the background for escalating comfort and wealth for a few. Another worry - that electronic agents empowered to take actions on behalf of the narrow self-interests of their owners may quickly and stealthily create problems for the rest of the world (eg. the 'Flash Crash' of 2010). What about an autonomous car that refuses to speed you to a hospital to save you from a heart attack? Will we be able to maintain social stability?It's increasingly looking like Karl Marx was partly right - the inevitable struggle between capital and labor is a losing one for workers. Except now we're almost all workers - including managers, doctors, college professors, analysts, etc. There is even the possibility that the 1% of today who own a very large share of society's resources may shrink even further. Meanwhile, what about the incredible capabilities of some mathematicians and programmers focused simply making money through financial trading or placing customized ads on everyone's computer screens, instead of new products that would improve lives and/or our global environment?Computer capabilities are expanding at an amazing pace - CPU speeds roughly doubling every two or so years, and memory prices rapidly declining. IBM's Watson in 2011 had access to 200 million pages of content consuming four terabytes of memory - today one can obtain that same amount of disk storage from Amazon for about $150/year. (I began computer programming in 1967, and we thought 64K of memory was a big deal! One could even see each bit of memory whenever a technician opened up the mainframe cabinet.) More recently we've seen breakthroughs in the field of machine perception, aided by machine learning and sophisticated and inexpensive cameras.Today, securities trades initiated by computer programs dominate the stock markets, furiously grinding away to gain fractions of a cent from inefficiencies between markets. We also now have automatic caddies, front-desk help in a Japanese hotel, can obtain directions and inventory information from robots greeting us at hardware stores, litigators using software that quickly scans millions of documents for legal purposes, IBM's Watson offering advice on cancer treatment, self-driving cars and trucks, machines that harvest only fruit that is ripe and ready, overseas computer hackers stealing millions of dollars by raiding millions of accounts, etc. The future will also likely bring solar-powered human-seeking robotic insects that can sneak through door jams and ventilation shafts to deliver lethal poison to anyone or just targeted individuals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YUYTI63RFM6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EVWC4G#wasThisHelpful","R2YUYTI63RFM6J","A22RY8N8CNDF3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RY8N8CNDF3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The quality is great and I'm highly impressed by the amount of bass that the speaker has, a lot of Bluetooth speakers do not have much bass.It was very easy to pair up with a phone right out of the box, and it did have some charge so I was able to use it right away. I like the size as it's not overly big that it can't be portable, but big enough that it puts out such a great sound and can easily be heard at a large party or outdoor gathering.Another great feature is that this can actually be used outdoors as it's semi rugged and water resistant.

"These are absolutely wonderful pens!

After trying a few different popular brands and styles, I was able to try these and fell in love!They are considered markers, though they do not bleed through whatsoever! No matter how hard I write or how many dark colors I use, they do not bleed through to the other side of the page unlike literally every other pen I've tried. The colors included are perfect for getting a diverse color system set up for your planner(or other needs), though a few of the colors are a bit too light to see on paper other than maybe using these for coloring, etc. However I don't personally see myself using 4 different shades of pink for planning so it's not an issue at all for me.Most importantly is how wonderfully they write. I didn't have an issue with a single pen other than those few being a bit too light. They write consistently and my handwriting is great with them. The carrying case they come in is perfect, too. The manufacturer graphics are just inserted, so they can easily come out if you want to put your own graphics or scrapbook paper inside the case to make it even more pretty! I like it as is so I can see all the colors on my desk.While I'm sure these pens are also great for drawing/coloring, if you are a planner addict like I'm starting to be, these are a must have!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10RDN3O4FTNLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QDE32KW#wasThisHelpful","R10RDN3O4FTNLA","AL3DY8L28E740","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL3DY8L28E740?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These snoring aids are a nice permanent solution to going through tons of disposable breathe right strips. They also stay on a whole lot better. My husband has a big issue with snoring, and often has sinus problems, so we used to use breathe right strips. However, they get costly having to use one almost every night.These are such a nice option to have. They're easy to use and a bit odd to get used to, but not uncomfortable.

After the super easy set up and waiting under 30 seconds for the steam to come out, I was able to clean the majority of my kitchen floor in under 5 minutes.I found that lingering on the spots for a few seconds then going back over the area was the best way to get off those stubborn stains.

"I really like the design of this watch band for the Jawbone Up Move, however the clasp broke on it after only a few weeks of wear. The color and the thinness of the band are super cute, but the clasp itself is not designed the same way that the actual Jawbone branded watch straps are. This is a small clasp that just sits in a notch.I had read some bad reviews stating that the clasps broke easily and the watch could sometimes be lost, but prior to it breaking I only had the issue of the clasp coming out of the notch a few times. When it broke I was just sitting at the bar, so luckily I was able to catch it, but did not bump it hard or anything to cause the clasp to actually break.If you are not too concerned with having to buy a few of these(luckily they are cheap), then it's definitely worth it to have a girly watch band for your Jawbone.

"While I like these pants overall, there are a couple annoying things about them that lead me to probably not purchasing this type of Dickies in the future.First and foremost is not having front pockets. I really only ever wear these when I specifically need to wear khakis for a particular store that I'm working at(I'm a product/reset merchandiser) and therefore need to carry with me all kinds of small tools and pens/markers, my phone, etc. It was really hard to fit even the basics in the two back pockets.The second is the super tight fit in the legs and hips/butt. I found the waist to be a very expected fit for the size I ordered, but it was super tight everywhere else. Most other Dickies I have worn are fairly loose throughout, I was surprised to find that these were so fitted.If you are looking for a more classy or fitted pair of khakis, these would not be bad to buy.

"This is a very nice, plain, simple case for your LG G4. If you are looking to add protection, but don't want anything flashy or bulky, this would definitely be the case to get. It's slim but also keeps your phone protected from smaller drops or bumps.The matte black color is nice and easy to keep clean and it's not overly flashy. It feels more like a plastic case but has the added benefit of being a very lightweight flexi silicone style case.

"If you are looking for a true white LED bulb, this is the one to get! I've used quite a few different LED bulbs,and have been amazed by the amount of light they put out and how bright they are, but I've never used one that was so true of a white as this bulb.I got this bulb to replace the one in my main living room lamp(so I could use that bulb for another tiny lamp), I wasn't expecting the bulb to be so huge! You'll definitely want to use this with a lighting device that has an open top or a very wide opening where the bulb will fit. It's a standard size bulb, but for a good second I thought I had accidentally ordered an industrial one or something!The amount of light this puts out is a tad bit lower than the other LED bulbs I've used, but it's only in appearance. You can tell an off white glow from a mile away, whereas this looks way more like natural light so it doesn't make the bulb stand out like a sore thumb.

"I really like my new tablet keyboard case. The description was a bit misleading as I thought it was fitted especially for my otherwise impossible to find cases for LG G-Pad 8.0, but it's just a generic sized case. However, it fits it perfectly, so I don't mind at all.I have used a couple generic cases for tablets over the years, and always found the ones that have clip on holders to either fit too large or too small for most tablets. These clips stretch just the right amount to fit my tablet and holds it snugly in place, without worry if they're going to pop off or not. The keyboard is also the perfect size for my 8"" tablet, though I imagine it would look perfect with my older 7"" tablet as well.The keyboard did take some time to pair up, mostly because I made it more difficult than it needed to be. I work with tech devices constantly so am used to having to hold a button to pair a Bluetooth device, or watch for a blinking or solid light. However, once you turn this keyboard on(another nice function, a physical on/off key), it goes into pairing mode without needing to push anything else. It does take a couple minutes for it to be searchable by your device, though, that's the part I didn't wait for at first! Once it was paired it connected in no time at all.The keyboard itself is a bit small, but it's exactly what you'd expect size wise to have with a tablet. The case can sit up by itself if you wish to prop up your tablet and keyboard on a desk and use it like a laptop, or you can lay it out flat. It did not feel flimsy or unstable at all whenever I've had it propped up.The only other downside I could see is very minimal, once you have your tablet clipped in, the loop over closure seems to either stick out or fit behind your tablet a bit awkwardly. Nothing that would even warrant me rating this below 5 stars, however. Overall if you are looking for a colored and cute keyboard case for a tablet, I highly suggest checking this one out.*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R3Y9J33RI5IG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XDNNRKG#wasThisHelpful","R2R3Y9J33RI5IG","AL3DY8L28E740","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL3DY8L28E740?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:42 Mins This LED speaker is so cool! While it's not overly large(though bigger than it appears in my video), it puts out a great sound and has a surprising amount of bass for a Bluetooth speaker. I was also pleased to see that it takes an SD card, so you can just load it up and take it anywhere.Of course the best part are the unique colorful led lights. They go completely around the speaker, aside from a very thin strip where the speaker name is. I love that there's multiple modes, too, so you can change up how the led's flash. If you watch my video, I start to change the modes at about 12 seconds in and pause it during each shift. My favorite is the last! These are really bright and pretty and make this speaker one of a kind.The controls for the speaker are along the bottom by the stand, and along with having press buttons for pause, play, etc, there's a button to control the color mode, as well as an actual on/off switch so it can't be accidentally bumped on.If you're looking for a speaker to really make your party or event, and also sound really amazing, get this!

"This 4 piece gift set of essential oils by Ovvio is wonderful. Not only are the oil blends amazing, the packaging is adorable. This would be so easy to order and immediately wrap up for a very lavish gift. I had a hard time taking them from their box and adding them to the rest of my box of oils!The four blends are all very unique and potent. My favorite of the bunch is the Slumber blend. If you pop some of this in a bedroom diffuser at night, you are sound asleep in no time flat. The scent is amazing and I sometimes just blend this to have the smell diffuse throughout my house.The Inhale blend is my favorite to use in the bathroom or during times of bad allergies. The eucalyptus and peppermint(among others) are so perfect for clearing up the sniffles and helping with breathing. I love to turn it on during a shower for a mini spa session.Unwind and Enhance are each good for their own stress relieving properties, I like to just diffuse them at different times and have my house smell great! Unwind really makes you feel calm and the scents make you feel at peace. Enhance is also nice for calming the mind, though it has extra oils that keep the mind a bit more alert but stress free.If you are just getting into essential oils, or have only previously used pure single scent oils, this is a very useful starter kit. Even if you have used some similar stress free or sleep blends, I highly recommend trying Ovvio's blends as they are the best I've tried!*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEALSB4VPPA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5FW9VE#wasThisHelpful","R2MEALSB4VPPA1","AL3DY8L28E740","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL3DY8L28E740?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is all around a very nice, simple oil diffuser. I have quite a few in my house as I've grown mildly(okay, completely) obsessed with diffusing essential oils, and they all seem to have their ups and downs.While this diffuser is fairly small in that it doesn't take a ton of water at once, I really like that it has just a very simple button operation over a remote like another similar one I have. I also enjoy that it has a burst setting, not many diffusers do. This is perfect for use at night in the bedroom when I want to use an oil that has a pretty strong scent and I don't want it continuously going and keeping me up.The subtle white glow is also a nice change of pace, it's beyond perfect for use in the bedroom since it's not too flashy, but you can tell when it's on. Maintenance on this diffuser is very simple due to the cord plug in at the bottom of the unit, and the little cleaning brush to get your extra oils out or to clean around the edges on the inside where buildup can occur.If you're in the market for a diffuser that's not too flashy or big but puts out a great mist, this is the one for you!*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5CZXKVY3N4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR2CDJG#wasThisHelpful","R3K5CZXKVY3N4U","AL3DY8L28E740","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL3DY8L28E740?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before getting this toner and looking up the actual benefits/uses of facial toners, I honestly thought they all were basically astringents. I have used a few here and there but typically shy away from them for long term use as they can be harsh and very drying. This toner is exactly the opposite - it is so conditioning and moisturizing. It almost feels like you're spritzing yourself with water, so can be very refreshing after a hot day or using very hot water to clean your skin.The scent is a bit odd but goes away very fast. The sprayer is super convenient for putting it on as well, no more fumbling to put toner on a cotton pad or sponge and rub it in and worry about getting enough on the skin.

If you are into making your own beauty products like I am, this is wonderful for adding to bath bombs and cuticle/hand oils due to all of the skin ailments(dryness, patchiness, marks, etc) that it combats. It's super conditioning which is important to have in those types of products. It's also great on it's own or mixed as a high quality but all natural make up remover, one of it's great benefits is that while it conditions your face it also helps with acne, so no worries about a harsh product causing you breakouts.It's also a really nice oil to use for massages or rubbing in other essential oils. It does not block the properties of a muscle relaxing oil, for example, but makes it easier to rub in and helps it to actually sink in without it being wasted sitting on the skin.

"Although this oil is meant for beards, my husband rarely grows out his facial hair long enough to have a use to moisturize it with oils. Instead I've begun using it myself for various reasons. I make a lot of beauty/bath items, especially cuticle oil and mani or bath bombs, and having great oils in them is crucial. This blend is absolutely perfect for them, even though its targeted for men.

You can easily keep your meat out of your mashed potatoes and corn. They also work well for taking half a sandwich and fruits and veggies, etc. The possibilities are endless.I like to use the round containers for leftover soup,  chili, or fruit. but they work out great for other things as well.

"I have had two discs replaced in my spine (neck area), I have a metal rod in my leg, a metal plate and several screws. I also have nerve issues in my wrists. So, I often find myself in pain and in need of some assistance. I have a variety of heat pads and massage tools. I am happy that I now have this bag in my collection. This microwavable heat bag is great for the price. It comes with a thick, soft, fleece cover on the outside. The one downfall is that the cover is not removable for washing. However, I think it is appropriate for the price. I wouldn't recommend tossing the entire thing in the washer/dryer. So, you need to try to keep it clean and spot clean as necessary.In a minute or less of the microwave (I recommend putting it on a paper towel or paper plate to protect the cover), it is ready to go. It is the perfect size for sore wrists or headaches. It also drapes well over your shoulder, or can be used when sitting back in a chair for your neck. I have even used it for my lower back. It stays warm for a decent amount of time (20-30 minutes) and it does not get so hot that it burns your skin. It is also perfectly filled which is normally not the case with microwavable heat bags. I would definitely buy another one and I probably will. I recommend this product.

"If you are looking for a wireless speaker that can have your entire house rocking (subject to the size of your house), then this speaker is for you. We have several tiny bluetooth speakers that we use throughout our 3 bedroom house. We have always wanted a larger speaker that we could hear clearly everywhere. This Denon HEOS 5 did not disappoint. It is a decent sized speaker at 14.8 x 9.8 x 13.5 inches and just over 11 pounds.We set the speaker up as soon as it arrived. It was easy to setup via Wifi with our Samsung Galaxy phones. You do have to plug your phone into the speaker via cable to setup. We were able to have it running in just a few short minutes. The speaker has great sound quality, bass and gets super loud! We have it on top of a book shelf in our dining room (which is at the entrance and towards the center of our house). We can clearly hear the speaker playing throughout the house.Now for the few issues we have and the reason for 4/5 stars. The first major issue is that it often gets disconnected somehow. When this happens, we have to plug our phones back in and log back into our password protected Wifi. It is a pain and it is made more difficult since our speaker is located on top of a book shelf that is up high. We could move it, but that is our preferred spot for it. It keeps it out of the way. The app is also a pain to use. We still have not figured out how to turn the dang thing off. We normally resort to turning off our Wifi to get it to stop playing music. Maybe we are missing something? I don't know, but we are both pretty technological adept and we can not figure it out.Overall, we still really love the speaker. 90%+ of the time it works great and we do not have any issues. I wish it was Bluetooth instead. However, we are happy to have it in our home. I would still recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I8I1Q9AUSXQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJJW39I#wasThisHelpful","R2I8I1Q9AUSXQJ","A39WWMBA0299ZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39WWMBA0299ZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Lucien Piccard Men's watch is very nice looking. It comes in a gorgeous and well made gift box. It has a classic and timeless look, it has gold, but not too much, and it has a genuine leather band. Unfortunately, there is a ""deployment clasp"" at the end of that gorgeous leather band that is a deal breaker and makes this watch unviable for everyday wear.When the watch arrived, my Husband and myself were both pretty impressed with it. It was even nicer looking in person than in the pictures. My Husband immediately went to try it on. Then he said, ""What? I don't understand."" This made me stop what I was doing and come look because my Husband is the type of guy that figures everything out easily...especially mechanical issues. He showed me the clasp and I was confused too. We looked at the small instruction booklet and did not see anything about the clasp. After about 5-10 more minutes of tinkering with it, my Husband figured it out.The clasp is a real pain to use. If you have a small wrist, you may be able to keep the clasp on the opposite end and save some time. However, my Husband has a large wrist. He has to take it completely apart every time. He also showed me how he has to ""guess"" which hole is right each time since you don't know if you have it right until it is all the way fastened. This is hard to understand without actually seeing the watch in action, but trust me that it is not worth your time. Even with my Husband knowing how to work the watch, it takes several minutes to put on. He will wear this watch occasionally, but it will be rare. He needs a watch that goes on in seconds, not minutes.While this watch would probably get 5 stars without the clasp, the clasp will be a deal-breaker for most people. I do not recommend this watch. There are much more user friendly watches out there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14WKHBSN9F9FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015K87GHG#wasThisHelpful","R14WKHBSN9F9FS","A39WWMBA0299ZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39WWMBA0299ZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this silver mini floating Mom locket necklace as a gift for my Mom. It arrived today and I could not be happier! It is perfect. I have always loved the idea of floating charm lockets, but I always thought they looked a little cheap or clunky. This mini locket is the perfect alternative if you want something that is more sleek and nicer looking. This locket is 2.8 x 1.4 x 0.5 inches or slightly bigger than my thumb. I have my thumb in one of the pictures for reference. The pictures really do not do this beautiful necklace justice. The silver is smooth and shiny, so it doesn't photograph well.The locket comes with a necklace and charms, which is awesome. You normally have to buy those separately. The charms and the locket all look nice. The charms do have a tendency to move around a lot in the locket. The Mom charm sometimes flips over or both the charms will slide and get stuck on top of each other. I am not sure if there is an easy solution for that. I have seen disc charms for the larger lockets, but I don't know if they make them this small. I kind of like the see through look better anyhow. The locket is easy to open and fix the charms. The necklace that comes with the locket has little silver balls every inch or so. It looks nice with the locket. Or, you could put the locket on a regular silver chain to make it look even nicer. I am going to send it to my Mom as is because I know she will love it.I do want to mention that the charms, necklace and locket all come in separate plastic bags. So, you will want to buy a small box or re-purpose an old jewelry box to gift this item.I love this necklace so much that I am asking my Husband to buy me one for Christmas. So, I would definitely recommend it.

"I really like this La Roche-Posay Serum. I have uneven, red skin and I was hoping to even out my skin tone some. I don't think it has evened out my skin tone yet, but I have only been using it for about 2 weeks. However, it does make my skin look much healthier and more vibrant. It seems to moisturize my skin pretty well too. The serum is soft and applies easily. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy. I also have sensitive skin and it did not burn or irritate my face at all.

"I received the 12 Piece ""stripe"" set. First of all, I want to say the picture on this listing is not currently correct and needs to be fixed. The typed description is correct. This set has eight plates (in two different sizes) and four bowls. The bowls are the standard smaller sized bowls that typically come with sets like this. They are good for small side salads, soup, etc.I wasn't really sure what to expect with this set. I know that Lenox is a nicer and pricer brand. I was hoping they wouldn't be heavy like China plates, but I was hoping they would still be really nice and justify the price. They did not disappoint me! This is a very well made set. However, it is not too heavy. The plates could easily be used as everyday dinnerware. We personally are going to save them for when we have guests over.The design is really neat because it is not your typical boring stripe. The strips are slightly swiggly which makes the plates have character, but still look nice. The plates have a slight curve to them to help keep food on the plate. The bowls are a really nice size for sides and possibly cereal if you actually stick to the serving size (does anyone do that)?Is this dish set in my normal price range? No. Is it worth the money? Maybe. I personally would not spend $200 (the current price) on a 12 piece set of dishes. However, if you have it in your budget, I don't think that this set would disappoint you. I definitely recommend it if price is not an issue!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MT08UXV0WPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014W2Z1AK#wasThisHelpful","R2MT08UXV0WPL","A39WWMBA0299ZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39WWMBA0299ZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Epson printers have definitely come along way since the one that I had about a decade ago. This all in one printer, scanner and copier is relatively small at 10.4 x 19.1 x 16.8 inches and just over 20 pounds. It was easy for us to set up the wifi and the printer and start printing in less than 20 minutes. Of course, we do have a lot of experience with setting printers up. So, it may take you a little longer. We also set up our phones to have the capability to print directly from them without issue.The printer has a wide rear feed tray to print off 11x17 photos which is awesome! My previous printers only had the capability to do standard size paper and photos. The photos come out crisp, clear and vibrant. It definitely prints professional quality photos. It also prints directly onto dvd's which is great if you make your own cd/dvd's. It prints the photos at a much faster rate than my older printer (which is a few years old now and probably out of date). The smaller photos I printed came flying out and the standard letter size I printed took around a minute. I have to buy some printer paper in 11x17, but I can't wait to test that size out. It will make for great wall decorations.I also love the 2 sided printing. I sometimes need this function for my school work. It saves my back and shoulder since most of my materials have to be printed, placed into a binder and carried with me daily. Overall, I really love this printer and I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCRS3QU7Q7ZTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5Y1O#wasThisHelpful","RCRS3QU7Q7ZTY","A39WWMBA0299ZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39WWMBA0299ZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE this product. This is the 2nd scent that I have received and my favorite scent so far. I was skeptical before I received the first bottle, but after I tried it, I knew I had to order more scents. This stuff really works! You just spray the toilet a few times until it forms a film on the water (you will see it). The scent immediately starts to waft up. Then, as you go to the bathroom the scent is trapped under the film. It is amazing. No more stink. Now when you say your poop doesn't stink, you are telling the truth. Sort of. This is great for everyone. If you are embarrassed of your foul odor, this will solve your problem. If you are not embarrassed by your odor, but your family does not want to smell it, this will fix your problem. It is so much better than sprays that attempt to mask the scent and end up making the whole bathroom smell even worse. The coconut and lime scent smells wonderful.  I definitely recommend giving Mask a shot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZFHJ6GHJSZVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLP1ZC0#wasThisHelpful","RZFHJ6GHJSZVR","A39WWMBA0299ZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39WWMBA0299ZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been buying non-GE replacement filters every since I first replaced my filter in my refrigerator. You save a lot of money this way and they are just as high quality. That is true of this Eternawater MWF filter. It is easy to replace. You just pull off the only filter and pop this one in. This one does say to submerge in cold water for 15 minutes before inserting. I have never seen that before, but it is easy to do. Then, you have to run it to get out the sediment. This particular filter has to be flushed for 3 gallons. I love that it says an amount on the filter. My previous one said just to ""flush"". The water comes out clear and tasting great after it is flushed.

"This is a fantastic brush set for the price! I use brushes for applying almost all of my makeup. I feel like I can never have too many of them. I particularly like the larger and Kabuki style brushes because they blend my face makeup really well.When this set arrived I noticed that it contained a note about the smell. It said that if it smells, just wash the brushes to get rid of the smell. This really is no big deal since you should be washing them before using anyhow. I have a makeup brush cleaner, but liquid soap or gentle shampoo works too. My brushes did smell like plastic. I washed two of the brushes that I would be using right away and the smell was gone. I then tossed the remaining brushes on my vanity for later washing. When I came in to wash them two days later...they didn't smell anymore!! So, the smell will vanish once they are out of the plastic bag for a bit. You really should still wash them for sanitary reasons.I also love that this set comes with a paper telling you which brushes are best for which makeup. It can be kind of hard to tell the difference between some of them. You really could use any of the larger brushes interchangeably. The bristles on the brushes are thick and soft. I have not had them to fall out at all. I did have one brush with a long bristle, but I just cut it off with scissors. The brushes work great. I would definitely recommend this set!*I received this product at a discount in exchange for m honest, unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VG118NU3JRBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOW827M#wasThisHelpful","R2VG118NU3JRBE","A39WWMBA0299ZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39WWMBA0299ZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are SO disappointed! We have a Playstation 3 and are planning on buying a Playstation 4 in the near future. So, we were excited to receive this hard drive. The Amazon page says that it has a simple installation. IT DOES NOT. When it arrived we were excited and opened it immediately. All that is in the box for instruction is a piece of paper that says to go to their website (www.seagate.com/playstation). Once we arrived at the website, there are no instructions for Playstation 3 or any mention of it. We decided to watch the Playstation 4 video and hoped that it had similar installation. One of the first things that the video tells you is what you need to install it. Yes, you need a screwdriver. You also need:1- USB external hard drive large enough for all your game data2- USB Flash drive large enough for the Playstation operating system that you will have to reinstallWhat the heck? So you spend over $100 on this hard drive and have to spend even more money on an external hard drive and a flash drive if you don't have one? On top of that you have to download all of your information, change the hard drive, download the operating system from the Playstation website, upload the operating system, etc. This is the short version and missing a lot of steps, but you get the idea. Also, the transfer of your information makes sense, but how come this drive doesn't come with the operating system if it is exclusively for Playstation?? I don't like the thought of installing the operating system. Make sure you watch the installation video before buying this product because it is lengthy and ridiculous.At this point, I don't think that we will be installing this until we buy a Playstation 4. We are not going to spend the extra money for an external hard drive and we don't want to lose our current games. Please make sure you know what you are getting into before buying this.

Unfortunately, the two together make my hair feel greasy and oily only an hour or two after showering.

With shampoo, you have to scrub it into the roots and all the hair. Regardless, this product was not for me. If you have dry hair, or oil is not an issue for you, then it may work wonders.

"I have a LOT of shoes that desperately need organizing. I currently have some in two different closets, on the floor in my bedroom and shoved under the bed. Those that are under the bed are really hard to pull out and find the matching pair. So, I was really excited to try out this StorageManiac underbed shoe organizer. The organizer arrived folded up. If you need to fold it up to move or store it, you can easily fold it up again.The organizer is supposed to hold 12 shoes. However, I found that my gym shoes are a little large for it and work best with one shoe in each compartment. My flip flops, sandals and dress shoes (flats) all were able to fit one pair per slot. I wear size 9 shoes and they fit perfectly. My Husband's shoes (Men size 11-12) however, would not fit unless I slid them under the dividers. I am fine with that since it means that I don't have to share the storage space. I have plenty of shoes to fill it up.The organizer is a little loose in shape when you first unfold it. It does solidify more after you load it with shoes and zip it. I also love that it has a handle for pulling it out from under the bed or carrying it. I do wish that the top was clear so I could see what shoes were inside. I plan on storing my lesser used or out of season shoes in the organizer, so it isn't a big deal.

"I have thick, straight and oily hair. I used to avoid any products that had the word ""oil"" in them out of fear of slick, greasy hair. However, the hair industry has changed in the last few years and a lot of oil products are good for all hair types. I adore the Nexxus brand and normally love all of their shampoo and conditioners, so I decided to try this Nexxus Oil Infinite Conditioner.The conditioner has a light, sweet scent to it. I find it pleasant and it seems to fade after I am out of the shower. The conditioner got rid of the tangles and made my hair feel soft and great outside of the shower, but nothing special. Unfortunately, after a night of work it makes my hair slightly oily. It isn't too bad and I can and will continue to use the conditioner, but it is nothing special. As a side note, I later received the Nexxus Oil Infinite Shampoo and when I pair the two together my hair gets SUPER greasy and oily. I think the conditioner on its own is less of an issue since I don't apply it to the roots.

"I typically buy the Glad garbage bags that stretch, but I was happy to review another brand. The first thing that I noticed when this box arrived was that it was rather large and heavy for 45 garbage bags. It also currently has a lot of box tops for education on them which is nice. If you don't collect those, save them for someone who does. Our education system can use all the help it can get. Anyways, there were several things that stood out to me when I opened the box and viewed the bags. The apple scent is FAINT. It definitely is not enough to stand up to the stench of my cats and their litter. This is a shame since the odor block was one of the selling features for me. Then again, my regular garbage bags do not stand up to their stench either. These bags are also NOT the stretch bags. They are still pretty sturdy and did not rip on me. I do love that the bags have the good, strong tie handles.Overall, these are good garbage bags. Do they block all the odor? No. Do they break? Not easily. Would I buy them again? Probably.

"I have recently started using ""gel creams"" more often for moisturizing because they go on easily and they don't feel heavy on your skin. I am typically a fan of AHAVA products.

It makes my skin feel greasy and I have a hard time not washing it off. I will probably use the rest of the container for my feet or elbows where I don't mind the heavy and greasy feeling as much. I have tried it on my elbows and I do like the cream there. So, all is not lost.I will say that I am super picky about moisturizers and I hate the feel of heavy creams on my face. Other people may love this product. It depends on your preference and for that reason I am giving this 3 stars and not less. If you like heavy moisturizers, you will probably love this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DBC35GZYMZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQKPC8W#wasThisHelpful","R2DBC35GZYMZ7","A39WWMBA0299ZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39WWMBA0299ZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am one of those people that hate the feel of lotion or creams, particularly when they are greasy. As I have gotten older, moisturizing has become a necessity. I am happy to report that I really love this cream. It only requires a small amount to moisturize your hands. There is a faint, sweet smell. It is light and doesn't linger.The cream is thick, but it doesn't feel heavy going on your hands. It leaves my hands feeling soft and silky. Witch Hazel is really good for your skin too. I use it as a moisturizing toner on my face. So, I am hoping it will help my hands to stay young looking. I have also been putting this on my feel here and there because they have been super dry and it is heavenly. I definitely recommend this cream!

"EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE! What is better than comfy socks? Comfy Doctor Who socks!! I am a Whovian and I was so excited to receive these socks. They came looking just like the picture and I was thrilled that they were also soft and comfortable. I live in Florida and I like my socks to be minimal (low cut or ankle socks and thin), but still sturdy and comfortable. These socks are all of these things I love the colors. I have worn the blue and orange a few times. The grey have been neglected because they aren't as bright...but I will get to them too. They are slightly big on me because the black ankle part is up on my heel. However, they feel like they fit perfect. The huge dalek print is amazing.

"My Husband has always wanted a coffee grinder. So, we were both happy to receive this. We have been using K-cups for a few years now and we were getting fed up with the ridiculous prices. So, we purchased some refillable cups  and this grinder and we are now drinking freshly ground coffee from our Keurig. It tastes so much better when it is freshly ground!This Coffee Land Manual Coffee Grinder allows you to adjust how fine the grind is. You do have to work for your coffee, but it isn't that much effort and is worth the better taste. The grinder is easy to use with the large handle on the lid. The container that your ground coffee drops in to is glass. So, it will keep the ground coffee fresh and won't contaminate it from one brand to the next.

"This is my second ZAQ diffuser and my 5th diffuser overall. Honestly, ZAQ makes a far superior product to the other companies that I have tried. This diffuser is not only nice looking, it is well made and highly effective.To fill the diffuser, you simply lift off the top half of the pyramid, fill the plastic container that is included up with water, pour the water in, place a few drops of essential oil (3-5 is recommended, but I do 6-10), replace the top and press a button. It cycles through several different colors. If you find a color you like, press the button again to stop it on that color. Or, you could press the button a third time to turn off the colors while still diffusing. If you press the button four times, it turns off the machine.This ZAQ Noor diffuser has a very powerful stream of air that comes out the top. I placed lemon essential oil in it and my entire living room and kitchen was smelling amazing in a few minutes. I also love the price of this diffuser. At less than $40, it is definitely one of the better ones on the market for this price.

"We own about two dozen dart guns, so we are always excited to try the latest and greatest. If you are a huge fan of mods, this is definitely the dart gun for you. It comes with a few pieces, but if you really want to mod it out you will have to buy mod packs that cost $11.99-34.99 each (there are four of them designed for this gun...but you can use parts from other guns or other mods too). If you buy all the mods, there are supposedly over one thousand combinations.Anyways, this is a good gun. I don't love that it is battery powered. I do like that it has a banana clip and shoots fast and pretty accurate. I wish the banana clip could hold more darts. It only holds 10. Of course, you can replace it with clips from other guns or even buy a larger clip for it. One of the mods is a flip clip.Overall, this is a good gun. It just isn't my favorite. Honestly, most of the mods are not necessary. It is more of a ""cool"" factor than anything. If you want an awesome new gun for dart battles, I would recommend the new Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator Blaster which I also ordered and love a lot more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XUPUGJQIL6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDP7KKQ#wasThisHelpful","R37XUPUGJQIL6E","A39WWMBA0299ZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39WWMBA0299ZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Groom Industries Perky Fur Broom sweeps up dirt, fur and dust easily. I was impressed with just how much of the dirt in collected into a pile on our floor. I think it actually does a better job than our regular straw broom. I did have two problems with it however.1- Assembly. It comes in four different pieces. The broom handles are supposed to just connect easily by pushing them together. I thought I had assembled it fully until I tried to use it and the handle was bending and coming apart. My Husband asked to see it and pushed the handle together the rest of the way. For reference, there should not be any white showing in between the joints. If there is, keep pushing them together. It technically only takes seconds to assemble, but it does require a lot of strength. I couldn't do it on my own.2- It's hard to actually get the dirt pile off the floor using this. I tried to use this broom with a dustpan I have and it didn't work out very well because of the width of the broom. In the end, I ended up using my old straw broom with the dustpan to get the rest of it up.Overall, I like this rubber broom and I will continue to use it especially to collect the pet fur and dirt off of my floors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EKMFOKX6S268/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQNI99O#wasThisHelpful","R2EKMFOKX6S268","A39WWMBA0299ZF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39WWMBA0299ZF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these Stoon Bluetooth earbuds to use at work. I have a desk job with other people nearby that involves a lot of getting up, walking around and answering phones. So, I wanted to be able to listen to music to where only I could hear it, still hear the phone and my coworkers and be able to walk around at the same time. It sounds like a lot to ask for, but these earbuds allow me to do it.Pros:-No dangling wires-You can add a second earbud with the included attachments if you want a set of earbuds. I only need one.-Clear sound via Bluetooth-No skipping when walking aroundCons:-The earbud is shaped awkwardly. It isn't really uncomfortable, but I feel as though it is going to fall out (even though it doesn't).-The accessories are easy to lose. The earbud itself is even easy to lose.Overall, this is a nice earbud. It is definitely a great deal for the price.

"SUMMER JOB is one of those one-and-a-half star five star movies that's so bad it's good. Yeah, the script was written on a cocktail napkin , the editing is deplorably choppy, the acting is uneven, and most of the humor hits its marks only at unintended moments, but SUMMER JOB is the type of film that nobody makes anymore --- a low-budget T & A comedy --- that is fun simply because it is utterly mindless. Pop open a cold one and roll your eyes a lot. The soundtrack of the film is a tour de force of a band called OrKestra. Never heard of them? Neither did anyone else. The pretty girls and pretty boys of SUMMER JOB spend most of their time leering at each other, and almost all the bikini tops in this movie have a far-less-than-deplorable tendency to surrender to gravity. I say ""almost all"" because the stunningly statuesque ""Mystery Woman"" of SUMMER JOB succeeds in keeping the mystery intact while playing a double role. Although most of the young actors and actresses of SUMMER JOB remained unknowns, Sherrie Rose moved on to acting, scriptwriting and production, and Amy Lynn Baxter gained fifteen minutes of notoriety (that's seven-and-a-half minutes per boob) on the Howard Stern Show.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LA04QXF1Z52H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6301366271#wasThisHelpful","R3LA04QXF1Z52H","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"According to the biographies, Morgan Llywelyn was born in New York (or Ireland)(or possibly on-board ship sailing between the two). In any event, she is thoroughly Irish (or Irish-American)(or as Welsh as her name). Her love of history came early, when her mother encouraged her to explore her Llywelyn roots. This exploration made her a modern reinterpreter of the old Celtic legends which she presents in the form of novels. Prolific, she has written more than a score of books in that many years.Given the length of most of her works, her imagination is clearly protean. The quality of her output is unsurprisingly uneven, to be objectively critical. You can't have a winner every time, especially at that pace. I've liked many of her books, but disliked others.In ""The Horse Goddess"" we meet the ancient Celts of the Iron Age Hallstatt Era. In ""Druids"" we are witness to the downfall of the Gauls in the face of Roman imperialism. In ""Bard: The Odyssey of the Irish"" we view an unspoiled Ireland first being colonized by the Celtiberians. In ""Red Branch"" we are presented with a readable retelling of the Ulster Cycle legends.""1972"" is a continuation of Llywelyn's ""Irish Century"" series of books. The story opens in the early 1950s, and focuses primarily on the growth and maturation of Ursula ""Precious"" Halloran's son, Barry (or to give him his birth name, Finbar).  The identity of Barry's father is uncertain. Ursula, the young Irish Republican firebrand  of ""1916,"" ""1921,"" and ""1949"" is still shocking people with her unconventional and independent lifestyle, but she has more and more retreated into obscurity on the family's farm in County Clare. Ireland of the 1950s and 1960s has become an almost pathologically repressive society in which women most definitely hold second class citizenship. Ursula is doing all she can to teach Barry to disrespect such repressive norms. Like his mother, Barry eventually becomes a journalist, though he chooses photography rather than radio as his medium.Morgan Llywelyn places Barry and his camera (by contrivance, deus ex machina, and plot device after plot device) at the scene of every major domestic political incident in Ireland of the era, including the ""Bloody Sunday"" of 1972 (which began as a peace march). Unfortunately, once Barry reaches young adulthood, Llywelyn all but ignores plot, color, and character development in favor of straight historical reportage (thus the Three Stars of this review).As the ""story"" progresses toward its eponymous climactic year,  Barry the character fades, becoming little more than an authorial conceit. ""1972"" begins to read like a textbook on modern Irish history, or perhaps Llywelyn's own memoir of the time. And although she is scrupulous in documenting incidents (to the extent of footnoting) ""1972"" has a decidedly partisan feel.Llywelyn  is a staunch Irish Republican of the old school, for whom Padraig Pearse is the ideal man. She so strongly abhors and abjures the meaningless and ego-driven violence that engulfs the north of Ireland in the early 1970s, but she never really seems to grasp the deeper Whys? and Wherefores? of it. Llywelyn tends to place the blame for the violence on self-serving individuals (on both sides of the line) but doesn't really delve into why those people became self-serving or why they attracted followers. She recites the history, but does not analyze it (a necessity in the best historical fiction).An advocate of peace, and an advocate of a liberal and diverse Ireland, the goals she espouses are admirable, and almost utopian, but within the scope of the world as it existed in ""1972"" they remain utterly unachievable.They remain barely achievable today.By mildly fictionalizing history, Llywelyn allows us to get inside the troubled history of Ireland, north and south. Take advantage of the endnotes to delve deeper---many of the characters' quotes are their actual words, either spoken or written.This is the fourth volume in what became Morgan Llywelyn's ""Irish Century"" series which consists of  ""1916,"" ""1921,""  ""1949"", ""1972,"" and ""1999: A Novel of the Celtic Tiger and the Search for Peace,"" all critical turning points in modern Ireland's history, and all seen through the eyes of the Halloran family","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2BV6IH2ID7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312878575#wasThisHelpful","R3L2BV6IH2ID7Y","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The reality of Vietnam is that the only time to have unraveled its tangled skein was in 1945, when Ho Chi Minh, then a young nationalist leader of the Viet Minh movement, wrote to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, asking him to use his influence with the French to establish autonomous states within the French Union (France's version of the Commonwealth of Nations) in what had been wartime Japanese-occupied French Indochina.Unfortunately for history, for Vietnam, and for the United States, FDR died before he could address Ho's correspondence, and Harry S Truman ignored it in favor of supporting the U.S.'s wartime ally. Had FDR lived (which he did not) and had he taken up Ho's cause (which he may well have either singly or through the mechanisms of the new United Nations), and had he influenced the French positively (a remote possibility), then Vietnam would have been what America always pretended it was, a bulwark against Communist expansion.Ignored by America, Ho turned to the Soviet Union (as, later, did Fidel Castro). It is perhaps one of the greatest failings of American postwar foreign policy that American planners saw the Second World as entirely monolithic and conflated Marxism with Stalinism.  Had the State Department not been so ossified, it is quite likely that non-Communist though truly democratic Marxist nation-states might have helped to bring down the inflexible, often dangerous, willfully blind U.S.S.R. by exporting their own brand of democracy through the Third World.By the time David Halberstam reached South Vietnam in 1961, the die was cast. Rather than supporting the goals of the Viet Minh, the United States had demonized it, supported the old French imperial structure, and had pushed the Viet Minh into the outstretched claws of the Insatiable Red Beast. In some ways, this mistake was understandable. Picking up the fallen banner of the West after the 1954 French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, the United States (which had just fought against Communist aggression in Korea) made the mistake of equating Vietnam with Korea --- as at first glance they seemed equivalent as two east Asian nations divided artificially at parallels, North and South, Communist and Free World. This view led to an unnecessary military buildup along the 17th Parallel.However, aside from the superficial similarities described, Korea and Vietnam could not have been more different.The war in Vietnam was an insurgency, with fighting not along the borders but throughout the territory of the propped-up southern republic. The Communists of Vietnam were not the conquerors of the country, they were the patriots who had won the war against the French. And there were as many patriots in the South as there were in the North. Thus, even those who disliked the Communist model were of two minds about fighting the Viet Cong.Making a confused situation far worse was the fact that the government of the South was not a government at all; from 1955 to 1963, South Vietnam was a family dictatorship under the Ngo clan, managed by fiat and by whim. The Ngo family was Catholic, drawn from the French-dominated upper-class, while most of the country was Buddhist. Under the Ngo clan, only Catholics rose to prominence. Personal loyalty to the clan rated above loyalty to the country. Competent administrators and military commanders who told the Ngos what they did not want to hear were usually subject to marginalization, sometimes exile, sometimes arrest, and occasionally death. President Ngo Dinh Diem was a Mandarin --- isolated, autocratic, singularly moral, but closed off from the people.Diem's large extended family, particularly his power-intoxicated brother Ngo Dinh Nhu and Nhu's frightening wife, the histrionic Madame Nhu, maintained their status by displays of Fascist pomp. They depended upon American support, publicly denounced the United States, and actively confounded all American plans for land reform, defense, and social programming. Cheerfully ignoring the advice of American political and military figures in regard to sustaining the country, they were responsible for their own downfall.Ngo leadership of South Vietnam was focused only upon maintaining Ngo power, while the Second World plan for the entire country was touted by its proponents, the Viet Cong, as better organized and more humane than the chaos which was the First World plan. That the Communists later became brutal and repressive in turn was almost inevitable, but in the early 1960s, they seemed to hold out hope for a stable society.U.S. leaders in South Vietnam were convinced against all logic that they could control and direct the Ngos despite every indication to the contrary. Sadly, having painted the United States into a corner by backing a cadre of tin-pot dictators, American advisors hypnotized themselves with their own hyperbole, suppressed reports of failures, and became pathologically optimistic about South Vietnam's chances to be self-sustaining, even as the thatch caved in and the walls of the house that was South Vietnam came down. Halberstam claims that only the journalists saw the full picture at the time, and he is probably right.In part, this policy of pathological optimism was a reaction to concurrent events such as President Kennedy's dismal handling of the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba, his humiliation by Khruschev at Vienna, the rise of the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban Missile Crisis.Admissions of failure in American foreign policy simply were not a viable choice in 1962-63, and so most Americans in Vietnam ignored the rabid elephant in the room, telling Washington what they wanted Washington to hear --- happy talk.Had Kennedy lived, it's possible that the American mission in Vietnam might have ended quietly in 1965 or 1966; but his death promoted Lyndon Baines Johnson to chair in the Oval Office.Johnson was the man who described Diem as ""the Winston Churchill of Asia,"" a comment which speaks volumes about the American capacity for self-delusion. Johnson wanted to fight a war, and did, much to the detriment of the nation he led.Diem was gone by the time LBJ rose to power. Halberstam describes the last few months of the Diem regime as ""a government committing suicide.""  A popular protest led by Buddhist monks finally challenged Ngo power. Halberstam reports on the ""Buddhist Crisis"" but it's clear that he neither understands the Buddhists nor their motivations. Several monks immolated themselves, acts of sacrifice which galvanized the population. Madame Nhu, for her part, ""clapped her hands"" and made public statements alluding to the ""barbecues."" South Vietnam was ripe for a coup, and a coup occurred, ending in Diem's and Nhu's deaths. Madame Nhu fled to Europe.Having let South Vietnam kill itself, the United States was not satisfied to let the corpse rest, but tragically and pointlessly kept trying to reanimate it by assuming the leading role in a war only a minority of Vietnamese wished to fight. The 56,000 Americans (and millions of Vietnamese) who died in this most unnatural of wars still have no living legacy.One can criticize Halberstam's ""know everything"" tone, and hindsight is always 20/20, but for anyone interested in understanding how America got drawn into an endless war, THE MAKING OF A QUAGMIRE is an essential read, especially in these days of the War Without End on Terror.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SKW1RC2OY4QL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0742560082#wasThisHelpful","R3SKW1RC2OY4QL","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harold Holzer's LINCOLN PRESIDENT-ELECT shines a light on a rarely-studied period of American history, that of what Holzer calls a little inaccurately the ""interregnum"" between the Presidential election of November 1860 and the inauguration of  Lincoln as President in March 1861.Yet, in another sense, ""interregnum,"" the period between royal reigns, is the perfect term. Lincoln's predecessor, the doughface James Buchanan was not simply a lame duck President, he was an abysmally failed leader who did absolutely nothing as the Union convulsed and a coterie of men created the Confederate States of America, a doppleganger of a nation the purposes of which were never clear even in its day.Lincoln, or the spectre of Lincoln, was the proximate cause of the convulsion. In 1820, the Missouri Compromise was passed between the pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in the United States Congress, involving primarily the regulation of slavery in the western territories. It prohibited slavery in the former Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36∞30‚Ä≤ north except within the boundaries of the proposed State of Missouri. To balance the number of ""Slave States"" and ""Free States,"" the northern region of what was then Massachusetts was admitted into the United States as a Free State to become Maine. Thomas Jefferson prophesied that the division of the country created by the Compromise Line would eventually lead to the destruction of the Union:""...but this momentous question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. It is hushed indeed for the moment. But this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence. A geographical line, coinciding with a marked principle, moral and political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated; and every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper.""And so it happened. The election of Lincoln, the first Republican President, and a perceived abolitionist, was the mark that tore the national fabric. It is important to note that Lincoln was NOT an abolitionist in 1860; at most, he wanted to restrict the expansion of slavery into new U.S. Territories. Yet despite this oft-repeated position, the South (and pro-slavery Northerners, of whom there were more than a few) refused to heed the President-Elect's words, focusing instead on their fears.No President has been hated more than Abraham Lincoln, who was derided as ""an ape"" and worse, even before he announced his candidacy. Almost as soon as he was elected (and long before he was inaugurated) the Southern States began to secede. That this was the desire of a few fire-eating Southerners who sought power and influence in a new political entity is abundantly clear. That they took the mass of the citizenry living south of the Mason-Dixon Line with them by baldfaced manipulation of the facts is also clear. Many people distrusted the secessionists; a noted Virginian referred in December 1860 to lone seceded South Carolina as ""that impudent little vixen.""Lincoln has long been criticized for doing nothing and saying nothing during the four month long ""Secession Winter."" In truth, Holzer shows us that Lincoln picked his words with extraordinary care during the interregnum, choosing most often to say nothing since nothing was truly the best thing to say. Without authority, any word of Lincoln's could worsen the crisis, and even in the earliest weeks of his pre-Presidency Lincoln feared losing the Border States. He also wanted, if he could, to calm the fears of the States of the Upper South. That hysteria overtook his attempts at pouring oil on troubled waters was perhaps an inevitability.Instead of speaking publicly, Lincoln spoke privately --- to visiting politicians and national leaders in closed-door meetings, and to thousands upon thousands of ordinary citizens seeking Federal patronage jobs, people he met with individually. Among them were folk from the Deep South who'd come to see ""the monster"" and went away feeling that the President-Elect was a man uniquely suited for the task ahead. Other reviewers criticize Holzer for not sufficiently documenting these meetings, open and closed, but the 19th Century was unlike the 21st --- there was less mania to record a person's every act.For a politician, Lincoln made very few missteps. No, he didn't speak out often, but perhaps that was better, as he apparently himself believed. No matter what he said, his words were used as wedges by the highly politicized Press of the day. Often the same phrases evoked violently disparate reactions in editors and readers depending on Party and Section, and day of the week. Speaking less under such circumstances was probably wiser, as it allowed him to focus more on creating his Presidency and less on defending it.When Lincoln did speak publicly, his preplanned speeches rang with authenticity, but his off the cuff remarks were sometimes sloppy.  Still, only occasionally did he misstep, and once only with clearly damaging consequences, when he allowed himself to be smuggled through pro-secesh Baltimore in the face of a threat of assassination. Coming immediately before his arrival in Washington, it gave the appearance of skulking into the capital; at the same time, Holzer provides enough, if not conclusive, evidence that Lincoln did evade an assassin.Holzer does not spend a great deal of time discussing in a general, historical sense, the slow implosion of the Union in these four months. How the implosion impacted Lincoln in the broadest sense is skimped, and whether the President-Elect had to radically shift his views, or how much, between November and March Holzer seems to overlook. The focus of the book is on the man and only secondarily on policy, an oversight that seems invisible while reading the book but glaring in retrospect and costs it a star. Otherwise, this is a readable, enjoyable, and very necessary addition to the vast library written on the Civil War.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ARB748811STC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FA0I6K#wasThisHelpful","R1ARB748811STC","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Norman Jewison's dystopian parable of a world rendered complacent is a far better commentary on evolving social mores than it is a science fiction film. In fact, ROLLERBALL (1975) is less scientific than merely futuristic.The world of ROLLERBALL was supposed to look futuristic compared to contemporary 1975, but the stage settings now look bizarrely ""mod"" and retro in 2013 (look at the computer-printer fonts, for example). Our 2013 society has both stepped back away from and toward the ROLLERBALL world, with our current strange societal mix of religious fanaticism and corporate greed. It's likely, however, that many people would mindlessly and happily submit to a world where their whims would be sated while their thoughts would be strangled.After as period of political unrest which has done away with national governments and after a world war of sorts in which individual corporations have merged into huge conglomerates, in the year 2018 the world is run efficiently and effectively by an oligarchy of seven corporate CEOs representing basic human needs such as Food, Health, Energy, and Luxury. It is a post-capitalist world in which, as Mr. Bartholomew (John Houseman) the CEO of Energy, explains, ""You can have anything you wish for at the price of not questioning our decisions."" And so, war, crime, sickness and poverty have been eliminated at the cost of even modest dissent.The aggressive urge in humans has been sublimated into a spectator sport known as Rollerball, a violent admixture of motorcross and roller derby, the aim of which is to deposit a steel baseball-sized orb into a goal receptacle. There are few rules, the players are only lightly padded, and most Rollerball players have very short professional careers.Jonathan E. (James Caan) however, is a Rollerball legend. Having played for the world champion Houston team for ten years, he is the holder of most Rollerball records (including most opposing players killed on the track). He is relatively unsophisticated, but he has begun to dislike the ruling oligarchy for purely personal reasons---one of the Corporate moguls has appropriated his wife.Women, as a rule, do not fare well in the future world of Rollerball. Most of them are assigned as concubines for set periods of time, and, obviously, even wives are subject to the whims of the corporate structure. Men are subject to those whims in other ways. Not robotized but rather hypnotized, the people in ROLLERBALL are all consistently well-dressed, healthy, prosperous and utterly compliant with directives from the faceless leadership. The world of ROLLERBALL is a Wall Street Bull Market stockbroker's erotic fantasy.Although Jonathan is a superstar, and although he is supplied with literally every thing a man could want, and though he is promised even more for his acquiescence, he balks when he is told to retire. While never actually refusing to quit, he continues to play in each game, and his defiance enrages the oligarchy, who punish him by eliminating most of what few Rollerball rules there are, hoping he will be killed in a game.Mr. Bartholomew explains, ""The point of the game is to demonstrate the futility of individual effort,"" but as the oligarchy clamps down on him, progressively withdrawing its largesse, Jonathan E. finds himself struggling with real, individual, thoughts (at one point he visits a library to discover that books have been replaced with approved Corporately-produced electronic synopses), and the shaping of his own personal goals (he tries to reestablish a relationship with his wife, who has another family and other commitments).The last Rollerball game ends with Jonathan, having survived a bloodbath on the flaming track, taking a victory lap to the chanting of enthralled fans.Far more frightening now than when it was made, ROLLERBALL has an eerie applicability to present-day undereducated, reality TV-drugged American life. Some lessons from history have been tragically lost since the mid-late 20th Century. In 1975, audiences having just passed through the Watergate scandal, were bound to be horrified at the controlled Gray Flannel Suit world of ROLLERBALL. But for a modern audience, ROLLERBALL's material-success-without-effort universe is likely to be far more attractive. And that, in itself, is a reason to take this film seriously.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R8SG3CA6ZUX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0792838300#wasThisHelpful","R3R8SG3CA6ZUX8","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jeffrey K. Mann is a Doctor of Religious Studies who has spent much time studying the Japanese martial arts. He has also investigated Zen practice and the history of Zen, and WHEN BUDDHISTS ATTACK (an intriguing title) is subtitled THE CURIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ZEN AND THE MARTIAL ARTS. (I suppose WHEN ZENJI ATTACK would have been too esoteric a title.)WHEN BUDDHISTS ATTACK put me in mind of the many pop-culture references to Zen and to martial arts that have (for better or worse) permeated Western culture. Does anyone really think that feeding their dog ZEN PUPPY DOG TREATS is going to make the dog more mindful? I was reminded of Mr. Miyagi's response when Daniel-San asked, ""I always thought karate came from Buddhist temples and stuff"" in The Karate Kid: ""You too much TV.""Regardless of the fact that a cookbook entitled THE ZEN OF ITALIAN FOOD is in print, the complex interrelationship between Zen and the martial arts deserves responsible investigation. After all, the Buddha himself was of the Hindu Kshatriya Warrior Caste. Mann spends a little too much time in the early pages of the book recounting the legends surrounding the Buddha's birth and life. As an ordained senior Zen student, I have yet to meet a Zen teacher, Oriental or Occidental, who accepts the story of the Buddha's life literally in the same sense that many Christians accept the canonical gospels as providing the facts of Jesus' life.Very little is known about the Buddha, actually, beyond the bare facts that he was born, lived, preached, and died approximately 2600 years ago. Tradition provides a smattering of place names for these occurrences, and many scholars believe that some of the Buddha's actual words were preserved in The Dhammapada, but by the time the Buddha's story was committed to paper centuries had passed since his death. Thus, the teachings became overlaid with a sediment of interpretation and cultural assimilation as Buddhism spread out of India and across east Asia.Buddhism was traditionally brought out of India to China by a man named Bodhidharma, otherwise known as ""The Blue Eyed Monk."" Janet Jiryu Abels in Making Zen Your Own: Giving Life to Twelve Key Golden Age Ancestors, describes in some detail that Bodhidharma was the gifted son of a local king in southern India. Mann claims he was Persian. In a book full of footnotes and a glossary of foreign terms, Mann fails to footnote this factoid, which flies in the face of conventional information. I'm intensely curious to know where Mann found that out.Be that as it may, Mann (along with everyone else who has written about Bodhidharma) consigns most of the ""known facts"" about the 26th Indian Patriarch/1st Chinese Patriarch of Zen to the Legend category, including Bodhidharma's introduction of green tea to China, and especially Bodhidharma's invention or patronage of Chinese martial arts among the monks he taught. Whatever the true source, there was some intermingling of martial arts with Zen (or Ch'an) in China, even in the earliest days, primarily because of the nature of Zen in China. Unlike India, where monks could wander freely as Dharma teachers year-round subsisting on begging for food, the Chinese climate encouraged at least the seasonal establishment of settled communities of monks. Structured opportunities to learn and/or perfect a skill early on became a feature of Zen training, whether that skill was unarmed combat, carpentry, agriculture, music, viniculture, cooking, or clearing the snow from the monastery path or chopping and carrying wood for the woodstoves. This emphasis on Zen-in-work was transmitted to the Japanese who aesthetically perfected it as Bonsai culture, Ikebana, the Tea Ceremony, archery, calligraphy and gardening. To be sure, these activities themselves are not Zen, but the manner in which the participant carries them out may be.Mann posits that Zen was heavily influenced by Confucian virtue ethics, and this is true in an overarching cultural sense. Zen Koans are direct outgrowths of Confucian legal holdings and are in fact called ""cases."" But scholars are more and more convinced that Zen grew out of a synthesis between Taoists (who were rejecting the rigid hierarchical structure of Confucian thought in favor of a more organic view of life and human society) and Chinese Buddhists whose own roots were those of the openminded Buddha, a man who had rejected caste in his teachings.Mann is at his best when describing the attraction Zen held for the Japanese Samurai. Quite a number of aging Samurai shaved their heads and donned the robe toward the ends of their lives in order to seek perhaps an inner peace that eluded them as warriors. Indeed, a philosophy that trains the mind to focus on life's immediacy in this moment, would be very attractive to a class of men whose life's task was to die at any moment in the service of their masters. Even today, it is not unexpected for a Zen student to write a haiku to be shared with the Sangha on an auspicious occasion much as Samurai did, particularly before their deaths; likewise, certain Zen rituals practiced today are heavily marked by the Samurai influence: In the ritual known as Shuso Hossen or Dharma Combat, the student to be challenged is given a symbolic sword which has a role in the ceremony. But it is not expected that Zen students must adopt a martial art as part of their ongoing Zen inquiry. Neither is it expected that a student of Budo adopt Zen practice as part of their training. The two approaches do not rely on each other, though, for individuals, they may compliment each other.This warrior legacy seems strange for a philosophy/religion that teaches ahimsa. The word ""nonviolence"" is often used to translate ahimsa, but ahimsa is more than just the (negative) absence of violence, it is the (positive) propagation of compassionate action. Most Buddhists (even the Samurai in their day) practice ahimsa to a greater or lesser extent. Very few people become identified with ahimsa, however, (the Dalai Lama and Mahatma Gandhi being the two most famous), largely because ahimsa is not a behavior that can be enforced (the very word ""enforced"" is antithetical to ahimsa). Hence, most Buddhist teachers promote compassion-in-action in the hope that the evolving student will find his or her way to ahimsa. Warrior monks such as Takuan and Taisen Deshimaru are illustrative of this mixed legacy.I had a great inner debate while reading Mann's chapter on ""Zen, Budo, and Ethics."" Although through much of the book Mann maintains that Zen and Budo are cousins, in this particular chapter they become kissing (or more accurately, killing) cousins. Mann makes this error, in part, because he relies too heavily on the writings of D.T. Suzuki, to whom everything Japanese was Zen. (In truth, there are a number of Buddhist sects in Japan, of which Zen is the smallest; and there is Shinto.) D.T. Suzuki, it must be pointed out, was a lay student of Soyen Shaku, the first Japanese Zen Master to visit America in 1893. Suzuki was never ordained by Shaku, and D.T. Suzuki's writings are, if relatively gifted, almost exclusively primed for the Western intellect. Trying to understand Zen by reading D.T. Suzuki is like trying to taste the dinner by eating the fork.Mann also errs in misunderstanding Zen only ""as a special transmission *outside the scriptures* (emphasis his)"" saying further that ""Zen itself is prone to considerable ethical liberty,"" and stating, ""Admittedly, Rinzai Zen places more emphasis on no-self than the precepts.""Really? ""Admittedly?"" Who admits? I have never yet met a Zen teacher, Denkai, Sensei or Roshi, that has relegated the Zen Precepts to a secondary or even tertiary place. If anything, the teachers I have been exposed to, either in person or through study, have uniformly and universally treated the precepts as preeminent in Zen practice. The Precepts are the pathways to actualizing The Eightfold Path and recognizing the Four Noble Truths. Zazen and Koan practice are the tools a Zen student uses to understand the Precepts.That there are Zen teachers (and Mann quotes several) who disavow the Precepts is not a reflection on Zen, it is a reflection on those teachers, who, titled or not, did not embody the Precepts in their own lives, and thus mutated Zen into something else. D.T. Suzuki's quote: ""When your mind functions with nature...you are not responsible for whatever deeds you commit, and consequently no course of karma is attached to them...who blames the wind when it leaves havoc in its wake?"" is philosophical garbage. When Mankind acts according to its *true nature* (as understood in Buddhism), such acts create karma (regardless of Suzuki's comment), and those acts do *not* create havoc. A man is expected to be a man and act like one. A man is not a breeze.Likewise, a quoted comment by Omori Sogen Roshi, a Japanese nationalist of World War II, says more about the Roshi than it does about Zen: ""...one [who] forgets his biological origins and characteristics...[forgets] the current reality: 'Eat or be eaten!'...[these are] the great lessons...from Budo."" Omori Sogen is a man who may be wearing the robe and bearing the title, but he is a racist and a killer who has lost himself in the very duality and delusion the Buddha preached must be overcome.Although I disagree with Mann that these teachings constitute a kind of Dark Side to Zen, it is helpful to have them as reference points, if for no other reason than to highlight what Zen is not. At least it allowed me to engage with this book in a way I might otherwise not have. Hence, I've given WHEN BUDDHISTS ATTACK five stars even though I believe that Mann's grasp of Zen is far less thorough than his grasp of Budo.So, Zen and Budo? It is, it isn't, it's both and it's neither.In the end, the thesis of Mann's fine book can be summed up by the Buddha's words from the Parinirvana Sutra:""Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations.

"Peter Matthiessen is one part artist, one part anthropologist, and one spiritual seeker. Many of his non-fiction books (among them The Snow Leopard, Men's Lives, and The Tree Where Man Was Born chronicle the history and lament the slow passing of indigenous cultures along with the loss of the natural environment which sustained them.Matthiessen has a particular attachment to the Native American cultures. I will use his term ""Indians"" for these peoples, derived not from ""India"" he surmises, but perhaps from Columbus' description of them: ""Una gente in Dios,"" ""A people of God."" (Columbus, the Portuguese-born Spanish explorer from Genoa, wrote in an interesting amalgam of his three tongues.)In the 520 years since 1492, when Euro-Americans first met the Indians, the Indians have been decimated (a European-borne plague around 1500, moving faster than European settlement, is estimated to have killed 90% of the Indian population in the Americas) and decimated again as Euro-Americans moved westward, either by disease intentionally and unintentionally spread, and a genocidal war never formally declared but culturally defined. They were decimated yet again as they were forcibly removed from their homelands and placed on government-sanctioned ""reservations"" (often far removed from their aboriginal homelands) where the remnants of their native culture were shattered by the forcible imposition of Christianity, the English language, consumer capitalism, and poverty.All of America is ""Indian Country."" A quick look at a map gives us States with names like Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, not one but two Dakotas, among others, and an ""Indiana."" A closer look, and we'll find Massapequa, Miami, and Mishawaka as just three ""Ms"" among thousands of locations with Indian place names. Given this profusion of names, a casual historian might assume that we honor our Indian forebears, but nothing could be further from the truth. Several reviewers have not inaccurately declared INDIAN COUNTRY to be a companion volume to Dee Brown's excellent retrospective Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee, which recounted the miserable history of Euro-American/Native American interactions in the 19th Century.Peter Matthiessen turns his considerable journalistic and storytelling skills toward the 20th Century, illustrating for us that that miserable history has continued, albeit without bloodlettings like the Sand Creek Massacre. Through a series of independent reportages at a dozen widely-separated places around the nation, Matthiessen compels us to recognize that the slow destruction of the American Indian continues.It is no great mystery that the manner in which Euro-Americans and Indians view the world is widely and often wildly disparate. Matthiessen holds that the original European settlers were terrified of the wilderness and so they set out to conquer it by indiscriminate land-clearing, by imposing a rectangular national grid over a nonlinear map, and by ridding themselves of a race of folk who saw themselves not as ""owners"" of the earth but as ""stewards"" of it.To Indians, the untamed and unsettled wilderness was only ""The Place We Live Not,"" and a place of no fear. Instinctive ecologists, they took only as much as they needed from the earth, and ensured that it would remain fruitful for successive generations. The ""gente in Dios"" described by Columbus actually welcomed and aided the Europeans at first, before they were dispossessed, forced to watch the land they felt they were born from destroyed, and they were ultimately slain. It is little wonder that Matthiessen has difficulty speaking with some Indian leaders---he is, after all, just another White Man with an agenda. But in corner after corner of the continent, he is confronted with Indians facing the ongoing destruction of their remaining lands and their remnant cultures.In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. Government, with a fine disregard for niceties, had declared certain tribes ""terminated"" (an ugly term, meaning that the tribe was no longer recognized as a legal entity). As a result, lands were expropriated and Indians lost property and benefits rights. Termination continued to be an active policy until 1983, but of the 109 tribes so ""terminated"" only a few have since regained tribal status.At the time Matthiessen writes (circa 1985), the Mohawks of northern New York State are slowly being poisoned by effluvia from a GM foundry, an Alcoa plant and a Reynolds plant all surrounding their reservation. All three massive factories are dumping Dioxin and 2,4,5 -T into the Mohawks' watershed. Organized peaceful resistance nearly leads to an armed confrontation with New York State Troopers.At the same time, the Miccosukee Tribe of the Florida Everglades is facing displacement and destruction of the natural habitat, and loss of livelihood, by real estate developers' plans for the continued draining of the Everglades, west and east, in order to enable further building of planned communities in Boca Raton and in Naples, Florida.Matthiessen tells us of the Tellico Dam, a pork-barrel project of the Tennessee Valley Authority, meant to add three megawatts of generating power to the TVA's existing 27 thousand million megawatts, at the price of the destruction of the rare snail darter, a minnow then found only in the Little Tennessee River. The snail darter was rendered extinct in the destruction of the ""Little T"" and the flooding of its beautiful valley (this caused a worldwide outcry among ecologists, who were placated by the discovery of more snail darters elsewhere), but besides the snail darter, the archaeological sites of the Seven Cities of the Cherokee were destroyed, as was the Cherokees' ancestral holy ground.Matthiessen also discusses problems among the Indians themselves. Divided into numerous tribes, their competing interests sometimes block cooperation (a verbal but almost-violent range war develops between the Hopi and the Navajo over land use and riparian rights in arid Arizona).The differing views of different Indian groups even within the same tribe cause inertia, as ""Traditionals"" (who eschew even such modern conveniences as electricity and running water) argue with ""Tribalists"" (generally reservation-dwellers who maintain their Indian identity amongst the modernizing influences of the Whites) and ""Assimilationists"" (who often live off the reservations) about the direction their group should be taking.It is little wonder that Whites, even those better disposed toward Indians, gravitate toward those members of the community who have adopted Euro-American values. The letters Indian leaders have written to Washington politicians reflect a profound difference in values, as the Indians often speak to sentimental rationales for preservation, while Euro-Americans expect cold practical reasons for diverting themselves from short-term profits. The Tribal Councils that represent their people vis-a-vis the Bureau of Indian Affairs are often packed with handpicked BIA-vetted candidates. Groups that object to Council decisions are often effectively voiceless.Unfortunately, tribal inertia allows unethical and profit-driven corporatists to exploit Indian holdings, all in the name of progress. And if this was the case in 1985, it is no doubt still the case, and worse, in our increasingly profit-driven capitalist culture. (This is not an indictment of capitalism, merely an observation.) Euro-Americans have much to learn from the Indians, as Matthiessen points out so well. And now especially, in this time of climate change, fracking, and unrestrained greed.Ultimately, the Indians have a great deal to contribute to modern America. They need to do so by capturing the popular imagination, and by demonstrating that conservation and respect for the earth and equally powerful motivators as money. Until then, they will remain under attack, their tenuous hold on those fragments of America they still call their own always under threat, and their continued existence as a people or peoples an unsettled thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VCDHXP9CVFBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140130233#wasThisHelpful","R2VCDHXP9CVFBH","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hercule Poirot, the diminutive Belgian detective of Agatha Christie's imagining, is brilliantly brought to life by British actor David Suchet. Suchet, who was chosen for the role by the executors of Christie's estate, turns in a characterization that is now universally considered the non plus ultra of  all Poirots of the silver screen, large or small.Since 1989, Suchet has worked steadily to bring all the Poirot stories (33 novels, one play and 50 + short stories) to life, and by 2013 will have accomplished this impressive task.The earlier seasons are framed in the Art Deco 1930s, a period which is meticulously recreated onscreen. The series abounds with droll humor, generated largely by Poirot's insufferable self-esteem garnished with his freely flowing malapropisms. His foils include Captain Hastings, the Dr. John Watson of Poirot's universe, Chief Inspector Japp, the disheveled LeStrade, and Miss Lemon, Poirot's Obsessive-Compulsive secretary. Hastings tends to go off on tangents (frequently about motorcars), Japp is always three steps behind Poirot, and Miss Lemon keeps the office running smoothly, giving Poirot's ""little grey cells"" ample opportunity to unravel the Gordian Knots of cases that cross his desk.The show has a slower and more methodical pace than most American television, and the mysteries are more softboiled, with an absence of the lurid violence we've come to expect on TV. Anyone turning to POIROT for an adrenaline rush will be put to sleep. But if you enjoy low-key period mystery stories, this show simply cannot be surpassed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROFQMWIM2W85A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036H079S#wasThisHelpful","ROFQMWIM2W85A","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eugene B. Sledge, a young man from Mobile, Alabama later to be a Ph.D. college professor, joined the Marines right after Pearl Harbor, and soon found himself engaged, along with thousands of other Marines, in two of the most horrific battles of the Pacific War, first Peleliu, and then Okinawa.The decision to take Peleliu has been debated to this day. Originally considered to be a necessary operation to protect McArthur's flank during the retaking of the Philippines, the battle for Peleliu, begun in September 1944, raged for two months (not the expected four days), and by the time Japanese resistance was crushed in the Urumbrogol Pocket, the Philippine Campaign was well under way. 6,500 Marines were killed or wounded out of 17,500 men, and 3,300 men of the Army's 81st Infantry Division were killed or wounded out of 11,000. The 1st Marine Division (""The Old Breed"") was rendered hors de combat until April of 1945. These were the highest casualties to ratio of any Pacific battle.Almost all the 11,000 Japanese defenders died. 202 civilian Japanese workers were taken prisoner, and 27 Japanese troops remained in hiding, refusing to surrender until 1947.Professor Sledge, (he was euphoniously nicknamed ""Sledgehammer"" by his comrades, not for any especial toughness) was an ordinary Marine Private, trained as a mortarman, who found himself ashore on the vast coral rock that was Peleliu. Unlike previous Pacific battles where Japanese troops committed mass suicide while being cut down during insane banzai charges, the Peleliu defenders dug in and picked Marines off one at a time from the caves and rocky defiles of Peleliu's stony but convoluted surface.Professor Sledge wrote WITH THE OLD BREED as a personal reminiscence never intending it for publication, and as such it is an unpolished classic of World War Two literature. Sledge managed to retain an amazing amount of detail in his mind (with the aid of some scribbled notes), a task made even more amazing when a reader considers how emotionally and physically exhausted he had to have been in the midst of combat.A few reminiscences are amusing (he describes a hard-bitten World War I veteran who washed his ""equipment"" with an army brush), while others are nakedly sentimental (when he writes of the men he knew who died, it is with the obvious glitter of tears in his eyes), but for the most part, his reminiscences are simply, brutally, honest.WITH THE OLD BREED is an anti-war book, but not because Sledge has an ""agenda"". If anything, he honors ""The Old Breed"" highly for its storied history. Sledge does not speak of the glory battle or wave the flag. Instead, he tells us that a simple compliment from an experienced combat veteran meant more to him than any medal he could have won. He cannot say enough about the bravery and sacrifice of the men who fought and who were wounded and who died doing a necessary (if distasteful) task in a hellish place.I doubt there is anyone who can read WITH THE OLD BREED without being somehow changed.Sledge brings us right into the forefront of battle, where the stench of bloated, gaseous, and bursting corpses is in competition with the noisome exhalation of human excrement, the foul odor of discarded rotting rations, the coppery smell of drying blood, and the stink of cordite. Huge land crabs scuttle amongst the dead eating their eyes, and huge green bottle flies---so glutted they will not move---fester on wounds, and rise up from maggot-ridden torn dead flesh to infest the men's food supplies.The Marines trapped in the midst of this netherworld are reduced to eating nothing but cold fly-infested K rations and drinking oil-tainted water; they live for weeks on end covered in layers of coral dust baked shell-like by drenching rainstorms and prodigious heat over 100*. And they must contend with an implacable Japanese soldiery, given to committing atrocities indiscriminately upon the living and the dead. Sledge writes of the horrifyingly atavistic night sounds of Marines in foxholes engaged in grappling knife combat with Japanese infiltrators. He makes no bones about it. He hates his Japanese enemies and takes a grim satisfaction in their deaths.The Battle of Okinawa, while less otherworldly than Peleliu, was a battle fought upon Japanese home territory, and, if anything, the enemy was even more implacable there, having to be driven out of its redoubts man by man. Sledge tells us of the endless cacophony of Okinawa, of machine guns rattling endlessly, bombs dropping, shells bursting, men screaming in pain or fear or rage.Unlike blazing, rocky Peleliu, Okinawa was a world of mud and chill rains, a world where Marine progress was measured in feet per day, a world of death, where a man digging a foxhole might uncover a mud-buried corpse being greedily devoured by insects. Sledge tells of of his daily post overlooking a foxhole wherein a slain Marine's body, unable to be buried in the midst of the battle, slowly decomposed before his eyes, and how this ghastly sight has never left him.Of 183,000 Allied troops committed on Okinawa, over 84,000 were killed or wounded. Japanese losses were over 110,000 of 120,000, mostly killed.Somehow, amidst all the killing, Sledge (and most of his fellows) avoided going mad or being reduced to human wreckage. Sledge was not only one of the few of The Old Breed who survived both battles, he survived miraculously  unscathed physically. There is no question in Sledge's mind that the war he fought was a ""good war."" But he questions the human toll of any war.So would anyone who reads WITH THE OLD BREED. War may in fact be a necessary evil at times, but if it is, it must be the last of all possible options. Because, in the end, despite the banners and the speeches, only the flies benefit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RPFQLNQKF2QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0891419195#wasThisHelpful","R3RPFQLNQKF2QH","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone knows the name ""Rockefeller""; it is synonymous with wealth and power. Fewer know the name ""John D. Rockefeller,"" the nineteenth century paterfamilias of the clan, who rose from an obscure grain merchant to the head of the mightiest of American corporations, Standard Oil (today's Exxon Mobil). Even fewer know that although John D. Rockefeller was the public face of Standard Oil, Rockefeller had a partner who kept the books and managed the backroom deals, and may, in fact, have been more responsible for Standard Oil's financial success than Rockefeller himself. That man was named Henry Morison Flagler, and his name is hardly a household word, hardly even in South Florida where people have at least heard the name.By the time Flagler was fifty five, he was one of the wealthiest men in the world. He had a deserved reputation as a cutthroat robber baron, and had been investigated by Congress and denigrated in the press for his greed. Yet, at fifty five, the trajectory of Henry Flagler's life changed completely. In an attempt to ease his first wife's chronic asthma, he left his sprawling Westchester County (NY), estate, bizarrely called ""Satan's Toe,"" and came to St. Augustine, Florida, America's oldest city, where the perpetual summer of Florida eased her breathing. It was when Flagler saw his first palm tree that the stoic business tycoon's heart thawed. He fell in love with Florida passionately, the way some men fall in love with women. He built a house in St. Augustine, laid a railroad, and then built a resort hotel for his friends and associates so they too could enjoy Florida. Captivated by the countryside, Flagler traveled down the coast until he found what he deemed to be paradise---and in his own private Xanadu this Kublai Khan a stately pleasure dome decreed.That pleasure dome still stands. It is called Palm Beach, now one of the wealthiest cities in America. And here too, Flagler stretched the railroad and built a resort hotel, the massive Breakers, still one of the nation's most imposing hotels.Author Les Standiford says that when Flagler built Palm Beach he also created the class structure of Florida, for the rough service camp of the workers who actually built Palm Beach lay 500 yards across Lake Worth, and later became known as West Palm Beach.  And until 2000, West Palm Beach was the exact opposite of glittering Palm Beach, a ramshackle city, hardly fit to be the County Seat of the largest and wealthiest of Florida's 67 counties. In 2000, a local West Palm Beach judge, later known as ""Hanging Chad,"" gave the Presidential election to George W. Bush, who rewarded West Palm Beach with a blank check urban renewal grant. The shanties along the railroad tracks vanished, and a city of boutique shops, fine restaurants, and recreation venues replaced them, seemingly overnight, despite a flailing economy and a post-9/11 numbness which still lingers. Now, West Palm Beach, though still the poorer relation, has moved from the room over the toolshed into the guesthouse. (Standiford's book came along too early to record this amazing transformation. The book also predates the building of the new Jewfish Creek Bridge in 2008, a flyover which has allowed the area around it to be restored ecologically).Having built Xanadu, Flagler looked around for more worlds to conquer. Rather than going West, he went South, giving a rail connection to sleepy Fort Lauderdale. Further to the South, an enterprising woman named Julia Tuttle, who owned most of the land around an old frontier post named Fort Dallas, traded her land to Flagler for a rail line and urban improvements. The grateful citizens of Fort Dallas vowed to rename their tiny town ""Flagler"" after their benefactor, but Flagler modestly insisted that the city be named for the local native American tribe who'd lived along their namesake Miami River.Having reached Miami, Flagler saw no reason to stop building. At that time, the late nineteenth century, Key West, on faraway Bone Island, was the largest city in Florida, a strange outlier where smugglers, South American insurrectos on the lam, and pirates lived cheek-by-jowl with cigar manufacturers, fishermen, artisans, and artists. And though Bone Island lay about 125 miles across mostly open water dotted by small points of coral and populated by a hardy and independent folk who called themselves Conchs (pronounced ""Konk""), Flagler imagined steel rails leaping over the ocean to connect Key West to the mainland.It was a time of giant dreams. In Great Britain, Ismay and Harland & Wolff were blueprinting a trio of ships to be called the ""Olympic,"" ""Gigantic,"" and ""Titanic.""  The Panama Canal was a-building, and Flagler imagined that Canal transshipments would use bustling Key West as their main port if only items could be easily moved up the line. Havana, too, could be linked to Key West by a twice-daily steamer so the exotic tropical fruits of Cuba could be delivered by rail to New York in 48 hours.In many ways, the building of Flagler's railroad across the sea as recounted here echoes David McCullough's The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914. Both construction projects took place almost simultaneously and faced similar hurdles. Much of the right-of-way for Flagler's train line had to be laboriously hacked out of mangrove swamp jungle and sawgrass wilderness, a Carboniferous Era world that was teeming with billions of malarial mosquitoes, scorpions, wolf spiders, and natural gas spouts, punctuated by Mesozoic Era alligators and snakes, a world where man did not belong and few men had ever ventured. Flagler's surveyor, William Krome, was nearly lost trying to chart a path through mainland Monroe County (an area bigger than Rhode Island with a population numbered just around one hundred even today). And even when a path was found, the unexpected kept happening (Lake Surprise was named for a very simple reason).But where the builders of the Panama Canal were attempting to join two bodies of water, the builders of the railroad were trying to join two bodies of land. The Florida Keys stretch in a languorous arc southwestward away from the mainland. There are hundreds of Keys, the remnant outcroppings of a long-extinct coral reef. The main arc is made up of perhaps three score larger islands, separated in places by channels narrow enough to jump across, and in other places by gaps as wide as seven miles. The Keys have almost no natural fresh water sources, some were covered completely in jungle, and others were practically deserts surrounded by a turquoise sea. All supplies had to be brought in by rail and boat, and new bridgebuilding techniques devised on the fly. Seven Mile Bridge is a wonder, for at its midpoint one might as well be in midocean; no land is visible, except a tiny key or two paralleling the road.Les Standiford, a Florida author of some repute, handles his subject well overall, though LAST TRAIN TO PARADISE is a ""small"" book, the kind of book one finds classed under ""Local Interest"" rather than ""History,"" a book full of little factoids in the text, such as how Marathon, Florida got its name, or the fact that the old abbreviation for Florida, ""FLA"" was said to be an abbreviation for ""Flagler"" as well, since the two were so closely bound together. Les Standiford does make one off-note observation: Like the Canal, many of the men who built the railroad were blacks, either Islanders or African-Americans. Standiford makes the remark that the hard work and heat conditions were surprisingly hard on the descendants of those who'd been slaves, as though immunity to rough conditions should have somehow been genetic in these men. I disliked that comment very much. McCullough spends a good deal of time detailing the daily working lives of the men, including their accommodations, food, and recreation. So does Standiford, right down to the officially invisible floating bawdy houses that lay moored offshore of the Keys (and Panama, too, for that matter; it's quite likely that some of the same men worked both projects and shared the company of some of the same ladies in both locales). While Standiford is no David McCullough, he does well enough in describing the brutal conditions under which the men worked, and their triumphs and setbacks.For there were setbacks. While the Panama Canal had massive landslides in the Culebra Cut that swallowed work camps full of men whole, and then required duplicating the work of digging out amidst the corpses of the unlucky, the railroad faced hurricanes that did the same, and required the same rebuilding of the line under the same duress. Oddly enough, the hurricanes of 1906 and 1908 both struck the line at its point of furthest progress, hurling building supplies (and men) into the ocean and testing (and damaging) the areas just under construction. Much had to be replaced and rebuilt and made stronger, but as time passed, it was time that became the great enemy, for the aging and ailing Flagler wished to ride his rail into Key West before he died.Flagler got his wish in January of 1912, but his vision of Key West as America's major southern port never came true. Mobile and Tampa and especially New Orleans became the great harbors of the Southern Tier. Key West, crammed onto its tiny isle, had no place to grow. As a result, Flagler's East Coast Railway never carried the freight it might have, and went into receivership some years after his death in 1913. Still, it was a popular rail line for tourists who as of a winter's day, as it was said, could board the train in a snowbound New York and wake up in the tropics two days later with a view of nothing but blue sky, white clouds, and a bluegreen sea framed by palm trees.This idyllic adventure remained available until Labor Day 1935, when the most powerful hurricane ever to hit the United States tore through the Upper Middle Keys packing winds of over 200 miles per hour. The barometer dropped as low as and probably lower than 26.35. Keys residents and visitors unfortunate enough to be caught by the storm (which had not been forecast) were killed in the hundreds. Bodies of residents were found 40 miles from their homes, having been carried there on the winds. Twenty years later, three cars belonging to long-missing tourists were unearthed with their skeletonized occupants still inside. The storm unleashed a tsunami estimated to have been anywhere from 20 feet to 40 feet in height that washed away all the trackbed in the Middle Keys and derailed the cars of the rescue train sent to save who could be saved (the engine, weighing in at over 300,000 pounds withstood the wall of water without toppling over).The keening winds sounded a tocsin for the FECRR. Without assets to rebuild, the railroad sold its rights to the State of Florida which built the Overseas Highway to Key West. Nowadays, it is just a few hours drive between Palm Beach and Key West, though a cautious driver who keeps his eyes on the road misses much of the grandeur of the trip. Built in places atop the rail line and in places parallel to it, the Overseas Highway overlooks the gallant ruins of ""Flagler's Folly,"" which still stand as if daring the human soul to envision the impossible and make it real.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z7T3QR0514LB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400049474#wasThisHelpful","R2Z7T3QR0514LB","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had the pleasure of meeting Guy Leekley, the translator/author of this ""new version"" of the TAO TE CHING. Far from a literal word-by-word scholarly translation, Leekley spent many years studying the intent of the original epigrammists, and spent more years unlocking the underlying structural meanings of the various ideographs that make up the text. Each page is watermarked with a kanji that summarizes the epigram presented. Even in paperback this is an elegant volume.What has resulted is an organic, flowing translation which is far different than the stiff translations of traditional translators who accept the interpretations of the kanji as given in Confucian texts as their starting point.Guy Leekley believes that the writers of the TAO TE CHING were Chinese teachers who rejected and were in rebellion against the hierarchical social and intellectual structure promoted by Confucius in favor of independent insights. It was the cross-fertilization of Taoist thought with Buddhist thought that gave rise to Ch'an (Zen), and Leekley has said that his term ""True Seeker"" could be substituted with ""Bodhisattva.""Interestingly, Guy Leekley does not believe that Lao Tzu wrote this work. Due to differences in tone and emphasis, he believes it was written by a number of different contributors over a great deal of time, perhaps hundreds of years. This group might have included Lao Tzu, but Leekley wonders if ""The Old Master"" isn't just an anonymous group title for the contributors.Whatever place you come from, TAO TE CHING: A NEW VERSION FOR ALL SEEKERS will gift you with something wondrous to take away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140VIA6FEXPZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004L2LJH6#wasThisHelpful","R140VIA6FEXPZ6","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those who doubt the reality of the Nazi/occult connection are encouraged to read this book, which is a thorough if somewhat dry history of the influence of racialist philosophers such as Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels upon Hitler. The NSDAP attracted many Ariosophist thinkers and members of occult societies such as the Germanenorden, the Thule Society, and the Edda Society to swell its ranks.Nazi symbols, such as the swastika, the death's head, the iron eagle and the lightning rune were drawn from occult sources and imbued with occult symbolism (and some would say power). Heinrich Himmler made no bones about it (pardon the bad pun): The SS was meant to be a mystical Order.

"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, ""Sword and Sorcery,"" by creating The Lord of the Rings. Some readers will insist that Tolkien's work falls under the rubric of ""High Fantasy,"" but the difference between the two genres seems, to this reviewer, to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet.More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it. In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into the old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls.Tolkien, when he wasn't teaching philology at Oxford, academically translating Anglo-Saxon epics, working on the staff of the Oxford Dictionary of the English Language, or raising his fair-sized family, spent all his adult life creating the LORD OF THE RINGS universe, which includes the entire SILMARILLION legendarium.Tolkien's desire was to create a mythology for England. More properly, one might say he wanted to create a mythology for Anglo-Saxon England based upon it's Germanic roots. Arguably, England's mythology would be the mythology of the original Celts who populated the Scepter'd Isle, but so much of that has been lost under the palimpsest of Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman domination that only fragments remain, and during his lifetime Tolkien admitted he did not much consider the fragments compelling.Although Tolkien began writing THE SILMARILLION legendarium in 1917, it was considered bizarre and ultimately unpublishable by the decision-makers of the day. A history of the speakers of the ""Elvish Tongues,"" it grew out of Tolkien's invention of those tongues. Like a classical composer, Tolkien was compelled to put his favorite sounds down on paper, and once having done so, wove a history around the development of the languages he created, which were based, in part, on Finnish (Quenya, or High-Elven) and Welsh (Sindarin, or Grey-Elven).The legendarium backed into published existence when Tolkien wrote down an episodic bedtime story he had been telling his children over the years. As written down and published it became The Hobbit, the story of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and his amazing journey ""there and back again"" to wrest a treasure from a dragon. Willy-nilly, it contained elements of his legendarium, and quite unexpectedly, it became a best-seller when published in 1937.With his publishers clamoring for a sequel, Tolkien sat down to write it. It took him twelve years to complete, finally seeing the light of day as THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I first read THE TWO TOWERS back in 1976, just as Tolkien's work began to enjoy a resurgence. Having been embraced by 1950s longhairs, and then by 1960s counterculturists who loved its vision of a pastoral and unspoiled Middle-Earth, we in the late 1970s valued it for its escapism (and not a little for the in-joke of good-natured, laid-back Hobbits indulging in ""pipe-weed""). Tolkien's popularity amongst my generation spawned the publication of THE SILMARILLION, the republication of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT in leatherbound editions with typo-corrected texts, and the production of a J.R.R. Tolkien Animated Films Set (The Hobbit/The Lord of the Rings/The Return of the King) in those years.I own the leatherbound editions, and the old Ballantine boxed set editions (seen here) copyrighted 1966 (which I bought in 1976). It's tough to carry the leatherbound editions around (or even read them in bed) and my Ballantine editions have fallen apart due to re-reading and age, so I bought a new boxed set. I'm glad to see that the text in the new set is the corrected text, though the maps in the old paperback edition were larger and clearer.Despite being called a ""trilogy,"" THE LORD OF THE RINGS is not a trilogy in any real sense. Tolkien conceived THE LORD OF THE RINGS as a single volume comprising six books (plus appendices) but the original publisher split the work into three, publishing two books per volume with the appendices included into the third. The titles proposed by Tolkien for separate books were: Book I, ""The First Journey"" or ""The Ring Sets Out""; Book II, ""The Journey of the Nine Companions"" or ""The Ring Goes South""; Book III, ""The Treason of Isengard""; Book IV, ""The Journey of the Ring-bearers"" or ""The Ring Goes East""; Book V, ""The War of the Ring""; and Book VI, ""The End of the Third Age"".Tolkien accepted, but did not like, the publisher-created titles, the ones most readers know. He felt that THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was properly descriptive, but felt that THE RETURN OF THE KING gave away the ending of the story. He preferred THE WAR OF THE RING for the third volume. THE TWO TOWERS is the most obscure of the titles. Does the name refer to Saruman's Isengard and Sauron's Barad-Dur, or to Gondor's Minas Tirith and Mordor's Minas Morgul, or for that matter to the Tower of Cirith Ungol? It could be any of these combinations or others.In synopsis, it is belatedly discovered that The Ring held by the Hobbit Frodo Baggins is the One Ring, the Master Ring of all magical Rings in Middle-Earth. The Ring was created by the Dark Lord Sauron more than two thousand years before, and, having recently (as time is measured in Middle-Earth) re-established his Kingdom in the Land of Mordor, Sauron is seeking the One Ring.THE TWO TOWERS is the second publisher-created volume. It begins right where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING ends. The storyline of THE TWO TOWERS divides in three: Boromir, killed by Orcs at the end of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, is laid to rest by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, who then set out in a seemingly hopeless pursuit of the Orcs who have captured Merry and Pippin. In the course of their pursuit they meet up with Gandalf The White, travel to the Kingdom of Rohan, and bring Rohan into the War, fighting the great Battle of Helm's Deep against the corrupt wizard Saruman.Even as the Battle of Helm's Deep goes on, Merry and Pippin, having escaped the clutches of the Orcs, flee into Fangorn Forest where they become friends with Treebeard the Ent who leads his people against Saruman himself at Saruman's redoubt of Isengard. (In a book filled with invented races and their languages, Tolkien's Ents, a race of living, walking, speaking trees is a stroke of brilliance, a paean to the trees and woods he loved so much.)Frodo and Sam leave the Fellowship in secret and set out to take The Ring back to Mordor, where, if unrecaptured by Sauron, it can be destroyed in the fire where it was first cast. Along the way, they ally themselves with Gollum, the deranged Hobbit who had held The Ring for some 500 years, who acts as their guide into the Black Land.Considering the complexities of maintaining the three storylines, Tolkien demonstrates incredible care in his storytelling. This is not simply authorship, it is the detailed craftsmanship of a master wordsmith. The Moon is in a consistent phase across all three storylines and the weather varies locally but is referenced across-the-board. In all my re-readings of THE TWO TOWERS I have found only two unforced errors: That of Faramir the Captain of Gondor, who rejects The Ring in passing (although, to be fair to Tolkien, he never actually sees it), and the fact that Sam puts on The Ring within the boundaries of Mordor but is not discovered (Frodo, who does so later, is perceived by Sauron).Tolkien, who is the Shakespeare of Sword and Sorcery, sets a high standard for fantasy authors who come after him (not that he ever imagined the legions of writers who would follow in the footsteps of Frodo and his Nine Companions) by crafting his Middle-Earth with such precision and detail.Thus, we are allowed to experience, ""the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at night."" The trees are ""great ilexes of huge girth standing dark and solemn in wide glades,"" the Valley of the Tower of Sorcery, itself illuminated with ""a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light,"" is filled with ""shadowy meads filled with pale white flowers . . . beautiful yet horrible of shape like the demented forms in an uneasy dream."" Even in a battle scene, there comes, ""A blare of trumpets . . . a crash and a flash of flame and darkness."" And of Shelob, the monstrous spider of Cirith Ungol, Tolkien writes, ""All living things were her food and her vomit darkness.""This is poetry. Not just adventure, Tolkien created art---a portrait in words. ""Aiya E√§rendil Elenion Ancalima! Hail E√§rendil, brightest of stars!""  THE TWO TOWERS deserves as many stars as it can get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IGWVYRQ37LLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BS18PY#wasThisHelpful","R3IGWVYRQ37LLK","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frabato was the stage name of the highly-evolved Adept and Bodhisattva Franz Bardon (1909-1958), who wrote three seminal works on hermetic magic.According to this book, ascribed to Bardon as author but actually written by his personal secretary Otti Votavova, Bardon was engaged in an occult war with one of the many black lodges that had sprouted throughout Weimar Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s.Whether a reader wants to take this as a novel or as an inspired biography or even as an inspired autobiography, there is NO question that such lodges existed in interwar Germany, that several (like the Thule Group) had a direct influence on the National Socialist movement, and that Hitler was a member of a black lodge at some point in time. According to FRABATO THE MAGICIAN, Hitler was a member of the very lodge Bardon was pitted against.Eventually, Frabato was forced to flee Germany and return to his native Czechoslovakia. After that nation was conquered by Nazi Germany, Bardon was put into a Concentration Camp. Although he survived the war, his life was ended while in police custody in his then-Communist home country.Those who doubt the reality of the Nazi/occult connection are referred to the filmed funeral of Reinhardt Heydrich which is replete with Nazi occult symbolism and ritual, and to Peter Levenda's Unholy Alliance: A History of Nazi Involvement with the Occult and Goodrick-Clarke's The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology.FRABATO THE MAGICIAN is mesmerizing. I read it in one sitting. Although the writing style is uneven and requires a large suspension of disbelief by readers unfamiliar with the occult, the book has an arresting quality and is well worth the read. It also introduces some of Bardon's practices and beliefs and includes the existing fragment of his last, unfinished work on hermetic magick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21IHF36OABCM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1885928157#wasThisHelpful","R21IHF36OABCM6","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ralph Bakshi, who was most well-known in the 1970s as the creator of the X-rated FRITZ THE CAT and HEAVY TRAFFIC went mainstream with THE LORD OF THE RINGS in 1978. Originally slated to be a two film project, Bakshi wanted to name this LORD OF THE RINGS PART I but was overruled by the studio execs. That should have been his first warning that there wouldn't be a PART II.The existing film includes material from ""The Fellowship of The Ring"" and ""The Two Towers."" Bakshi is faithful to Tolkien's work, even more so than Peter Jackson, though a few of his characterizations are off-key, such as Boromir, who is depicted as a Viking warrior.Come the end of LOTR you WILL be asking yourself, ""Where's the third reel?"" The film ends abruptly---really abruptly---disturbingly so. Merry and Pippin are carried off by Treebeard (who looks like a cartoon version of what eventually became Peter Jackson's Treebeard), we are told that Frodo and Sam are entering Mordor, and the Battle of Helm's Deep is won by the Free Peoples. LOTR then slams shut like an iron door.The film is voiced by an all-British cast (including John Hurt as Aragorn), and where it works, it works wonderfully. The traditional animation is smooth and flowing and seamless. Bakshi also decided to use a technique called rotoscoping in which live-action shots are animated in layover. Bakshi at first intended to rotoscope the whole film.The use of rotoscoping was a groundbreaking cinematic development and earned Bakshi's LOTR a place in the history books. As an aside, Peter Jackson also used some rotoscoping in his LOTR, but the advances in technology between 1978 and 2003 mean that Jackson's rotoscoping was flawless. Unfortunately, Bakshi's was not, primarily because of budget constraints, and it sometimes looks rushed, muddy and distracting.  Later critics have attacked Bakshi's work for its flaws, but much of the problem can be laid at the door of studio beancounters.Considering that Bakshi's LOTR cost just over $3,000,000 to make and gated $30,000,000, it is bizarre that the studio did not order up a sequel. Bakshi later disavowed his LOTR. There's a story there that's yet to be told.  Rankin-Bass, who'd previously done an animated THE HOBBIT for television eventually did create an animated made-for-TV THE RETURN OF THE KING calling it the sequel, but it is very different in sense and substance than Bakshi's work, which, despite its shortcomings, is brilliant in spots, and well worth your time, especially if you are a Tolkien fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQ5OVCXNUREB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HL28AC#wasThisHelpful","RYQ5OVCXNUREB","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"INDEPENDENCE DAY was one of the huge summer blockbusters of 1996. Since then it has thrived on DVD and especially on cable, where, if it isn't on SOME channel every week I begin to worry that the Apocalypse is truly upon us.A fun homage to the ""Samuel Z. Arkoff Presents American International Pictures' Hubcap-on-a-String-Against-a-Blue-Sky-Background"" black & white alien invasion epics of the 1950s, INDEPENDENCE DAY has all the requisites: The goofy scientist who's been locked in his lab too long, the cynical government official, the smart general, the President willing to save the world by leading the good guys into battle, the cocky superheroic fighter pilot, the discredited scientist who saves the world by discovering that the aliens are fatally allergic to room freshener, the wise elder, the washed-out nutcase claiming to have been abducted by the aliens, and the pretty girl who knows it all (as an added bonus it actually has TWO).It also has really yicky-poo-poo slimy yuck aliens who are a cross between arthropods, cephalopods, and human beings. They want to do nothing more than kill us, of course, and to do so they have a Destructo-Ray of some sort that makes Hiroshima look like a clambake.After the Y.-P.-P.S.Y. Aliens wipe out four-fifths of humanity, the Discredited Scientist (played by Jeff Goldblum) comes up with his world-saving idea, which inevitably requires that he and Cocky Superheroic Fighter Pilot (Will Smith) have to sneak aboard the aliens' orbiting hubcap while the World-Saving President (Bill Pullman), who, by the way hates Discredited Scientist, leads the rest of the world into an alien-distracting battle. The day is saved by Washed-Out-Nutcase (Randy Quaid---thanks commenter!---who is maybe not acting at all). And it all happens on---wait for it!---the FOURTH OF JULY!!!!  Yay, America!Think these are spoilers? Don't despair. If you watched CREATURE FEATURES, CHILLER THEATER, or FRIGHT NIGHT growing up (or MST 3000, if you're younger), you've seen INDEPENDENCE DAY in one form or another. No cliche is left unused. No gaping plothole is filled in.And even if you've seen INDEPENDENCE DAY itself, it's a picture that, miraculously, never wears itself out. You can watch this thing 500,000 times and it's still amusing, exciting, and even, cornily, moving in spots. And though it's corny and flaky and even corn-flaky, it never fails to entertain, and that's the sign of a REALLY GREAT FILM. It's the CITIZEN KANE of its genre.Considering that it was budgeted at $75,000,000 and that it's brought in almost $820,000,000 since its release---we can assume that a few people have seen this movie and liked it.

"Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz star in KNIGHT AND DAY, a completely formulaic action-adventure/romantic comedy that premiered in 2010 and has spent its well-deserved oblivion at the bottom of the ""Clearance"" bin at your local video store.KNIGHT AND DAY isn't terrible. It just isn't very good. It's a movie meant to be relegated to the purgatory reserved for 2.5 star celluloid. If they still had double features, this would be the lead-in film despite the supposed drawing power of Cruise, considered an A+ Lister and Diaz, an A- Lister.After watching KNIGHT AND DAY I got curious about the film---either a good sign or a very bad sign---and discovered that it was a piece of intended summer fluff that got stuck in Development Hell for a good long time, with a surprising number of changes of cast, script, scriptwriters, directors, producers, and title (alternate titles included ""Wichita"" and ""Trouble Man""). Somebody owed somebody a favor on this one; otherwise, it would still be locked in the ""script ideas"" file.The tormented history of KNIGHT AND DAY is subtly reflected in the film which has some serious discontinuities of tone and pace and plot, leading to storyline chaos, and a fallback on multiple-use contrivances. There's just far too much use of knock-out drops, for one thing. For another thing, the ""romance"" in this ""romantic comedy"" is strictly pro forma. Cruise and Diaz have little chemistry between them and they never really click.KNIGHT AND DAY bombed at the box office. It's very similar to Killers, another action-adventure-romantic comedy released a few months earlier in 2010 starring the lovely Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher (the very poor man's Tom Cruise), which also tanked.Cruise plays Roy Miller, nee Matthew Knight, a deep-cover CIA agent who specializes in wet work. He's the ""Knight"" of the title. Miller's either the agent who hasn't been turned, or, he's crazy. We can't tell.Diaz plays June Havens, a woman trying to make it home for her sister's wedding day (the ""Day"" of the title---I think---it's never clear). She becomes Miller's at-first unwilling and bewildered companion, who, as the film progresses, spontaneously develops a natural ability with automatic weapons (just like Heigl in KILLERS).Cruise mails in his performance, falling back on his Mission: Impossible muscle memory to play the unstoppable Roy Miller. His trademark boyish charm, which served him so well in Risky Business and Top Gun has, over the years, sadly become a Botox-paralyzed leer, which makes him look like a serial killer on the prowl.As for Diaz, she's cute rather than sexy onscreen, though there are moments where the camera tells us she's aging, and even a shot or two where she looks downright haggard. Cameron wasn't sleeping well on location. She does turn in a far better performance than Cruise, though, having sincere fun with the role of June, the proverbial babe-lost-in-the-woods-turned-supercompetent-accomplice.KNIGHT AND DAY's saving grace is its action sequences, which are well done, essentially continuous (they make up 6/8ths of the film) including a gunfire-punctuated car chase in the midst of the San Fermin Running of the Bulls in Seville, Spain (and no, the Running of the Bulls is NOT limited to Pamplona).If you missed your morning coffee and need a high-octane dose of action, KNIGHT AND DAY is worth a viewing. You'll get your explosions. If you come here looking for fireworks between Cruise and Diaz, KNIGHT AND DAY fizzles.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LI7VQMI0DKA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZG9864#wasThisHelpful","R2LI7VQMI0DKA2","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, ""Sword and Sorcery,"" by creating The Lord of the Rings. Some readers will insist that Tolkien's work falls under the rubric of ""High Fantasy,"" but the difference between the two genres seems, to this reviewer, to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet.More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it. In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into the old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls.Tolkien, when he wasn't teaching philology at Oxford, academically translating Anglo-Saxon epics, working on the staff of the Oxford Dictionary of the English Language, or raising his fair-sized family, spent all his adult life creating the LORD OF THE RINGS universe, which includes the entire Silmarillion legendarium.Tolkien's desire was to create a mythology for England. More properly, one might say he wanted to create a mythology for Anglo-Saxon England based upon it's Germanic roots. Arguably, England's mythology would be the mythology of the original Celts who populated the Scepter'd Isle, but so much of that has been lost under the palimpsest of Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman domination that only fragments remain, and during his lifetime Tolkien admitted he did not much consider the fragments compelling.Although Tolkien began writing THE SILMARILLION legendarium in 1917, it was considered bizarre and ultimately unpublishable by the decision-makers of the day.

It starts out much like THE HOBBIT: Bilbo Baggins throws a magnificent going-away party and sets out for parts unknown. He leaves most of what he owns behind to be inherited by his nephew Frodo, including a magic ring which has the interesting ability to make its wearer invisible. The Ring (always capitalized) also has the ability to confer apparently eternal life and youth, and this makes Gandalf, the Grey Wizard (who appeared in THE HOBBIT as well), suspicious of its provenance.Ultimately, Gandalf discovers that Frodo's Ring is indeed the One Ring, the Master Ring of all magical Rings in Middle-Earth. The Ring was created by the Dark Lord Sauron more than a thousand years before, and, having recently (as time is measured in Middle-Earth) re-established his Kingdom in the Land of Mordor, Sauron is seeking the One Ring.Closely pursued by ""The servants of Sauron"" Frodo flees The Shire, taking the One Ring with him to the temporary haven of Rivendell, where lives Elrond the Half-Elven, a master of wisdom. After a long council, it is decided to take The Ring back to Mordor, where, if unrecaptured by Sauron, it can be destroyed in the fire where it was first cast.The Ring sets out in the company of a Fellowship consisting of four Hobbits, two Men, an Elf, a Dwarf, and Gandalf, but almost immediately their steps are dogged by The Enemy.THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, particularly Book I, is very unlike the remainder of the trilogy. Tolkien was still clearly trying to write a sequel to THE HOBBIT, and so in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING there are some of the avuncular narrator's asides which either made THE HOBBIT so charming or so irritating to a reader, and a kind of chattiness and droll humor that is absent from the rest of the LORD OF THE RINGS, as in""Why are you eavesdropping?""""Beggin' your pardon, but there ain't no eaves in Bag-End, and that's a fact.""""He took along a supply of pipe-weed (but not enough, I'll warrant).""Tolkien also includes many of his own original poems and songs.Ironically enough, this disparate tone works spectacularly well, since it was entirely organic and not planned out. What starts out as a second journey There And Back Again transmogrifies by small increments into a classic epic tale of a Quest, drawing the reader along with it.Tolkien, who is the Shakespeare of Sword and Sorcery, set a high standard for fantasy authors who came after him (not that he ever imagined the legions of writers who would follow in the footsteps of Frodo and his Nine Companions) by crafting his Middle-Earth with such precision and detail. Thus, we are told that ""wisps of fog, like steam, rose off the surface of the dark river,"" and we know what the ""muddy"" ground is like, that a ""sullen"" rain fell, and even what the phase of the moon is.Not just adventure, Tolkien created art---a portrait in words. ""Elen sila lumenn' omentilvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting."" For what it is, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserves as many stars as it can get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FCCK0WFS87HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P4OJ0I#wasThisHelpful","R3FCCK0WFS87HY","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I read BORED OF THE RINGS I wet myself. The second time I read it I tore an abdominal muscle from laughing so hard. The third time I read it my agent cancelled my health, life, and variable annuity policies.They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery . . . but what do they say about satire? BORED OF THE RINGS is the red-haired stepchild of a lighthearted hop skip and jump through The Lord of the Rings by the editors of THE HARVARD LAMPOON (and later THE NATIONAL LAMPOON). Messrs. Beard and Kenney pull the Good Professor's noble mythology inside out, throw in some contemporary (1969) cultural references, and before we can say, ""This ring and no other was made by the Elves/Who'd pawn their own mother to get it themselves"" we find ourselves in Lower Middle Earth.Like any neighborhood named ""Lower"" anything, the place has problems. Sorhed and the Nine Nozdrul want the mighty one ring back, and the only thing that stands between them and incredibly cheesy world domination is the Fellowship of Dildo Bugger (who stole the ring from Goddam, but rather than kill him, pity stayed his hand...""It's a pity I've run out of bullets""), his nephew Frito, Frito's friends Moxie, Pepsi and Spam, the wizard Goodgulf Grayteeth, Stomper The Ranger a.k.a. Arrowroot son of Arrowshirt, Legolam the Elf, Gimlet the Dwarf, and Bromosel, ""the man with the pointed shoes,"" Prince of Minas Troney.Along the way, they meet Tim Benzedrine who teaches them this little ditty, ""Hither come and suck a pipe/Turn thy brains to cheese and tripe"". They run afoul of the Nine Nozdrul (""Arrrgghhh!"" screamed a Nozdrul who just happened to be named Argh), they cross into the Plain of Roi-tan, ""a hot, dry and cheerless place"" (a footnote describes it as ""not unlike Passaic, New Jersey""), they stay awhile in the elven kingdom of  Lornadoon (""the beds looked like they'd been slept in by perverted kangaroos"") and they cross into Fordor to dispose of the ring in the Zazu Pits.Yes, it's a bit crude, but never is it lowbrow. Current-day readers might miss some of the references. ""The Bay of Milhous"" on the enclosed map resembles President Nixon's profile, and ""Eisentower"" appears there too, but as with ""The Land of The Knee-Walking Turkeys"" neither place appears in the text. Like all good satire, BORED OF THE RINGS aims not at the source material it draws from but at the society it comes from.""We have a long way to go,"" said Bromosel gazing across the page at the thick half of the book in the reader's right hand...And, yeah, I really did!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BX018OGT6CZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451094417#wasThisHelpful","R3BX018OGT6CZL","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, ""Sword and Sorcery,"" by creating The Lord of the Rings.

In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into the old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls. The good Professor, an Oxford Don whose specialty was Philology, would be proud of Ms. Kerr, who puts her own fascinating and lively spin on the old myths.The prolific Katharine Kerr taps into the ancient Celtic traditions to create the world of Annwn (literally meaning ""Nowhere"" in Welsh), an incredibly detailed, incredibly graphic land of the imagination filled with lost mountains, far valleys, and towns and villages whose denizens, most unknowingly, exist in a world filled with ""Dweomer.""""Dwimmer,"" meaning ""magic"" or ""sorcery,"" is an ancient English word, probably derived from the original Brythonic language spoken by the Celtic Britons in pre-Roman times. Likewise, ""cwm"" or ""coombe,"" meaning ""valley,"" appears only on Great British maps, the first variant being Welsh and the other Old English. ""Weird"" is a modern English word which means ""bizarre,"" but it derives from the earlier word ""weirding,"" a term applied to occultists who were supposedly able to alter fate.Kerr's representational humans are descendants of European Continental Celts (Gauls), an historic people made up of numerous tribes who were decimated and dominated by the Roman legions commanded by Julius Caesar, circa 50 B.C. According to Kerr's mythology, the tribe living in the invented Gaulish Kingdom Devetia Riga was magically transported to Annwn, where they established the Kingdom of Deverry.In keeping with ancient Celtic beliefs, Kerr crafts her epic in the form of an Eternal Knot. Theoretically, every tale she tells is the beginning, the middle, and the ending of the story. Beginning the series with the first book, Daggerspell or any other of the fifteen novels that make up the series should bring you right back to THE SILVER MAGE, book number fifteen, and the fourth and concluding book in ""The Silver Wyrm"" Cycle. However, given the numerous storylines and recurring characters in different incarnations that have developed over the course of the fifteen novels, it's far easier to read the books in sequence. You're advised to ignore the separate cycles which do not really stand alone.If you haven't read Katharine Kerr's ""Deverry"" books, you will find that very, very unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth, Annwn is rather tumbledown and casually violent. The stink of horse manure fills the air of the towns, roadside inns crawl with lice, ale, the universal drink, is dipped from open barrels (flies and all), drunken men with swords go to war over herds of pigs and cows or an inflated sense of ego disguised as honor, rape and robbery are commonplace, illegitimate children, though scorned, are ubiquitous, and the Deverrian tongue is replete with curses, most of which cannot be reprinted here. Kerr seems to delight in coming up with more and more outrageous expletive phraseology, my favorite of which is, ""By the scaly underside of a dragon's ... !""J.R.R. Tolkien wrote like the restrained University Don he was. Middle Earth has the vertical intellectual airiness of the dreaming spires of Oxford. Kerr writes like the Rust Belt native that she is. Working-class Deverry spills horizontally off the pages in an entertaining flood, which is why it took fifteen full novels to tell the tale.The individual plotlines of the Deverry storylines are straightforward rather than rococo, with just a few curves here and there. There's not a lot of mystery here, not a lot of unanswered questions, and any resolution of suspense tends to be pretty much what you'd predict. In the end, the reader has to keep track of more than enough incarnations and karmic twists that the addition of diversionary plot elements within the stories themselves probably would have had the average reader screaming.The Deverry books concern the life stories of Jill, the heroine of the saga. What Jill does not know is that her life is inextricably bound up with that of the Dweomermaster Nevyn. Long ago, Nevyn was once Galrion, a Prince of the Realm, but youthful impetuosity led to his exile, and more importantly, to the deaths of several innocent people including his royal fiancee, the Princess Brangwen, Jill's preincarnation.Brangwen's tragic death caused Nevyn to take a rash vow---to live until he had undone all the wrong he'd caused. Kerr tells the long tale of Brangwen and Galrion in what amounts to a series of short novelettes-within-the-Deverry-novels. Along the way, Kerr fleshes out her colorful, lively universe, which is populated not only by the Deverrians, but by Elves and Dwarves, among many other beings.In THE SILVER MAGE the dozens of separate strands of storyline in the saga draw ever closer together, becoming a single thread. Most of THE SILVER MAGE concerns itself with the end of the Horsekin Wars.Although THE SILVER MAGE is as well-written as any of the Deverry books, it's uneven. The storyline meanders back and forth from the Elven Westlands, to the Dwarveholt, on to Cerr Cawnen, up to the Northlands, down to Bardek, and on to Cengarn, resolving the past storylines in bits and pieces.I'm just sorry I couldn't give THE SILVER MAGE a fourth star, because though at times it deserves only two, there are moments where it richly deserves five. I've decided to take it right down the middle and give it three.Kerr expends both too much and not enough time and energy going off on tangents in THE SILVER MAGE. For example, Kerr takes us on a few seemingly random journeys in the course of ending her epic. In a past life sequence, we find ourselves in the ancient Elven cities which are under siege by the Horsekin. But Kerr doesn't spend nearly enough time in that era (71 C.E.) to give us the flavor of the years of true Elven greatness.Likewise, far too late in the saga she introduces the race of Dwrgi, who, other than corresponding to Water as the other races correspond to the other Classical Elements (Elves the air, Horsekin fire, Dwarves the Earth, and Humans Aethyr), manage to add essentially nothing to the storyline.Similarly, there are individual characters who are given large and promising introductions. We are led to believe they are going to play major roles,  but then Kerr gives them no set purpose in the story. They make their entrance to the sound of trumpets and exit to the sound of crickets, having done little more than add color to a scene or two.After writing fourteen previous novels, Kerr, with surprising authorial inefficiency, seemed to be cramming this one full of odds and ends just so she could finish up the series. I kept sensing that she meant the Deverry Saga to have one more book (perhaps the fourth of ""The Dragon Mage"" Cycle or a fifth to ""The Silver Wyrm"") in order to really do the series justice, but that, for some reason, she could not make the tale she needed to tell maintain the critical mass to be a fifteenth or sixteenth volume. Instead, book number 15/16 is hidden somewhere inside THE SILVER MAGE like a fetus in fetu.Given the sheer scope and timeline of the Deverry series (at 2.5 million words written over a period of twenty three years, it covers 1000 years of Deverrian history), it's far from amazing that bringing the series to a close would present some real difficulties. Authors far more talented than Kerr (or me) have problems ending their own epic tales. I was seven-eighths of the way through THE SILVER MAGE before I got a whiff of where the book would be ending. I'm not certain that, to that point, Kerr knew either. Or, let me correct that: Kerr has always maintained she had the ending in mind, but that she had just a foggy idea of how to get there. In the end, she got there just by deciding to get there (insert kettle drums here).After the resolution (which I won't spoil), the book ended, ironically enough, with a surprising abruptness. After there being a full fourteen novels about the world of Annwn, THE SILVER MAGE didn't unwind the Eternal Knot Kerr had designed. Instead, like Alexander facing the Gordian Knot, it cut it. THE SILVER MAGE screeched to a halt as though it was a speeding car on the Interstate that just managed to avoid going through the guardrail.The series asked many long-standing questions of itself, starting all the way back in Daggerspell, written in 1986---Why, what, and how, exactly, was Rhodry's wyrd Eldidd's wyrd? And what was the great debt that was owed to Rhodry by Jill through the thousand years the story covers?---Kerr definitely answered the questions in 2009's THE SILVER MAGE, but the answers seemed to lack the necessary gravitas.Very unsatisfactorily, Kerr spent very little time on any sort of coda to her story: Characters who had been of great importance all through the saga left the stage with no fanfare at all, not as much as a fare-thee-well. Lesser characters did not even get an honorable mention as the lights faded.All in all, THE SILVER MAGE, though well-written, seems curiously unfinished.***Having read all of Kerr's Deverry Saga in the matter of a month and a half (roughly a book every three days), I took note of a number of central themes. Here they are, in no particular order:1. CHANGE:  Life is change. Despite what the characters say, that one's fate cannot be turned aside, it's clear that humanity does not know what its fate is. The smallest decisions can cause a ""Butterfly Effect"" which echoes down the ages. And we are that butterfly, always free to flap its wings.2. SOCIAL EVOLUTION:  The Kingdom of Deverry begins its days as a war-torn geographical entity, hardly a Kingdom at all, a place that is wracked by internal strife. Men kill each other over minor points of ""honor."" Although time passes incredibly slowly, and there are many reversals along the way and much fear and xenophobia, ultimately the Kingdom is unified, violence becomes less acceptable, and the kingdom begins to trade with and share knowledge with its various neighboring states. The Taer Angwidd (Unknown Land) of the earliest novels becomes a known land wherein live Elves, Dwarves, Horsekin, Dwrgi, Gel Da'Thae, Dragons, and other humans. ""Ethics"" begins to replace ""honor"" as the basis of the social code.3.  LIFE LESSONS: Every character goes through any number of reincarnations. Your mother in one life may be your mortal enemy in another. Your life is eternal even though the body you wear in any particular life is not. And because each life represents an opportunity to learn, each life is precious.4.  THE ROLE OF RITUAL:  Kerr's ritual is tied up with the use of magic in the Deverry books, but strip away the pyrotechnics and ritual becomes a grounding force in the world, one that helps to define all actions as sacred. This is in keeping with the Kabbalah, upon which she based her dweomer system.5.  THE POWER OF WOMEN:  Kerr is a Feminist, and not for nothing does the great ritual that closes the book involve no men in its working. As the saga evolves, Women become increasingly central to the tale as the teachers, the healers and the bearers of knowledge. Men have temporal power as kings and warriors, but women, as the bearers of Life and Secret Knowledge, are the keepers of the Spirit.***The numerous storylines in the Deverry Saga all become one, ultimately. But here is my summary of them:1. The Tangled Wyrd:  Nevyn, Jill and Rhodry are the three central ""present-day"" characters of the series. Most of the series concerns the interactions of these three, whether in past or present lives.2. The Transformation of Rhodry: Rhodry is born a human warlord, but as the story evolves, he evolves, passing through identities as a human warlord, a human prince, a slave, an elf, a dwarven ally, and a dragon.3.  The Return of The Elves: Having been brutally displaced by the Horsekin from their near mythical cities of the past, the various far-flung Elven survivor communities slowly reunite and begin to re-establish their kingdoms.4.  Evandar's Trick:  Evandar is the mythological Trickster due to whose ill-considered, incompletely thought-out schemes the history of Annwn is so bloody for so long.5.  Alshandra and The Horsekin:  In trying to incarnate his race, Evandar gains the enmity of his wife, Alshandra, whose rekigious/warrior cult soon swells and causes the Horsekin Wars.6.  The Dark Dweomer:  Dark Dweomermasters attempt to destabilize Deverry.7.  The Great Krysello:  Rhodry's half-brother Salamander, a jokester with serious intent travels to The Westlands, Bardek, and The Northlands serving the needs of the kingdom.8.  The Dragons' Lair:  At first merely characters in the Horsekin Wars, the dragons become a major theme that brings the saga to its close, hence linking all storylines.9. King Maryn and The Silver Daggers: In what amounts to an independent novel within the saga, King Maryn unifies Deverry.Another reader might choose different elements; for example, I consider the Dwarven stories (including Haen Marn) to be part of the Horsekin Wars, just as I count the brief story of the Dwrgi under that rubric. I'd be interested in seeing others' comments on this series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F4CJ9SXKSQGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756406315#wasThisHelpful","R1F4CJ9SXKSQGU","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, ""Sword and Sorcery,"" by creating The Lord of the Rings. Some readers will insist that Tolkien's work, and Katharine Kerr's, falls under the rubric of ""High Fantasy,"" but the difference between the two genres seems, to this reviewer, to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet.More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it.

Theoretically, every tale she tells is the beginning, the middle, and the ending of the story, so that beginning the series with The Bristling Wood, book number three, should bring you right up to THE SHADOW ISLE. However, given the numerous storylines and recurring characters in different incarnations that have developed over the course of fourteen novels so far, it's far easier to read the books in sequence (and you're advised to ignore the separate cycles, which do not really stand alone). THE SHADOW ISLE is the fourteenth book in Kerr's fifteen book Deverry series, and is book three of ""The Silver Wyrm Cycle,"" the fourth and concluding cycle in the saga.The Deverry books concern the life stories of Jill, the heroine of the saga. What Jill does not know is that her life is inextricably bound up with that of the Dweomermaster Nevyn. Long ago, Nevyn was once Galrion, a Prince of the Realm, but youthful impetuosity led to his exile, and more importantly, to the deaths of several innocent people including his royal fiancee, the Princess Brangwen, Jill's preincarnation.Brangwen's tragic death caused Nevyn to take a rash vow---to live until he had undone all the wrong he'd caused.

Along the way, Kerr fleshes out her colorful, lively universe, which is populated not only by the Deverrians, but by Elves and Dwarves, among many other beings.THE SHADOW ISLE begins with an interesting turn. Haen Marn, the Shadow Isle of the title is a dweomer island, occupied by dwarves. It has, to this point, played a minor role in the saga, but in this eponymous book, Kerr gives it it's due.Haen Marn vanished from Annwn when the Horsekin raids began some sixty years ago, rematerializing in the very earthly country of medieval Alba. For those of us who are not Celticists, Alba (or Alban) is the ancient Celtic name for Scotland. The Albans seem entirely nonplussed by the appearance of the dweomer island, assuming it came from Cymru (Wales) because of the language its odd inhabitants speak. For the denizens of Haen Marn, Alba seems Deverry-like, but they are bewildered by the cult of the sheep worshippers---at least that's their assumption about the Holy Lamb of God. Kerr, like all authors, can't resist the obligatory inside jokes that propel all storytelling. The hoped-for return of Haen Marn to Annwn may well be the first sign that peace is returning, in what has become essentially a world war.The Elves, after a thousand year long nomadic existence, are beginning to settle in towns, and there is talk of returning to their ancient cities if only the Horsekin raids can be stopped.In Deverry, things are taking dark turns. Although the Deverrians and their allies manage to defeat the invading Horsekin in set battles, their victories have not blunted the Horsekin appetite for raiding, pillaging, slaughter and slavetaking.Neb and Branna continue to study dweomer, though Neb is fixated on his past life as Nevyn. Considering himself the world's greatest dweomermaster returned, he begins to condescend to his teachers, and in his attempt to recover all of Nevyn's vast knowledge, he takes steps that may or may not lead him away from the Light.If you haven't read Katharine Kerr's ""Deverry"" books, you will find that very, very unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth, Annwn is rather tumbledown and casually violent. The stink of horse manure fills the air of the towns, roadside inns crawl with lice, ale, the universal drink, is dipped from open barrels (flies and all), drunken men with swords go to war over herds of pigs and cows or an inflated sense of ego disguised as honor, rape and robbery are commonplace, illegitimate children, though scorned, are ubiquitous, and the Deverrian tongue is replete with curses, most of which cannot be reprinted here.

Nothing begins or ends here, despite the idea of some readers that THE SHADOW ISLE would end the series. Rather, it's a bridge to the concluding book of the Deverry Saga, The Silver Mage.Although THE SHADOW ISLE isn't able to stand alone, the quality of Kerr's writing continues to reach the same high standards it has evolved toward over the twenty years it took her to write the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R80HX22OIJN5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756405521#wasThisHelpful","R80HX22OIJN5A","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Theoretically, every tale she tells is the beginning, the middle, and the ending of the story, so that beginning the series with The Red Wyvern, book number nine, should bring you right up to THE SPIRIT STONE. However, given the numerous storylines and recurring characters in different incarnations that have developed over the course of thirteen novels so far, it's far easier to read the books in sequence (and you're advised to ignore the separate cycles, which do not really stand alone). THE SPIRIT STONE is the thirteenth book in Kerr's fifteen book Deverry series, and is book two of ""The Silver Wyrm Cycle,"" the fourth and concluding cycle in the saga.The Deverry books concern the life stories of Jill, the heroine of the saga. What Jill does not know is that her life is inextricably bound up with that of the Dweomermaster Nevyn. Long ago, Nevyn was once Galrion, a Prince of the Realm, but youthful impetuosity led to his exile, and more importantly, to the deaths of several innocent people including his royal fiancee, the Princess Brangwen, Jill's preincarnation.Brangwen's tragic death caused Nevyn to take a rash vow---to live until he had undone all the wrong he'd caused. Kerr tells the long tale of Brangwen and Galrion in what amounts to a series of short novelettes-within-the-Deverry-novels. Along the way, Kerr fleshes out her colorful, lively universe, which is populated not only by the Deverrians, but by Elves and Dwarves, among many other beings.THE SPIRIT STONE follows immediately upon The Gold Falcon.  The warlike Horsekin, driven by their increasing religious fervor for the Alshandra Cult, have built a fortress right at the place where Horsekin lands, Gel Da'Thae lands, Elven lands, Dwarven lands, the Kingdom of Deverry and The Rhiddaer all share their borders, essentially dominating Annwn with the ability to strike in any direction. The fortress must be destroyed.After briefly sketching out the crisis facing modern-day Deverry, Kerr takes us back in time to just before the opening of Daggerspell (book one of the saga). After the death of Branoic the Silver Dagger, Nevyn has been searching for Brangwen's latest reincarnation, and finds her. Her name is Morwen, and she is Jill's immediate preincarnation. Abused, mocked and feared as a witch for having a harelip, Morwen's only real happiness in life is being nursemaid to Salamander, who is her young, half-elven nephew. When Salamander's Elven father comes to take him away from his neglectful mother, Morwen happily goes with them. She befriends Loddlaen, the son of Nevyn's old apprentice, the dweomermaster Aderyn and the Elven dweomermaster Dallandra. Not even a formal apprentice himself, Loddlaen, unbeknownst to anyone else, recklessly decides to teach Morwen dweomer.The second half of THE SPIRIT STONE recounts the assault on the Horsekin fortress of Zak Gral. During the assault, Salamander discovers a ""shewstone"" that holds the secret to the Silver Wyrm's transformation back into a man.If you haven't read Katharine Kerr's ""Deverry"" books, you will find that very, very unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth, Annwn is rather tumbledown and casually violent. The stink of horse manure fills the air of the towns, roadside inns crawl with lice, ale, the universal drink, is dipped from open barrels (flies and all), drunken men with swords go to war over herds of pigs and cows or an inflated sense of ego disguised as honor, rape and robbery are commonplace, illegitimate children, though scorned, are ubiquitous, and the Deverrian tongue is replete with curses, most of which cannot be reprinted here.

In the end, the reader has to keep track of more than enough incarnations and karmic twists that the addition of diversionary plot elements within the stories themselves probably would have had the average reader screaming.In reviewing the earlier Deverry novels, I noted that Kerr's writing was often unpolished and rough-edged despite the incredible energy of her storytelling. Kerr's introductions of new characters and plot twists always seemed to have an odd sense of afterthought about them. Since the series is written non-linearly, Kerr was able to plug in elements as needed to move the storylines along, but these plug-ins sometimes seemed sloppy, as when  unforeshadowed events suddenly troubled preincarnated characters we already thought we knew well, throwing the basis of their storylines a bit out of balance. In THE SPIRIT STONE, Kerr takes the time to put a fine finish on the rough edges, and to clean up after herself, literarily.The volumes of ""The Silver Wyrm"" Cycle ""feel"" different than the rest of the Deverry Saga; there is a sense of completeness to them that the earlier volumes simply didn't have. This is not merely because the story is drawing to its close. Rather, the books feel more self-contained. A reader, unfamiliar with Deverry, could pick up THE SPIRIT STONE and enjoy it as a stand-alone novel.Kerr's authorial voice is stronger than it has ever been. In describing Morwen's first sight of the Sea of Grass, Kerr writes so splendidly that even I, a person with no graphic arts talent to speak of, was moved to consider sketching what she presented to my mind's eye, a perfect portrait in words.As I noted in my review of The Gold Falcon, Kerr suffered a serious health problem and was forced to take a lengthy hiatus from the Deverry saga between 2000 and 2006. While just a shade less satisfying than its predecessor book, THE SPIRIT STONE earns five well-deserved stars.  Katharine Kerr's ability to write matured tremendously in those six years, and her deft handling of plot twists, past events, and new characters is a sign of her growing ability and sheer talent as an author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFRZUOLM3M0JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756404770#wasThisHelpful","RFRZUOLM3M0JS","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this extremely unoriginal book when it first came out in 1977, around the same time as The Silmarillion. Tolkien was all the rage then with my friends, mostly, I think, because the happy Hobbits smoked a lot of pipe-weed. But that's something else.THE SWORD OF SHANNARA is the illegitimate spawn of The Fellowship of the Ring. A group of people, including a couple of rustics, a dwarf, elves, men, and a wizard, go on a Quest, involving a long trek, a dark cavern and an evil monster, all because of the aforementioned sword of the title.I hated this book when I first read it at age 17, because it was SO, SO nakedly derivative of Tolkien, and weakly written to boot. It was JRRT without the epic style. Every time Hendyl was described as an ""irascible dwarf"" (and that was every time Hendyl was described) I wanted to spit. I suppose that, as per The Lord of the Rings all dwarves (except Snow White's boyfriends) are irascible. Why couldn't Hendyl just be a nice guy? THAT would have been original.Of course, almost all modern Sword and Sorcery/High Fantasy owes it's existence to Tolkien. Feist and Kerr, and Kurtz, and George Lucas in STAR WARS, and others have recognizable dwarves and elves and dark lords (though they may be called by different names or not).  But Brooks went nuts. Every character, the settings, the plot, the whole schmear, is Tolkien rebooted in safe mode.Commenters say Brooks started THE SWORD OF SHANNARA in 1967, prior to reading Tolkien in college, and finished THE SWORD OF SHANNARA in law school. For one thing, ""starting"" a book could mean that he wrote seven paragraphs and laid it aside for five years; in short, it means nothing.Brooks unquestionably read Tolkien before or while writing the bulk of THE SWORD OF SHANNARA. I will give him credit, though, if he could write anything, no matter how thin and derivative, besides exams during law school.In the recent past, I did try to read The Elfstones of Shannara, but gave it up within a few pages. I also tried re-reading this, but gave it up almost as quickly. It couldn't hold me; I already knew the story, and the quality of the writing is, very, very unlike Tolkien, too watery to sustain a second visit to Shady Vale.The egg salad quality of the writing is what truly distinguishes this book from Tolkien. Given the baldly derivative nature of Brooks' novel, I'm surprised that the Del Rey imprint was launched with this book, and I'm equally surprised that this has remained a big seller. But then, in 1977, there wasn't much Fantasy around, as opposed to today, where it drips off the bookshelves.As an adult, I'll revise my opinion of THE SWORD OF SHANNARA upward just a tick. ""Hate"" is far too strong an emotion to expend on this book, but I wouldn't recommend it.I suppose that pre-teens new to Fantasy and people who can't hack their way through Tolkien's idiosyncratic written brand of Brewer's Biblical can enter the fantasy portal here.

Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, ""Sword and Sorcery,"" by creating The Lord of the Rings (I was recently advised by a role-playing fanatic that Tolkien's work, and Katharine Kerr's, falls under the rubric of ""High Fantasy,"" but the difference between the two genres seems to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet).More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it.

Likewise, ""cwm"" or ""coombe,"" meaning ""valley,"" appears only on Great British maps, the first variant being Welsh and the other Old English. ""Weird"" is a modern English word which means ""bizarre,"" but it derives from the earlier word ""weirding,"" a term applied to occultists who were supposedly able to alter fate.Kerr's representational humans are descendants of European Continental Celts (Gauls), an historic people made up of numerous tribes who were decimated and dominated by the Roman legions commanded by Julius Caesar, circa 50 B.C. According to Kerr's mythology, the tribe living in the invented Gaulish Kingdom Devetia Riga was magically transported to Annwn, where they established the Kingdom of Deverry.In keeping with ancient Celtic beliefs, Kerr crafts her epic in the form of an Eternal Knot. Theoretically, every tale she tells is the beginning, the middle, and the ending of the story, so that beginning the series with A Time of Exile, book number five, should bring you to the first book in the saga, Daggerspell. However, given the numerous storylines and recurring characters in different incarnations that have developed over the course of twelve novels so far, it's far easier to read the books in sequence (and you're advised to ignore the separate cycles, which do not really stand alone). THE GOLD FALCON is the twelfth book in Kerr's fifteen book Deverry series, and is book one of ""The Silver Wyrm Cycle,"" the fourth and concluding cycle in the saga.The Deverry books concern the life stories of Jill, the heroine of the saga. What Jill does not know is that her life is inextricably bound up with that of the Dweomermaster Nevyn. Long ago, Nevyn was once Galrion, a Prince of the Realm, but youthful impetuosity led to his exile, and more importantly, to the deaths of several innocent people including his royal fiancee, the Princess Brangwen, Jill's preincarnation.Brangwen's tragic death caused Nevyn to take a rash vow---to live until he had undone all the wrong he'd caused. Kerr tells the long tale of Brangwen and Galrion in what amounts to a series of short novelettes-within-the-Deverry-novels, which now number fifteen. Along the way, Kerr fleshes out her colorful, lively universe, which is populated not only by the Deverrians, but by Elves and Dwarves, among many other beings.The world of Annwn has changed a great deal since the days of The Fire Dragon (book number eleven). THE GOLD FALCON opens some forty years after the Deverrian victories in the Battles of Cengarn and Cerr Cawnen. The Elves of The Westlands and the Elves of the Southern Isles have been reunited. The Guardians have begun to be born into the world of Time, but being very new souls, most of them are suffering from a condition much like autism. The folk of The Rhiddaer, the Elves, the Dwarves, the Gel Da'Thae, and the people of Deverry have ongoing military alliances and trade agreements. They have been able to hold off the Horsekin Hordes, but the Alshandra Cult continues to spread, with converts even in Deverry and the Rhiddaer. Alshandra's priests and priestesses call for the destruction of the Elves. ""Witnessing,"" dying in Alshandra's name, is considered a holy act. War is imminent.Some 550 years have passed since Brangwen's death. It has been 70 years since Nevyn's death and 40 since Jill's. Both Nevyn and Jill have been reincarnated, this time as Neb the Scribe and Lady Branna, a dowerless daughter of a minor lord. They meet and fall in love and are betrothed. Their long-delayed lovers' reunion causes their great, dormant dweomer powers to become manifest, and although they both begin to remember their past lives and knowledge, they still need to be trained. Salamander, returned from Bardek, and Dallandra the Elven Dweomermaster, undertake to train their own former teachers.If you haven't read Katharine Kerr's ""Deverry"" books, you will find that very, very unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth, Annwn is rather tumbledown and casually violent. The stink of horse manure fills the air of the towns, roadside inns crawl with lice, ale, the universal drink, is dipped from open barrels (flies and all), drunken men with swords go to war over herds of pigs and cows or an inflated sense of ego disguised as honor, rape and robbery are commonplace, illegitimate children, though scorned, are ubiquitous, and the Deverrian tongue is replete with curses, most of which cannot be reprinted here. Kerr seems to delight in coming up with more and more outrageous expletive phraseology, my favorite of which is, ""By the scaly underside of a dragon's ... !""J.R.R. Tolkien wrote like the restrained University Don he was. Middle Earth has the vertical intellectual airiness of the dreaming spires of Oxford. Kerr writes like the Rust Belt native that she is. Working-class Deverry spills horizontally off the pages in an entertaining flood, which is why it took fifteen full novels to tell the tale.The individual plotlines of the Deverry storylines are straightforward rather than rococo, with just a few curves here and there. There's not a lot of mystery here, not a lot of unanswered questions, and any resolution of suspense tends to be pretty much what you'd predict. In the end, the reader has to keep track of more than enough incarnations and karmic twists that the addition of diversionary plot elements within the stories themselves probably would have had the average reader screaming.Due to a serious health problem, Kerr was forced to take a lengthy hiatus from the Deverry Saga between 2000 and 2006. Her ability to write matured tremendously in those six years. THE GOLD FALCON brims with a sense of joy. Kerr survived her own illness and in celebration, she has brought her creations home. In reviews of the past Deverry novels, I have taken Kerr to task as not much of a literary stylist. Her writing always had rough edges and a lack of polish, despite the amazing energy of her storytelling. She was a competent popular novelist, but hers was never the type of writing that inspired cheers or tears in a reader. THE GOLD FALCON does.Although THE GOLD FALCON is a simple, straightforward tale told in the Deverrian present, lacking any preincarnation or reincarnation episodes or major plot twists, the quality of Kerr's writing has reached a new level in this book, which rightly and richly deserves six stars. Wedded to her already impressive storytelling abilities, the fineness of the wordcraft in THE GOLD FALCON makes this far and away the best of the Deverry novels so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZE8GBB6QSH9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756404193#wasThisHelpful","RZE8GBB6QSH9R","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Theoretically, every tale she tells is the beginning, the middle, and the ending of the story, so that beginning the series with The Spirit Stone, book number thirteen, should bring you right back to THE FIRE DRAGON. However, given the numerous storylines and recurring characters in different incarnations that have developed over the course of eleven novels so far, it's far easier to read the books in sequence (and you're advised to ignore the separate cycles, which do not really stand alone). THE FIRE DRAGON is the eleventh book in Kerr's fifteen book Deverry series, and is book three of ""The Dragon Mage Cycle,"" the third cycle of the four in the saga.The Deverry books concern the life stories of Jill, the heroine of the saga. What Jill does not know is that her life is inextricably bound up with that of the Dweomermaster Nevyn. Long ago, Nevyn was once Galrion, a Prince of the Realm, but youthful impetuosity led to his exile, and more importantly, to the deaths of several innocent people including his royal fiancee, the Princess Brangwen, Jill's preincarnation.Brangwen's tragic death caused Nevyn to take a rash vow---to live until he had undone all the wrong he'd caused. In THE FIRE DRAGON, Nevyn, his apprentice Lady Lillorigga and Jill's male preincarnation, Branoic the Silver Dagger, place Prince Maryn on the throne of Deverry.Kerr tells the long tale of Brangwen and Galrion in what amounts to a series of short novelettes-within-the-Deverry-novels, which now number fifteen. Along the way, Kerr fleshes out her colorful, lively universe, which is populated not only by the Deverrians, but by Elves and Dwarves, among many other beings.At one point in the Author's note, Kerr describes ""The Dragon Mage"" Cycle as a quintet of books. Apparently, The Gold Falcon, which she had already begun, was intended to be part of the quintet as well. Kerr had, as with Days of Air and Darkness, obviously reached another turning point in her storytelling and was unsure what direction to take. In the event, ""The Dragon Mage"" became not the longest of the Cycles but the shortest, a triptet.An attentive reader, particularly one who is reading the books in sequence, will discover descriptive paragraphs spotted here and there that were lifted whole from earlier volumes. It's a minor quirk. This happened in Days of Blood and Fire and Days of Air and Darkness, where the Deverry Saga had also begun to take seemingly unexpected turns. Apparently, this slightly nettling use of cut-and-paste is an indication of Kerr catching her literary breath. Fortunately, in THE FIRE DRAGON, it's much less noticeable than before (where it was hardly noticeable), which means that only a truly Obsessive-Compulsive reader like myself would catch it. It takes nothing away from the storylines.The first half of THE FIRE DRAGON concerns the unfinished storyline of Prince Maryn and the Silver Daggers begun in The Bristling Wood and continued in A Time of Omens, The Red Wyvern and  The Black Raven. King Maryn's reign over a reunified Kingdom of Deverry, conceived in glory, has been birthed in tragedy. Kerr teaches the reader a critical lesson of history, fictive and non-fictive, that despite the chronicled victories of males won on battlefields, much of the unchronicled fate of kingdoms lies with females in the Women's Hall, in Milady's bedchamber, and in the hands of midwives.THE FIRE DRAGON's second half continues the tale of present-day Deverry. An alliance of Elves, Dwarves, Humans, Gel Da'Thae, and the dragon Arzosah Sothy Lorezohaz  has defeated the Horsekin Army of the putative goddess Alshandra at the Siege of Cengarn. In the wake of victory, a mixed company of Elves, Dwarves and Men (along with Arzosah) escorts Jahdo Ratter back to his distant home of Cerr Cawnen, hoping for a defensive alliance with the citizens of the Rhiddaer. Shortly after they arrive in Cerr Cawnen, a Gel Da'Thae deputation reaches the city, also seeking the same alliance.Cerr Cawnen is thrown into chaos however, when the High Priestess of Alshandra's cult, the Raven Woman, who was at the Siege of Cengarn, arrives with a small army of Horsekin who are demanding the aid of the Rhiddaerfolk against the Deverrians and their allies. A dweomer-battle ensues in Cerr Cawnen, and though the Horsekin are again defeated, Rhodry Maelwaedd is mortally injured in the battle. The Guardian Evandar, preparing to follow his people into the world of Time, works one last great dweomer, and Rhodry, who has been undergoing a metamorphosis throughout the saga, is transformed into a dragon, the Silver Wyrm of the fourth cycle; and so ends THE FIRE DRAGON and ""The Dragon Mage"" Cycle.Kerr has created a raft of memorable and vivid characters and events in the series, and THE FIRE DRAGON is one of the best books of the entire series. If you haven't read Katharine Kerr's ""Deverry"" books, you will find that very, very unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth, Annwn is rather tumbledown and casually violent. The stink of horse manure fills the air of the towns, roadside inns crawl with lice, ale, the universal drink, is dipped from open barrels (flies and all), drunken men with swords go to war over herds of pigs and cows or an inflated sense of ego disguised as honor, rape and robbery are commonplace, illegitimate children, though scorned, are ubiquitous, and the Deverrian tongue is replete with curses, most of which cannot be reprinted here.

Along the way, Kerr fleshes out her colorful, lively universe, which is populated not only by the Deverrians, but by Elves and Dwarves, among many other beings.THE BLACK RAVEN is the tenth book in Kerr's fifteen book Deverry series, and is book two of ""The Dragon Mage Cycle,"" the third cycle of the four in the saga.Half of THE BLACK RAVEN takes place in the Deverrian present. Having been defeated at the Siege of Cengarn, the followers of the Guardian Alshandra (who had been masquerading as a war goddess) are scattered. The High Priestess of Alshandra's cult, the Raven Woman, has fled. Without Alshandra's interference, the Guardian Evandar has convinced most members of his race to incarnate in the world of Time.The second half of THE BLACK RAVEN concerns the unfinished storyline of Prince Maryn and the Silver Daggers begun in The Bristling Wood and continued in A Time of Omens and The Red Wyvern. Prince Maryn has all but won the war and ended the century-long Time of Troubles, but the emphasis is on ""all but."" A skilled and victorious warleader, the charismatic Maryn, unused to being said nay, must struggle with the politicking and intrigues of his slowly-coalescing Court, the remaining lords still at war with him, and, possibly worst, the hearthstone strife caused by his indiscriminate womanizing.Kerr is a talented storyteller but not a literary stylist. Kerr has created a raft of memorable and vibrant characters in the series, particularly the womenfolk, of whom Princess Bellyra and Lady Lillorigga especially stand out in THE BLACK RAVEN.  But, as has been a problem in past volumes, Kerr's introductions of new characters and plot twists seem to have an odd sense of afterthought about them. Since the series is written non-linearly, Kerr is able to plug in elements as needed to move the storylines along, but in THE BLACK RAVEN, these plug-ins sometimes have the feel of lumpy spackle hurriedly applied to the various unplugged holes in the huge storyboard she has created.In THE BLACK RAVEN unforeshadowed events suddenly trouble preincarnated characters we already know well, throwing the basis of their storylines a bit out of balance. The series would not have this feel if Kerr could randomly rearrange the various segments of the several progressing stories she is telling---indeed, she extensively re-wrote both Daggerspell) and Darkspell at one point in order to strengthen the series---but even this reviewer admits ruefully that ridding the Deverry books of a fault most readers would hardly notice  would require her to essentially re-write the series from back to front, a ridiculous proposition.If you haven't read Katharine Kerr's ""Deverry"" books, you will find that very, very unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth, Annwn is rather tumbledown and casually violent.

Along the way, Kerr fleshes out her colorful, lively universe, which is populated not only by the Deverrians, but by Elves and Dwarves, among many other beings.THE RED WYVERN is the ninth book in Kerr's fifteen book Deverry oeuvre, and is book one of ""The Dragon Mage Cycle,"" the third cycle of the four in the saga. As such, it marks a midpoint, a place where all the strands of the intricate Celtic knot she's designing overlay each other.Kerr, who had been publishing the Deverry books at the rate of one a year, wisely took more time to craft THE RED WYVERN, and the positive results are evident. This is a tightly-written story that addicts the reader virtually from the first page. This reviewer read THE RED WYVERN, all 416 pages of it, in one sitting.Four-fifths of THE RED WYVERN concerns the unfinished storyline of Prince Maryn and the Silver Daggers begun in The Bristling Wood and continued in A Time of Omens. Kerr emphasizes a heretofore minor character, Lady Merodda, as the tale progresses. We also meet her daughter, the lovely young Lady Lillorigga, whose Dweomer talent is being misused by the enemies of Prince Maryn. Lillorigga, with Nevyn at her side, must work to undo the evil.The remaining fifth of THE RED WYVERN gives us brief glimpses of the land of the Rhiddaer, the city of Cengarn, and the dweomer island of Haen Marn, as well as keeping us up on the progress of the characters Dallandra, Rhodry, and Evandar the Guardian. These glimpses resolve themselves into intersections within the overall plot.Unlike most Sword and Sorcery/High Fantasy authors, Kerr creates very strong female characters, starting with Jill. Although the men of Deverry believe they are in charge, it's becoming increasingly clear that the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules Annwn.If you haven't read Katharine Kerr's ""Deverry"" books, you will find that very, very unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth, Annwn is rather tumbledown and casually violent.

Likewise, ""cwm"" or ""coombe,"" meaning ""valley,"" appears only on Great British maps, the first variant being Welsh and the other Old English. ""Weird"" is a modern English word which means ""bizarre,"" but it derives from the earlier word ""weirding,"" a term applied to occultists who were supposedly able to alter fate.In keeping with ancient Celtic beliefs, Kerr crafts her epic in the form of an Eternal Knot. Theoretically, every tale she tells is the beginning, the middle, and the ending of the story, so that beginning the series with Darkspell, book number two, should bring you to DAYS OF AIR AND DARKNESS.DAYS OF AIR AND DARKNESS, the eighth book in the fifteen book Deverry saga, is the concluding fourth book of ""The Westlands Cycle,"" the second of four cycles in the saga.DAYS OF AIR AND DARKNESS was originally supposed to be the second book of a planned trilogy, as reflected in its formatting, since like it's predecessor book, Days of Blood and Fire, DAYS OF AIR AND DARKNESS is divided into numbered chapters titled, strangely enough, given Deverrian antipathy to the 'Rhwmanes,' in Latin.Kerr's representational humans are descendants of European Continental Celts (Gauls), an historic people made up of numerous tribes who were decimated and dominated by the Roman legions commanded by Julius Caesar, circa 50 B.C. According to Kerr's mythology, the tribe living in the invented Gaulish Kingdom Devetia Riga was somehow magically transported to Annwn, where they established the Kingdom of Deverry.The Deverry books concern the life stories of Jill, the heroine of the saga. What Jill does not know is that her life is inextricably bound up with that of the Dweomermaster Nevyn. Long ago, Nevyn was once Galrion, a Prince of the Realm, but youthful impetuosity led to his exile, and more importantly, to the deaths of several innocent people including his royal fiancee, the Princess Brangwen, who is now reincarnated as Jill. Brangwen's tragic death caused Nevyn to take a rash vow---to live until he had undone all the wrong he'd caused. DAYS OF AIR AND DARKNESS continues the story of the Siege of Cengarn begun in Days of Blood and Fire. Jill uses her powers as the greatest human Dweomermaster to attempt to turn the tide of battle.Kerr tells the long tale of Brangwen and Galrion in what amounts to a series of short novelettes-within-the-Deverry-novels. Along the way, Kerr fleshes out her colorful, lively universe, which is populated not only by the Deverrians, but by Elves and Dwarves, among many other beings.Unlike Days of Blood and Fire which recounts a story told entirely in the Deverrian ""present,"" Kerr returns to her non-linear style of preincarnation flashbacks and reincarnation flashforwards that have been typical of the saga. In this case we return to Jill and Rhodry's younger years and meet the winsome Lady Sevinna who is the intended target of a poisoner. Kerr's characters are born, die, and are reborn time and time again, as they work out their incredibly complex interlinked karmic ""Wyrds"".DAYS OF AIR AND DARKNESS is a tightly-written, exciting and intricately detailed story written in the highly cinematic style that Kerr makes her own. Still, an attentive reader, particularly one who is reading the books in sequence, will discover descriptive paragraphs spotted here and there that were lifted whole from earlier volumes. While a description of a Dweomer technique for example, might not really change from book to book, Kerr should have taken the minimal time to reorder sentences or replace an adjective or two in such gleanings. Kerr was apparently tiring of churning out a book every eight months or so, and it shows. In point of fact it was to be two years before the next book in the Deverry  saga,The Red Wyvern was published.If you haven't read Katharine Kerr's ""Deverry"" books, you will find that very, very unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth, Annwn is rather tumbledown and casually violent. The stink of horse manure fills the air of the towns, roadside inns crawl with lice, ale, the universal drink, is dipped from open barrels (flies and all), drunken men with swords go to war over herds of pigs and cows or an inflated sense of ego disguised as honor, rape and robbery are commonplace, illegitimate children, though scorned, are ubiquitous, and the Deverrian tongue is replete with curses, most of which cannot be reprinted here. Kerr seems to delight in coming up with more and more outrageous expletive phraseology, my favorite of which is, ""By the scaly underside of a dragon's ... !""J.R.R. Tolkien wrote like the restrained University Don he was. Middle Earth has the vertical intellectual airiness of the dreaming spires of Oxford. Kerr writes like the Rust Belt native that she is. Working-class Deverry spills horizontally off the pages in an entertaining flood, which is why it took fifteen full novels to tell the tale.The plotline of the Deverry books is straightforward rather than rococo, with just a few curves here and there. There's not a lot of mystery here, not a lot of unanswered questions, and any resolution of suspense tends to be pretty much what you'd predict. In the end, the reader has to keep track of more than enough incarnations and karmic twists that the addition of diversionary plot elements probably would have had the average reader screaming.Kerr is not a great literary stylist, but she is a damn good straight-on storyteller. And if you're visiting Deverry, that's what you'll find. A damn good story that you can enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17MT1HA3K9VBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553572628#wasThisHelpful","R17MT1HA3K9VBK","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE DEBT is more of a psychological thriller than an action thriller. The action simply provides the bedrock for the psychodrama. THE DEBT is a remake of a 2007 Israeli film which was rather different.The acting in THE DEBT is excellent, particularly that of Jessica Chastain as the younger Rachel. Chastain is a talented actress who, though she has appeared in many films, has fortunately managed to avoid celebrity. Helen Mirren, who plays the older Rachel turns in her usual work of stellar caliber.It is 1965. Stefan, David and Rachel are Mossad agents tasked to capture the Mengele-esque ""Surgeon of Birkenau,"" a Dr. Vogel, who is living inconspicuously in East Berlin, practicing gynecology twenty years after escaping justice for his war crimes of useless and horrifying medical experiments on Auschwitz inmates.They capture Dr. Vogel but when they attempt to sneak him ""over the wall"" into West Berlin things go badly awry, and so the three agents are forced to care for him while awaiting extraction. Realizing that his captors have become as much a set of prisoners as he himself, the wily Vogel (who is an unrepentant Nazi to the core) begins to torment them psychologically; eventually, he makes his escape.Recriminations fly back and forth. Finally, Stefan convinces David and Rachel to agree to the story that they killed Dr. Vogel while he was trying to escape. Eventually, they are extracted, and return to Israel as heroes, where they are feted and invited to speak publicly about their successful mission.Thirty-odd years pass. Stefan is now head of the Mossad. Stefan and Rachel have been married and divorced, and have a daughter who is a notable Israeli journalist. Their daughter writes their memoirs which become an international best-seller.At the same time that their daughter's book comes to print, a Ukrainian journalist announces that he has gotten an exclusive interview with a old man claiming to be the Surgeon of Birkenau. Rachel, Stefan and David's thirty-five year old lie begins to unravel. How they deal with that unraveling and the consequences they face make up the kernel of THE DEBT.I didn't like THE DEBT. I can't appreciate films where the motives and motivations of the characters get twisted into Turkish Taffy by dint of their own stupidity. There's something pathetic about watching intelligent people knowingly sticking their feet into bear traps, and that's what we have here. THE DEBT's biggest failing is the moral relativism of its characters. Dr. Vogel is the only character who seems to have the courage of his convictions, however twisted they may be. What I kept asking myself as THE DEBT played out was why the three agents simply didn't kill Vogel after their first botched extraction attempt. In the end, their lie, made true, would have been a better resolution than the self-imposed unresolvable ethical morass in which they lived their lives.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E21MHEC1AXY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y5H4Y8#wasThisHelpful","R1E21MHEC1AXY3","AGKPTMTR3UX1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGKPTMTR3UX1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, ""Sword and Sorcery,"" by creating The Lord of the Rings, and that fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into that genre. In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls. The good Professor, an Oxford Don whose specialty was Philology, would be proud of Ms. Kerr, who puts her own fascinating and lively spin on the old myths.The prolific Katharine Kerr taps into the ancient Celtic traditions to create the world of Annwn (literally meaning ""Nowhere"" in Welsh), an incredibly detailed, incredibly graphic land of the imagination filled with lost mountains, far valleys, and towns and villages whose denizens, most unknowingly, exist in a world filled with ""Dweomer.""""Dwimmer,"" meaning ""magic"" or ""sorcery,"" is an ancient English word, probably derived from the original Brythonic language spoken by the Celtic Britons in pre-Roman times.

""Weird"" is a modern English word which means ""bizarre,"" but it derives from the earlier word ""weirding,"" a term applied to occultists who were supposedly able to alter fate.In keeping with ancient Celtic beliefs, Kerr crafts her epic in the form of an Eternal Knot. Theoretically, every tale she tells is the beginning, the middle, and the ending of the story, so that beginning the series with Days of Air and Darkness, book number eight, (alternatively titled A TIME OF JUSTICE in Great Britain) should bring you to DAYS OF BLOOD AND FIRE.Though DAYS OF BLOOD AND FIRE is book three of ""The Westlands Cycle,"" the second cycle in the fifteen book Deverry saga, it's very clear that Kerr was uncertain what direction the saga was to take at this point. DAYS OF BLOOD AND FIRE is book number seven in the saga, and in one of the blurbs is described as ""the first book in a new trilogy."" Is there a trilogy hidden within the quindecimal saga? The hidden trilogy's name ultimately became the book's alternate U.K. title, A TIME OF WAR.DAYS OF BLOOD AND FIRE's formatting differs from the rest of the saga to this point as well, since the book is divided into numbered chapters titled, strangely enough, given Deverrian antipathy to the 'Rhwmanes,' in Latin.Kerr's representational humans are descendants of European Continental Celts (Gauls), an historic people made up of numerous tribes who were decimated and dominated by the Roman legions commanded by Julius Caesar, circa 50 B.C. According to Kerr's mythology, the tribe living in the invented Gaulish Kingdom Devetia Riga was somehow magically transported to Annwn, where they established the Kingdom of Deverry.The Deverry books concern the life stories of Jill, the heroine of the saga. What Jill does not know is that her life is inextricably bound up with that of the Dweomermaster Nevyn. Long ago, Nevyn was once Galrion, a Prince of the Realm, but youthful impetuosity led to his exile, and more importantly, to the deaths of several innocent people including his royal fiancee, the Princess Brangwen, who is now reincarnated as Jill. Brangwen's tragic death caused Nevyn to take a rash vow---to live until he had undone all the wrong he'd caused. As DAYS OF BLOOD AND FIRE opens, Jill is at the peak of her powers as the greatest human Dweomermaster.Kerr tells the long tale of Brangwen and Galrion in what amounts to a series of short novelettes-within-the-Deverry-novels, which now number fifteen. Along the way, Kerr fleshes out her colorful, lively universe, which is populated not only by the Deverrians, but by Elves and Dwarves, among many other beings.DAYS OF BLOOD AND FIRE is, like The Dragon Revenant, a story told entirely in the ""present"" without the preincarnation flashbacks or reincarnation flashforwards typical of the saga. Kerr's characters are born, die, and are reborn time and time again, as they work out their incredibly complex interlinked karmic ""Wyrds"".Despite some flaws, DAYS OF BLOOD AND FIRE is a tightly-written, exciting and enjoyable, internally consistent and intricately detailed story written in a highly cinematic style that Kerr makes her own.As for the flaws, let us just say that Kerr is not a great stylist, but she's a damn good straight-on storyteller. Her failings as an authorial stylist become more evident in DAYS OF BLOOD AND FIRE. An attentive reader, particularly one who is reading the books in sequence, will discover descriptive paragraphs spotted here and there that were lifted whole from earlier volumes. And while a description of a Dweomer technique, for example, might not really change from book to book, Kerr would have been a bit more respectful of her audience if she took that little bit of extra time necessary in this vast and sweeping epic to reorder sentences or replace an adjective or two. Still, all in all, its a failing many readers might not notice at all.Additionally, Kerr's introductions of new characters, and particularly new races, always seem to have an odd sense of afterthought about them, and in DAYS OF BLOOD AND FIRE, she drops an entirely new world on us with little foreshadowing (another indication that she had reached an undecided turning point in the saga). The book opens with our introduction to Jahdo Ratter, a boy of the Rhiddaer, a land roughly adjacent to Deverry's Arcodd Province, and populated by the descendants of Deverrian serfs who fled the kingdom during the Time of Troubles.And so, vertiginously, we suddenly discover that 'Taer Angwidd,' the presumptively empty northern 'Unknown Land' on Deverry maps, is teeming with very nearby humans, dwarven metropoli, dragons, and the fascinating race of the horsekin, troll-like humanoids who have the psychic ability to communicate with horses (much like the not-quite human Lord Perryn of an earlier episode).The horsekin (whose name reminds me, I apologize, of a vestigial body part), are divided into the Gel Da'Thae, a cosmopolitan race, and the ""wild"" horsekin of the plains, called Meradan (demons) or ""The Hordes"" by the Elves, and who behave like the Mongols' Golden Horde of old.DAYS OF BLOOD AND FIRE continues the uninterrupted story of Princess Carramaena begun in the epilogue to A Time of Omens. Carramaena is the human wife of the Elven Prince Daralanteriel. She is pregnant with their child, the soul of whom belongs to one of the members of the race known as The Guardians. Facing extinction in their alternate dimension, The Guardians have decided to attempt to be born into the world of matter and form.Not all Guardians want to share this fate, and one, Alshandra, has appeared to Men and Horsekin as a goddess, demanding that Carramaena be killed. Carramaena and her unborn child are now trapped in the besieged Deverrian city of Cengarn. The only way to lift the siege of Cengarn is for Rhodry Maelwaedd to seek out and form an alliance with the dragon Arzosah Sothy Lorezohaz.Rhodry continues what has become an ongoing character metamorphosis: Once Rhodry Maelwaedd, a human ruler, he was exiled by his brother. Becoming Rhodry of Aberwyn, a mercenary Silver Dagger, he was ultimately captured by his enemies and enslaved, with the name Taliaesyn. Rescued from slavery, he discovered his Elven roots as Rhodry ap Devaberiel. He has now become allied with the Dwarves who give him yet another new name, Rori, and set his feet on the path to finding the dragon.If you haven't read Katharine Kerr's ""Deverry"" books, you will find that very, very unlike Tolkien's Middle Earth, Annwn is rather tumbledown and casually violent. The stink of horse manure fills the air of the towns, roadside inns crawl with lice, ale, the universal drink, is dipped from open barrels (flies and all), drunken men with swords go to war over herds of pigs and cows or an inflated sense of ego disguised as honor, rape and robbery are commonplace, illegitimate children, though scorned, are ubiquitous, and the Deverrian tongue is replete with curses, most of which cannot be reprinted here.

"For starters, both Madking and I want to tell you that this item was sent to me for free in exchange for my honest review. Now that we have that out of the way, I can tell you that all of the feedback I have is positive!They give a nice warm light, similar to incandescent, perhaps a slight greenish cast. Madking says they are 50W equivalent, and I think that's correct. They are just a bit less bright than the 60W incandescent or the 14W CFL to which I compared. Like incandescent bulbs and unlike CFLs, they come to maximum brightness immediately.In use, they get warm but not hot. I could still grasp the bulb with my bare hand after it had been on for 15 minutes.They are sensibly packaged in a protective plastic clamshell which fits snugly in its cardboard box.The glass bulb is clear, so I think these would be most appropriate in applications where they will not be seen directly, like in a lamp where they would be hidden by a lampshade or frosted glass.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJ8X49JH865P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R95WXHW#wasThisHelpful","R1SJ8X49JH865P","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For starters, both Solememo and I want to tell you that this item was sent to me for free in exchange for my honest review. Now that we have that out of the way, I can tell you that most of the feedback I have is positive. I love these!For the last eight months or so, my ""go to"" headphones have been the Koss Pro4S Full Size Studio Headphones, Black with Silver Trim. I'm not going to tell you that the Solememo are as good as those, but they put in a very credible performance. They can't go way down into the low bass frequencies or way up into the high treble nearly as well as the Koss can, but they do a pretty reasonable job, I think. And they are bright and faithful in the midrange. They are very decent and quite clear. I've used them for both classical music and some pop mixed in as well. In the orchestral pieces, I found that on certain recordings, the SE09's could make the trebles a little shrill. Not terrible, but definitely noticeable. In addition to music, I've also listened to a couple of hours of an audiobook and found their performance on that assignment quite good.Combine all this with their ""go anywhere, do anything,"" capability and I think they are winners. I like to walk a mile or two every day. I wouldn't try to do that with full size headphones, but it's no challenge for these. They stay put comfortably and are are just unobtrusive enough so that you don't look like a Space Ranger, yet folks will know you're listening to something and won't try to start a conversation with you while you have these on.I encountered a small problem pairing them with my Motorola Moto G2. I noticed that the Moto was trying to pair the SE09's with another set of BT headphones (which were power off) that I'd been using. This prevented the smartphone from connecting. Once I told it to forget the other pair, these paired up immediately. The Solememo's will tell you when you've powered on and they'll tell you when you've connected to Bluetooth. I mean that literally. The headset says, ""Power on,"" and ""Your headset is connected,"" at the appropriate times, as well as ""Power off,"" when you shut them down.The internal rechargeable battery has good capacity. I've used these for about five hours so far, and they're still on their initial charge, but I'm getting ""battery low,"" from the headset voice.But, for me, the best part is how comfortable these are. I have used quite a few different earbuds, both wired and BT, and after about 40 minutes max I have to take them off because of ear discomfort. This is the first set I've ever owned that I was able to wear for extended amounts of time!Control placement is good. I was able to adjust them in my ears without accidentally pressing buttons--a problem I have had with others. Changing volume, pausing and resuming is easy and the on/off is out of the way, so you're not hitting it accidentally.If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, I'd give these a 4 1/2, the 1/2 star deduction for the slightly screechy treble. However, I can't do that so I'm rounding up to a 5 on the strength of their extraordinary and very welcome comfort. I have other earbuds that sound a little better, but I'll be using these from now on because perfectly flat audio response means little if your ears hurt.This is a fine product for what it is--an inexpensive way to enjoy your audio entertainment while you get your exercise. If you're up for some serious music appreciation, then sit yourself down on a comfortable easy chair, get out your expensive, over-the-ear studio headphones and enjoy. If, however, you also need to get a little physical activity, then you're going to have to make some concessions. With these Solememo SE09's, the concessions will be easier to take than the exercise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QB5848SOC1BV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010URT6VQ#wasThisHelpful","R1QB5848SOC1BV","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an attractive and useful group of five cooking tools designed for use with cookware having nonstick surfaces. They are large and hefty but have good balance with a comfortable grip and are a pleasure to use. On my kitchen scale, each weighs between 5 and 5 1/2 ounces. For comparison, my plastic Farberwares are under an ounce and half each!What makes these unique is that they have a stainless steel bracket (I'd call it a stand) about midway along the handle that will keep the business end of the utensil off your kitchen counter or stovetop when you set it down. It can still drip, but it's not going to come in contact with anything before you use it again with whatever you're cooking. I like that--no kitchen cleaners in the Pasta Sauce.I've used the spatula most often and have run it through the dishwasher four or five times. It cleans up nicely and suffers no damage. I've also used the solid and slotted spoons a few times each. I can detect no damage to my Calphalon and Anolon nonsticks whatsoever. Given that these tools are made by Silverstone, this is unsurprising.My worry here is that the metal bracket could come in contact with the nonstick surface during use. If you were to drop the spatula, for instance, while flipping your ""over easy,"" it's not impossible that the stainless steel piece could mar the pan's surface. But they are so comfortable and easy to hold that this doesn't seem like much of a possibility.Another minor concern is that the metal bracket prevents these utensils from nesting together in a compact way. If you store your kitchen tools in a canister or similar kind of container rather than hanging them, they will require more space than their more conventional counterparts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H2ZAVPS45F5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UD6YFKW#wasThisHelpful","R1H2ZAVPS45F5J","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fine product. Unfortunately, the packaging is not very good. I notice that many of the other Amazon reviewers did not receive a lid, rendering the can useless. I was lucky--I got all the necessary parts. In my case, however, there was no printed material in the box--no instructions, no warranty card, nothing. The cardboard shipping box in which the Step Can arrived was too flimsy for the weight of the thing and had partially opened up. My paperwork probably escaped when that happened. I was able to work out how to assemble and use it by going to simplehuman's website and looking at the product videos available for this unit.I find it to be a very well-made and well conceived item. The lid consists of two parts: A sort of ""collar"" that fits over the can and hides and secures the top of the trash bag that you've wrapped over the can's top edge, and the flip-up lid enclosed inside that collar. The lid is piston-damped. You open it by stepping on the pedal. When you release the pedal, instead of just falling on to the top of the can, the piston closes it slowly and noiselessly. The arrangement of the lid inside the collar also means that the can requires no additional clearance from the wall. You can push it into a corner as far as it will go and the lid will still be able to move through its range unimpeded. Mine is 24 3/4 inches tall with the lid closed. Add another 10 inches for the lid open. It's 18 1/2 inches wide, 12 3/4 inches deep.It's all very stable. Stepping on the pedal causes absolutely no movement of the can other than the lid raising. It seems very durable.It has a compartment into which you can stow a supply of simplehuman's trash bags. They provide you with a starter pack of their ""Code K"" bags and they are as high quality as the Step Can. They are very strong, not clingy and they are easy to use. Unfortunately, they are a little too pricey for me--23 bucks for 60 bags. The Target Tall Kitchen Bags that I'd been using with my old Rubbermaid Trash Can fit perfectly, are more economical and are strong enough, I think. (Although, as another reviewer has pointed out, the interior of the can has nooks and crannies and if a bag were to leak, clean-up might be difficult.) I can't store the Target bags in the can's built-in compartment, but I don't find that a serious drawback.I don't know who is responsible for the poor quality packaging, Amazon or simplehuman. Partly for that reason, I make no star-rating deduction for the flimsy box and partly for the fact that the product itself (if you have all the parts) is excellent and I'm glad to own it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHLKPEABHJTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUB7FHO#wasThisHelpful","R2RHLKPEABHJTN","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prior to receiving this lamp, I had been using Globe Electric 52061 Swing Arm Clip Lamp, Black, a similar ""Architect"" style desk lamp. I purchased that one because I wanted a desk lamp that would not take up space on my desk and that I could elevate high enough so that it would cast useful light on a large area of my desk. That lamp satisfied both requirements. This one does, as well, and then some!I have it clamped to the middle of the back edge of my desk. The clamp is very solid and steady and the the lamp can be locked into it, so that it won't accidentally lift it out while its position is being adjusted. Thanks to the long swing arms, I am able to have the lamp set up so that the vertical distance from the surface of my desk up to the 22 watt circular fluorescent bulb (75-100w equivalent) is about 28 inches. The bulb is centered over my desk, about 15 inches in from its back edge. This arrangement allows me to have bright, useful illumination for the entire surface of the desk (which is 28"" deep and 64"" wide).My PC keyboard, the printer, the phone and the area where I write with pen and paper are all very well lit. I have the shade tilted backward slightly so that the light from the bulb doesn't go directly into my eyes as I work. I also have tilted it slightly away from the PC's LCD screen to avoid reflections there. The upper arm and the bulb holder both have a mechanism that allows me to lock them into place so they won't shift, even if I bump into the lamp.If this fixture were no more than that, I'd be satisfied.

When I need to thread a needle or tighten the tiny screws in the hinges of my reading glasses or read small print, it is a welcome aid to my tired old eyes.This was the perfect solution for me. The lamp is well-made and seems durable.One additional note: This lamp comes with the bulb in place and connected but with loose foam pads behind the bulb which, I presume, are there to protect it during shipping.

"For starters, both Mengo and I want to say that this item was sent to me for a nominal amount for reviewing purposes and that I was open to both positive and negative feedback regarding the product. Now that we have that out of the way, I can tell you that most of the feedback I have is positive. I love these!For the last eight months or so, my ""go to"" headphones have been Koss Pro4S Full Size Studio Headphones, Black with Silver Trim. I'm not going to tell you that the Bumps are as good as those, but they put in a very credible performance. They can't go way down into the lower bass frequencies or way up into the high treble as well as the Koss can, but they do a pretty reasonable job, I think. And they are bright and faithful in the midrange. They are just surprisingly decent and quite clear. In addition to pop and classical music, I've also listened to an hour or so of an audiobook and found their performance on that assignment equally good.Combine all this with their ""go anywhere, do anything,"" capability and I think they are winners. I like to walk a mile or two every day. I wouldn't try to do that with full size headphones, but it's no challenge for the Bumps. They stay put comfortably and are are just unobtrusive enough so that you don't look like a Space Ranger, yet folks will know you're listening to something and won't try to start a conversation with you while you have these on. That was an issue for me when I did my walks with conventional wired earbuds. I'd have to yank them out of my ears to catch what was left of the first sentence spoken to me.Pairing was no problem at all. The Bumps will tell you when you've powered on and they'll tell you when you've connected to Bluetooth. I mean that literally. The headset says, ""Power on,"" and ""Connected,"" at the appropriate times, as well as ""Power off,"" and a couple of other phrases.The internal rechargeable battery has good capacity. I've used the Bumps for about three to four hours so far, and they're still on their initial charge.I have two minor quibbles. First, I wish that the semi-rigid neckband was just a tiny bit longer. It felt like it was pulling the earbuds backwards a bit when I had them comfortably seated in my ears. I had to really push it under my hair in the back to give myself enough slack. Maybe I have a big head, but I see others making similar comments, so perhaps Mengo could give us another half inch to work with when they make Rev. A.Second, every time I'd touch the earphones to put them on or adjust them, I would inadvertently press one of the buttons. There isn't much room for Mengo to work with on this. After all, you want the earpieces to remain small, but perhaps a guard or a ridge around the buttons so that a more deliberate press is required is called for. If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, I'd deduct that much for these two issues, but they are not worth a full star penalty.This is a fine product for what it is--a way to enjoy your audio entertainment while you get your exercise. If you're up for some serious music appreciation, then sit yourself down on a comfortable easy chair, get out your expensive, studio, over-the-ear headphones and enjoy. If, at the same time, you also need to get a little exercise, then you're going to have to make some concessions. With these Mengo Bumps, the concessions will be relatively small.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2REA4ZQ717J01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQ1ASUW#wasThisHelpful","R2REA4ZQ717J01","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My home was built in the '70s and all of its hinges squeak. Storm door, front door, kitchen cabinets, bi-fold doors in front of the washer and dryer, and so forth. It was a symphony of creaks and squawks around here. Until I got a can of this product!I have always preferred ""dry"" lubricants over regular lubricating oil. I think they attract less dirt and dust and are not affected if exposed to the elements--cold in particular. It used to be that you'd get a flexible tube of graphite particles and you'd ""puff"" them on to their target by squeezing the tube sharply. This dry lube works differently. It's wet!The lubricant particles are suspended in a volatile liquid which allows you to spray them where you need them. Then the liquid evaporates quickly, leaving behind just the dry lubricant.The stuff worked great! All squeaks have been silenced and all hinges move as though they were ball-bearings. I keep accidentally slamming my kitchen cabinet doors because they now move so freely!You must shake the can vigorously before you spray in order to suspend the dry lubricating particles in the liquid propellant. It has a metal ball inside to facilitate this process. It comes with a thin tube that you can plug into the spray nozzle in order to accurately direct the spray. The tube then stores in a groove in the cap. It's a little ungainly there, I would have preferred to be able to store it along the side of the can, but that's just a quibble.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0X5FZ9FED8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R18XU7E#wasThisHelpful","R1K0X5FZ9FED8J","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using TP-Link networking equipment on my home network for the last few years. I have the TL-WDR4300 Wireless N750 Dual Band Router and the TL-WDN3200 N600 Dual Band Wireless USB Adapter on my Vista machine. I tested this Adapter on my Win8.1 machine which has a built-in Realtek 802.11ac networking card, so I'd be able to make head-to-head comparisons. I transferred several 5+ gigabyte files back and forth via WiFi from my NAS and compared times. In all the tests I made, the TP-Link performed at about 96% to 98% of the speed of the built in Realtek. Pretty respectable performance, I think, considering that you just plug the TP-Link into a USB port and never have to open the PC's case.I have one additional observation that I think may be helpful. As I said, I've been using TP-Link USB adapters for several years. I did have a different TP-Link USB adapter fail on me. I was using it with the supplied USB cable, rather than plugging it directly into the PC's USB connector and I think that this may have been the root cause of the failure. The adapter gets hot when in use. If it's plugged directly into your PC, it likely will have good air flow on all four sides so the heat can dissipate. If you're using it with the cable, you will probably lay the thing down on your desk, as I did, thereby impeding airflow and potentially causing an overheat.In the month I've been testing this adapter I've had no issues of any kind--no disconnects, no crashes, nothing. I'm very impressed with TP-Link. I think they make excellent gear at very reasonable prices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3636Z04KY0B3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZRVY12#wasThisHelpful","R3636Z04KY0B3Q","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice, good-looking set of Bath Mats. They are soft and plush and stay put with a non-skid backing. I have the larger one in front of the tub/shower and the smaller in front of the sink/vanity.Since so many of the negative reviews here concentrate on the way these shed in the washer and dryer, I decided to launder them after only a few days of use to see just how bad the problem was. I washed on gentle cycle in cold water. There was some shedding, but nothing too terrible. Drying on low heat was another issue entirely. After just a few minutes, the lint screen was covered with a thick mass of fibers. I cleaned that off and restarted. Checking again after a few minutes, I found the same situation. I cleaned again, but found the same situation again in 10 minutes.The last job my old GE dryer ever performed was drying these mats. Afterwards, I discovered that, though it continued to tumble, the dryer no longer heated up. Now, I don't know if this breakdown would have occurred no matter what I was drying--the dryer was an old dinosaur manufactured circa 1970--but I'm skeptical about coincidences. I think the heavy build up of material on the lint screen caused the old fellow to suicide by overheating. Because of the uncertainty about cause and effect, however, I'm averaging a 5-star ""these look great"" review and a 1-star ""appliance killer"" review.From now on, I will just vacuum these like area rugs when they need cleaning.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AD27P67UTXQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFX6ZEW#wasThisHelpful","R1AD27P67UTXQG","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When the cable that came with my used iPod touch 4G began to malfunction--it would charge, but not sync--I began to search for a replacement. An OEM Apple cable is ridiculously expensive. There are some very inexpensive USB to 30-pin cables, but the reviews for those tend to cast doubt on their reliability. This one, I thought, had the right balance of reasonable price and good reviews.It has functioned perfectly in the few weeks that I've owned it. My original cable probably stopped working due to an internal short. The area around the strain-relief (the collar where the cable emerges from the plug) at both ends had really broken down and gotten frayed, probably the result of the prior owner pulling on the cable instead of the plug to unplug it.

"I like oatmeal and will often make a pot of McCann's which stores well in the refrigerator and provides me with breakfasts and/or snacks for days.

No, it's not the same, but it suffices.

First is price. I don't base my reviews on price because it can and does fluctuate, sometimes wildly, over time. Furthermore, what I might consider expensive you might not and vice-versa. However, at their current price these will set you back about a buck per 1/3 ounce bag. That's too rich for my tastes and I would not likely buy them for that reason (I was provided with mine for free by Amazon's Vine Program).Secondly, these are made in China. You know, land of melamine cat food. Remeber all that? To their credit, the manufacturer doesn't try to hide this fact and is quick to point out that these are, ""processed in freeze dried facilities that are U.S. FDA-registered and Internationally-certified (HACCP) which is a third party audit regulator,"" and that, ""they are also routinely tested independently by FDA certified labs in the United States.""

Then about 18 months ago, I moved and as a sort of joking housewarming gift a friend gave me some Bounty paper towels. What a revelation!

I have a Polder freestanding paper towel holder and the rolls fit fine.

"This is a stainless steel and plastic electric kettle that will boil water in amounts ranging from 0.75L (25 oz) to 1.7L (57 oz). It has a sensor which, when the water has come to a full, rolling boil, turns the kettle off with an audible click. It has a comfortable, ""stay-cool"" handle as well as a translucent plastic water gauge to make it possible to know how much water it contains. It has a lid that flips open to make filling easy.The electrical cord plugs in to a base which is entirely separate from the kettle itself. You place the kettle on the base, turn it on by depressing a large plastic switch lever on the kettle and wait patiently.If I put the minimum amount of cold tap water into the Hamilton Beach, its auto-shutoff will trigger in just about 4 minutes. Repeating the experiment (after the kettle has cooled) with the maximum amount of cold tap water, results in a time to shutoff of 7 1/2 minutes.Three minor quibbles: I wish the minimum was less than it is, so I could boil just enough water for a single mug of tea--say, 10 or 12 ounces. I also find the positioning of the water gauge, beneath the handle, a little inconvenient to see. Lastly, if you fill the kettle to the maximum, when the boil is complete, the handle (particularly near the top) does get a little warm, but not enough to burn you or be bothersome. If I could deduct a half star from my rating for those combined shortcomings, I would.

"About 18 months ago, I moved into a new place with an old GE electric stove in it. The stove works well, but the top surfaces of the coil heating elements are uneven. A heavy pan presses down on them and flattens them out so I get even heat, but my old Farberware 7-inch skillet, at 14 ounces, wasn't up to the task. The Anolon weighs 27.5 ounces and has no trouble with this assignment.Cooking performance is wonderful. Nice even heat with no hot spots. The interior is so nonstick, that a fried egg placed in the center of the pan will slide to one side if the oven isn't level! Handle is comfortable and stays cool.You have to hand wash it, but cleanup is a breeze. Nothing sticks. I've had mine for 3 months and use it at least two or three times a week, but it still looks brand new, inside and out. I'm always entertained by the fact that the interior is so slippery that when I rinse it, I don't have to dry it, because even water doesn't stick to it!I noticed when I got mine that there was some variation in the color of the interior nonstick surfacing.

"I read the reviews for this before I purchased it (as I always do), including those that remarked that, when loaded up, it's somewhat unstable. I thought that perhaps if I put my 12 inch cast iron skillet (which weighs as much as a battleship) on the bottom, that would anchor the thing and keep it stable. No such luck.It leans slightly when loaded up--the back of the bottom is against the wall of a cabinet, the back of the top leans out about 5/8 inch away from that wall. That's the extent of the tilt.I'm not dissatisfied with it. It does the job and it's not like the thing is in any danger of toppling over. The pans don't fall out because of the tilt, there's no side-to-side tilt and I've had no problems of any kind with it after about 2 months of use.In fact, in all other respects, it's perfect. The shelf spacing is generous, the shelves are sturdy, removing and replacing pans is easy and the flat top shelf accommodates a small covered saucepan quite nicely, just as the product photo shows. I would recommend that you arrange your pans from heaviest to lightest as you go from bottom to top.

It's comfortable to wear and keeps my ears happy and warm. I have kind of a big head and when I first got this it felt a little tight, but through subsequent wearings, it seemed to loosen up just a bit and now it fits perfectly. I wear it as shown in the product picture with a ""cuff"" at the bottom as opposed to ""gangsta"" style where you just pull it down as far as it will go so you look like a doofus.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDN18CMF4TYSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008737R12#wasThisHelpful","RDN18CMF4TYSI","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been dieting--either to lose weight or maintain it--for the last several years. I count calories and, in order to that effectively, I weigh everything I eat. I have tried a number of digital food scales during this time, and this Escali is, hands down, my favorite.It has many virtues. It's accurate. It can weigh in grams, ounces or pounds+ounces at the push of a button and can switch between them while weighing. It has a large, easy to read LCD display. It can weigh up to 11 pounds. It has a generous auto-shutoff that resets its timer if the weight changes, so it will never cut off in the middle of weighing something. It can work with negative weight, so you can zero the scale with a container full of something and then remove the amount you want. It can measure to the nearest 0.05 ounce, so if you want 2 3/4 ounces, you can get 2.75 instead of 2.6 or 2.7 ounces like many other food scales. It runs on ordinary AA batteries and you can use rechargeables if you like. It is quite durable. Mine is 3 years old and going strong.I see that some folks are saying that you have to use small plates on the scale's platform so as not to block the readout, but I find that it's very easy to use a dinner plate and just slide it back until I can see the LCD. The Escali's weighing platform is large enough that the plate won't topple over. Another complaint I see here is that it's hard to turn off. That's ""user error,"" I think. You turn it off by pressing and HOLDING the on/off button for a couple of seconds. It will turn off. However, if you've just zeroed the scale a second ago by pressing briefly on the on/off and then try this procedure, it won't. I think that's where the confusion comes from.The issue described in the number one review concerning the scale automatically resetting its zero-point if you add very small increments of weight very slowly after setting it to zero is correct. If I ""tare"" the scale and then keep adding one popcorn kernel every few seconds, I can sneak several grams of them on to the scale without it registering a weight change. In practice I've never found this to be a problem. Once the weight is non-zero, this no longer occurs. So, if you wanted to weigh out, say, 25 grams of popcorn, you would begin by pouring 10 or 15 grams worth on to the scale to start, and from there, you're fine. You can then add one kernel at a time (if you are very patient) and you'll eventually get to a completely accurate 25 grams.It cleans up well, but you can't wash it in the sink. It isn't waterproof and if you run water on the thing it will get into the electronics and it won't turn on anymore. However, I did this once and found that if I just let it sit and dry out for a few days, it came back to life, as good as always!Dieting is hard. The Escali is not. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E55UBEF9MN3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007GAWSC#wasThisHelpful","R1E55UBEF9MN3F","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this Carrying Case just about 2 years ago for my Garmin 50LM. I don't like to leave my GPS in the car, so when I return home I put it into this case and carry it into the house, and the next time I need to use my GPS to drive somewhere, I take it with me.In the meantime, the case protects the 50LM's screen and offers a bit of protection for the unit. It's not so heavily padded or armored that it would protect my Garmin if I were to drop it, but it does allow me to stuff the thing into a coat pocket or a briefcase or a bag of groceries and not worry about scratching the screen or otherwise damaging it.It has held up quite well. In the 2 years that I've owned it, I've used it to round-trip to the car and then back inside at the very least 200 times, and it still looks brand new--both the case and the Garmin. I've owned several Amazon Basics products and find them to be the perfect combination of value and quality.

"I've owned several Amazon Basics products and I find them to be a perfect balance of value and quality.

All 4 devices powered up instantly without issues and all continue to work, with much daily use and without further recharging, a month later.The pair that went into the flashlight are most indicative of the quality of these batteries, I think.

"For the last few years, I've been weighing my food at every meal in order to either lose weight or maintain it. I have owned several digital food scales during this time. This one stacks up pretty well against the others. Its virtues are well documented in the other reviews here, but I'd like to mention a few weaknesses that I don't see mentioned often or at all.First, the scale is a little slow to react. If you are gradually adding food in small increments (like, say, popcorn kernels) you will overshoot your target weight unless you stop after each addition and wait for the Taylor to react. All food scales suffer from this to a certain extent, but it seems particularly noticeable with the 3842.Secondly, The LCD is not sealed waterproof. On two occasions, I accidentally spilled a little liquid on it, and in both cases that liquid found its way underneath the plastic covering of the LCD. A food scale is going to be used in a wet environment and this flaw is unacceptable.Lastly, although I love the glass platform, it is not removable for cleaning. You must clean it in place. If I could detach it from the body of the scale, I could just wash it under running water in the sink, like a dish. Unfortunately, that's not possible.I've deducted a star for the combination of these three shortcomings. Otherwise, accuracy, convenience, ease of use, the Taylor 3842 is a winner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NWOSXS5G9KL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDS2X2G#wasThisHelpful","R1NWOSXS5G9KL","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Logitech keyboards and mice for the last decade. I like how they just work and I've never had a problem with installation--until the MX800 combo. The keyboard was fine, but the mouse would not ""pair"" with Logitech's Setpoint software. Fortunately, I had the brainstorm to check the Amazon reviews for such a problem and see if anyone had worked out a solution for it. I found the answer in a review by Lawrence C Reardon posted on 3/28/2014. You just have to ""unpair"" the keyboard using Setpoint. Then the mouse will pair immediately and you can pair the keyboard again. It's just my guess, but based upon other reviews describing this situation, I think it may be a problem with old Logitech drivers already existing on the target machine and getting in the way.Once everything was working, I found much to like. I have the wired Logitech Illuminated Keyboard on my other machine and love it. The MX800, because it's wireless and therefore battery powered, only lights up when your hands approach it and then remains lit while you type. I slightly prefer the wired version because I don't like the illumination switching on and off, but it is still a very appealing feature to my old eyes. I'd be happier if I could just have the illumination on constantly, and I'd be happy to recharge more often for that luxury. At the very least, I'd like to be able to set the delay interval for the keyboard turning off its illumination once I've stopped typing. Strangely, I can do that only if I turn off ""Activate illumination with hand detection,"" but I like that feature and don't want to disable it. If Amazon allowed half-star deductions, I'd use that feature for this shortcoming, but I don't think it's worth a whole star.The mouse can track on any surface (I have mine on a wooden desk) and is on a par with other Logitech mice I have used. It has a multitude of buttons, which are programmable as long as you have Logitech's downloadable Setpoint software installed.Both mouse and keyboard come equipped with rechargeable batteries which can be recharged by means of a USB cable (included) without removing them from their respective devices.I've deducted a star for the installation woes which had me saying words that I wouldn't want small children to hear. The combo, once working, is a five-star product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKMLLIQRFX8VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I14395A#wasThisHelpful","RKMLLIQRFX8VZ","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these headphones quite a lot.I'm not an ""audiophile,"" and I don't know if there's anything to the headphone ""break-in"" argument or not. I've had these for about a month, I use them daily to listen to music of all kinds as well as the spoken word. I guess a total of about 25 or 30 hours of use all told. I also played a pink noise loop through them when I wasn't using the PC for anything else. Perhaps an additional 20 hours there. Everything seems clear and undistorted with no break up or rattling at high or low frequenciesThe Adaros are not noise-cancelling headphones, but the soft leather ear cups do a very good job of sealing out the rest of the world so nothing interferes with whatever you're listening to. I liked that they seemed to give a very flat response across the audio spectrum. The last pair of headphones that I owned sounded like they had a built-in ""loudness filter"" that artificially hyped the treble and bass and I was always fiddling with a software equalizer to try to remove that. With these, I use the equalizer to just tweak the sound to my liking.The Adaros seem well-made. They are very comfortable to wear and feather-light (6.9 ounces on my kitchen scale). Unlike other headphones I've seen, they are understated and unobtrusive in appearance--flat black with a Razer logo on the outside of the ear cups. However, the audio cable is a bright, neon green.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZBVX13KX6UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4XMJ22#wasThisHelpful","R3FZBVX13KX6UU","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a ""walker"" for the last 10 or 12 years. I started for health reasons, but it has become an essential part of my daily routine and now I find that I just don't feel right without a couple of miles every day on my Rockports.Walkers come in two subspecies: step-counters and distance-speed trackers. I belong to the latter group. I've owned a couple of pedometers but my preference now is to use Google's MapMyWalk website to calculate my mileage. You just put down mouse clicks on a street or satellite map and Google accurately calculates the distance using its GPS data. If you've taken notice of your start and end times, you can figure out your speed.The problem with accuracy when using devices like the Omron is twofold. First, it has to count your steps. This it does by sensing slight shifts in inertia as you walk. Some pedometers are more accurate than others at achieving this, but there is always some degree of error. Secondly, to compute total distance walked the device relies on its user to correctly tell it his or her stride length. If the value given is off by even a slight amount, the resultant mileage for a walk of several thousand steps can be misreported by a significant amount.I have found that the best way to deal with both these difficulties is to calibrate the pedometer by ""backing in"" to the correct mileage. That is, walk a known distance. Measure it by using MapMyWalk or by driving the route with your car and using its odometer. Then convert that distance to inches and divide by the number of steps the pedometer says you took. Input that value as your stride length. I find that this approach will cause almost any pedometer to give a decent approximation of distance covered. The Alvita will predict your stride-length based on weight and height and I found that, for me, it was spot on with its guess, and no recalibration was necessary.Ordinarily, with devices of this type, you need a very small Phillips' head screwdriver to insert or remove the battery. The Alvita has eliminated this requirement by securing its battery access cover with a small slide lock. I had no difficulties with the process. I had no problems with the belt clip or with the unit staying put. I inserted it into my belt at my side and that is where it remained. The instructions are not as clear as they could be, but you can decipher them with a little head-scratching--especially if this is not your first pedometer.I had two problems with the Alvita. Firstly, the only way to reset will take the device to its factory settings, losing all your personalized data. If you do two walks in a day, they get added together--you can't do the first, reset, and do another walk. The second is that, though it calculates distance accurately and consistently, it does not report time spent walking or speed. For me, that means I must take notice of when I start and when I finish so that i can manually calculate my speed. Other pedometers I've owned do one or both for their owners. This limitation means I get no advantage over the above-mentioned MapMyWalk method. I make no star-deduction, since these shortcomings would not be objections for step-counters--clearly the target audience for the Alvista.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T0H54OBYWKMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOGK4RG#wasThisHelpful","R3T0H54OBYWKMT","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice grab bar--strong and sturdy while still maintaining an attractive appearance. If you install it correctly, it could save you from a potentially disastrous bathroom fall.Unfortunately, the instructions for making such an installation are not very good and I've deducted a star for that weakness. Moen has chosen to provide them in three different languages, but instead of giving you three different instruction sheets, they combine them all on one sheet causing a difficult to read jumble. The diagrams, which are critical for this type of project, are worse than useless and in fact are sometimes misleading.Moen says that you must mount the grab bar so that it will be screwed into wood studs. They do not mention that they make a product for mounting their grab bars in situations where there are no convenient wall studs! I had to discover that on my own. It would have been nice had they made mention of this. It is the Moen SMA1005CH Home Care Securemount, Chrome and Amazon sells them. You Tube has a video that explains how they work and how to install them (just search for 'Moen Securemount' in the YT searchbox).

It has three different grating surfaces and a slicing surface, a comfortable, padded handle, a non-slip base so that when you place it on a cutting board it will stay put and it even comes with its own 1-cup attachable container that will catch and measure what you've grated. The container also has its own cover as well a non-slip base so that you don't lose that feature when it's positioned on the grater. It's a pleasure to use.I have one small complaint. If Amazon allowed half-star deductions, I would use that here, but it isn't serious enough for a whole star. OXO has made the grater narrow enough so that it can be easily stored in a kitchen drawer. On one narrow face is the finest of the three graters and on the other is the slicer. The problem is that other than, perhaps, carrots or parsnips, there is very little you can slice with the slicer. Even a cucumber is too wide. Potatoes are out of the question. This, I think, was a design choice. The manufacturer wanted the product to be easy to store and, apparently, decided that the slicer was likely to be infrequently used anyway, so they compromised its functionality. Since this is first and foremost, a grater and not a mandoline, I can overlook it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C0V0KV3ORCHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007VO0CQ#wasThisHelpful","R3C0V0KV3ORCHQ","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually buy the Charmin ""UltraSoft"" Mega Rolls when I need TP. I like them for their efficacy as well as their economy. This ""Basic"" Charmin compares very favorably to its brand mate.The Basic really is basic--no scents, no patterns, single ply. Yet, it's significantly better than the economy Target product I used to favor a few years ago. It's softer, stronger and at least as inexpensive. Those have got to be the primary criteria on which to rate this mundane but very necessary product. Each of these double rolls lasts about 60% as long as an Ultrasoft mega roll.The box in which the 40 rolls are shipped is surprisingly small. I was expecting a Mastodon-sized container with ""Charmin Basic Toilet Paper"" emblazoned all over it, but was pleasantly surprised. The Charmin box is just 16""x21""x9"". Your neighbors will think you got a new computer.I think that when I use these up, I will go back to the UltraSoft. It isn't quite as economical, but the small price differential is outweighed by the luxury-feel of it. That said, I don't mind having these and would switch to them if the others were to become unavailable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTT80N8F8IZIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOSANPM#wasThisHelpful","RTT80N8F8IZIX","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using these for myself. I have problems with ""dry eyes,"" and I discovered years ago that cleaning my face first thing in the morning and last thing before bedtime was very helpful in treating that annoyance. At first, I used the Cottenelle wipes, but after a month or so, I started having problems with the skin on my face, particularly my eyelids. Then I switched to Tucks, after reading that the ladies like that one for removing eye make-up and getting rid of bags under the eyes. Those worked well too but the Witch Hazel they contain, if it gets into my eyes, is very irritating so I have to be careful to keep my eyes closed and to rinse my face with warm water afterwards.Enter the Seventh Generation Wipes. They don't upset the skin and they don't sting if they get in my eyes. I'm using them for about a month now, and they seem like a great solution for me. I'm very pleased.At first, I thought they weren't sufficiently wet to do a good job, but I've changed my mind. In fact, I now think that they have *exactly* the correct amount of moisture to do their job without making the skin overly wet--whether that skin is your face or a baby's butt!Note: These are NOT flushable. Sewage treatment plants all over the US are having problems with wipes like these getting flushed and then clogging up the works. They do not break down like toilet tissue.

"I've been using Neilmed products for the last few years. I have terrible sinus problems, and a few years ago, my doctor recommended that I try Sinus Rinsing (NeilMed Sinus Rinse - 2 Bottles - 250 Premixed Packets - Value Pack) and that has made a HUGE positive difference for me. I have always found Neilmed products to be of the highest quality.When I received the Sinufrin, I found that it was wrapped in a hard plastic cocoon that was very difficult to remove. Similar products have a tear-strip to simplify removal of the shell, but the Sinufrin did not. Then when I tried the sprayer, nothing happened. I concluded that the sprayer mechanism was defective and when I contacted Amazon, they were kind enough to send me a replacement.As I struggled to remove the plastic shell from the second unit, I noticed that my fingers were getting wet. Sure enough, when I checked inside, only a small amount of liquid remained. I checked the original I'd received and found the same and then realized that the first sprayer hadn't worked because there wasn't enough fluid left inside. I combined the two in one sprayer and then had enough to make it function. I found the sprayer not to my liking, even when I made it work, despite the fact that this type of ""metered"" sprayer is my favorite. It has a ""wobbly"" feel that I don't get with the Afrin sprayers of the same type.Sinufrin's Oxymetazoline solution is 5-star and the equal of Afrin, the gold standard, in every way. My rating is based on the serious flaws in the sprayer outlined above.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJBDOOQDTL7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A5MSE2Y#wasThisHelpful","RKJBDOOQDTL7F","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As with most hardware these days, the only hard copy documentation you will receive with the Seagate Central is a Quick Start Guide which then refers you to online sources for further information. That's fine and I accept that. Unfortunately, the online information was pretty sketchy and in one case did not agree with the screens I was seeing presented to me by the hardware. The Seagate has an option to ""Reset to Factory Settings,"" which is good since I had to do that more than once until I figured out what I was supposed to do!Once I got beyond that difficulty, the Seagate Central seemed a solid performer, if a little slow. I started by creating a 1.5TB Truecrypt container file on the unit. That is a torture test for a hard drive because it is writing and accessing for the entire time (32+ hours for the Seagate Central). I believe that this speed is about 10% slower than the drives in my Netgear NAS, but is still acceptable. File transfers to and from the encrypted container have been fine since then. Those transfer speeds would be meaningless, since encryption/decryption is involved.I then put a few HD movies and YouTube videos in the Public directory of the Seagate. I have a Roku 3 in my network which, sadly, is not DLNA compatible so I couldn't test the unit's abilities as a DLNA server. I do have the MyMedia app for the Roku though, and using that was able to stream everything through to my TV. That went well--no halting or stuttering or buffering.It's a solid performer, but I find the documentation issues serious enough to deduct a star from my rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WFCE0DUYNEJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARB5FPM#wasThisHelpful","R1WFCE0DUYNEJ8","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start by saying that I love my Roku. That's why I gave it five stars. Generally, if I see that a product that I'm familiar with has a lot of reviews (2600+ as of this writing) and that the other reviewers have gotten it right (4.3 stars) I won't bother to write my own. But there are a few negatives that not too many folks here are talking about that you should know about before you purchase the Roku 3 in order to make an informed decision.First, the Search. Roku is making a lot of noise about the inclusion of this function and it is a very useful thing to have. But, its scope is very limited. When you search for a movie, it will check only the top eight services: Netflix, HBO GO, VUDU, huluplus, Amazon, Redbox, Blockbuster, and Crackle. So if one of the other 700+ channels (that Roku also likes to talk up as another incentive to buy their product) has the flick you want to see, you'll never know it. To search manually would take far longer than the running time of the movie you seek.And while we're on the subject, let's talk about all those other channels. Specifically, let's talk about the huge number of FREE ones. One of my least favorite old sayings is ""You get what you pay for."" I hate it because it denies the possibility of getting a bargain and it asserts that if you spend a lot, you'll get something good. Neither of those is valid. Unfortunately, it is largely true here. Most of the free movie channels draw on the library of films that are in the public domain. Old, mostly forgotten or unpopular entries that you'd have to be pretty desperate to consider seriously. The more modern ones are so obscure that you can't find them in IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes. There are exceptions. I found ""The Third Man,"" and ""D.O.A."" in the free channels, so there are a few good ones, but they are rare.And when you do find a treasure, you're still not out of the woods. Many of the copies of the films in the free channels look like they've been sitting under a tarp in grandma's basement for the last half century. They're not the carefully restored and remastered versions you'd get on a commercial station like TCM.One last thing to point out in regard to the free channels is that they have advertising. They have to support themselves somehow and I don't really begrudge them doing this. Furthermore, the number and duration of commercials is less than you'd get on a broadcast or cable station. But it is there and it does interrupt the flow of the film you're watching.Some of the free channels are worthwhile. NASA has a channel, Crackle has recent high-quality films from Sony, and PBS has recent shows from their catalog. But for the most part the freebies are...well...awful.Before you can truly love, you must understand the limitations and shortcomings of your beloved. Otherwise it's just infatuation. The Roku's specialty is to act as a conduit between *paid* entertainment providers and you. That's its strength and its intended purpose and it does that job very well. Fortunately, the pay channels are not very expensive. Netflix, Amazon Prime, and many of the others are less than 10 bucks a month for all you can watch. If you're already subscribed to HBO on your cable, you can get HBO GO for no additional charge and have on-demand access to all their currently playing films and shows.But, if you think that you'll just pay for the Roku box and then live together happily ever after with the free channels, I foresee an acrimonious divorce in your future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R5K0J8BSQVJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGGDVOO#wasThisHelpful","R2R5K0J8BSQVJD","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using this desktop with Windows Vista. The product was clearly intended for Windows 7 and especially Windows 8, but works well enough with Vista.The keyboard is dome-shaped and very slim. It is split in the center with the two halves pitched toward each other, so that when you place your hands on the keys, they can be in a more natural position, turned slightly toward each other with wrists rotated downward toward the outside. There is a built in wrist rest which is smooth and has just the right amount of cushioning to be comfortable but supportive. The space-bar is split as well. The keys have a sculpted, slightly convex surface to accommodate your fingertips. They have a nice amount of smooth travel and excellent ""clickiness.""The keyboard comes with a riser which fits on its wrist side. This gives it a downward tilt--exactly the opposite of most other keyboards which have fold-out feet to give an upward tilt. Its use is optional. I couldn't get used to it and don't use it.The function keys have alternate uses controlled by a slide switch on the extreme top-right of the keyboard. Most of these alternates uses are for Windows 8 functions and do nothing in Vista. There is a calculator hot key which does work in Vista.The Number Pad is a separate unit. I like this because I seldom use it and can put it out of the way and then center the keyboard more easily in front of my monitor.The mouse is significantly larger than any other mouse I've ever used. To me, it feels like holding a baseball. I think that Microsoft has done this so that they could put the thumb rest higher up on the side of the mouse than usual which, in turn, forces you to rotate your wrist slightly when mousing. It takes a bit of getting used to, but after a while begins to feel very comfortable and natural. It is a wheel mouse and features tilt-wheel functionality in addition to the standard features.If you have Windows 7 or 8, you can download the ""Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center,"" which will allow you to customize your new Desktop set.

"If you've seen this program in use and you know in advance what you will be getting, and that's what you want, then go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, exercise extreme caution. It is very powerful and capable. But it is also a very complex piece of software and not easy to learn. I tried it, decided it was several light-years beyond what I wanted, and chose to uninstall it.And that's when the fun started.Pinnacle installs about a dozen different applications when you run its installer. But when you run its uninstaller, it removes only the base application and leaves everything else on your disk--gigabytes worth of software. It took me an entire afternoon with Revo Uninstaller to get my PC back to where it had been beforehand. I had to find all the apps Pinnacle had installed, remove them one by one, and then remove *hundreds* of registry entries and *hundreds* of directories that each app's uninstaller failed to deal with. It was a nightmare and I'm still wondering what I might have missed and what will now fail to work because I deleted something I shouldn't have. It was an unmitigated disaster.I would recommend that if you decide on installing this, that you first create a Windows Restore point. Then, choose the ""Custom"" install and just do the Pinnacle application itself.

"My first reaction on seeing these was, ""Does the world really need another Chocolate Chip Cookie?"" In this case, I think the answer is yes.Keebler has tried to create cookies using only the ingredients that you would use if you were making them at home. They contain no artificial ingredients or flavorings. The result is a very appealing cookie that definitely does have a ""homemade"" taste and consistency. Most store-bought cookies I've tried have either a chewy or a crispy texture. These are buttery and delicious and have a light, slightly crumbly texture. Definitely not chewy, but not what I would call crisp either.The packaging is the new type that has a peel-up tab that self sticks to the package to reseal.

"These Keebler El Duende cookies are very much like ""Golden Oreos,"" (if you happen to be familiar with those) except that they have a mild, lemon-flavored filling instead of plain vanilla.I don't understand why so many reviewers are unhappy with the amount of filling in these. I thought it was about as much as you'd get in an Oreo. Perhaps they were comparing to Oreo's ""Double-Stuffed,"" varieties, or perhaps there is some variation on a lot-by-lot basis and I was just lucky. Otherwise I have no explanation for the dissatisfaction.The wafer part of the cookie is crispy and light and complements the filling nicely. It is, I think, a bit smaller than an Oreo. It measures 1 5/8 inches in diameter. I didn't have an Oreo in the house to compare against, but my impression is that the Nabisco product is just a bit larger.I liked these. They were sweet and lemony without being too much of either, and I would recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37V8VI1JD66U8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBSG2WI#wasThisHelpful","R37V8VI1JD66U8","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a non-refrigerated, microwaveable meal containing pasta and tomato-meat sauce. The packaging states that it is ""100% Natural"" and contains ""No Preservatives."" How Barilla is able to give us a tomato and meat sauce in liquid form but without any chemicals to keep it palatable is a mystery to me. The plasticized tray packaging is sealed tightly with a stout film cover, so I guess that's the key.The primary ingredient is Gemelli pasta which is made with Semolina wheat and Durum flour. The one portion will give you 6 grams of fiber (24% of a 2000-calorie diet). For those of us who have reached the stage of life where fiber intake is critical, this is a wonderful bonus.This is the third of these Barilla meals that I've tried. In the past, I've found the pasta a little too tough for my taste, but this time it was fine. Definitely al dente but good. I found the 1-minute cooking time to be fine.The rest of the ingredient list yields nothing suspicious other than ""Xanthan Gum,"" and ""Tapioca Starch.""The meat sauce is packaged in a separate ""Sauce Tray"" which fits in the main packaging and is microwaved with it. When heating is complete, you remove the sauce tray and pour it over the pasta. That works well. Prior to heating, you peel back the film covering over the sauce to vent the package. I had no difficulties with any of this. Just be careful to read the instructions before you do anything.The package will give you 350 calories with 6g of fat and 570mg of sodium. The sodium is high (24%) as it is in virtually all pre-packaged meals. It seems the manufacturers have learned how to control all the nutrients--calories, fat, cholesterol, carbs, everything--except salt.I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat this, but for what it is--an ultrasimple, convenient, quick meal that you could stick in your briefcase or backpack on the way out to work or school--it was pretty good. If you don't have access to a cafeteria and don't want something from the deli or the take-out or fast-food places, this is definitely a good alternative (as long as there is a microwave in the break room).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RECX5JLXDM7GZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2JRNBM#wasThisHelpful","RECX5JLXDM7GZ","A3VYKXHQDICC6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VYKXHQDICC6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I try to eat nutritiously, but I believe in moderation, so I will occasionally have a snack that is less than healthful if it has a taste I find appealing. I'm partial to beef jerky, certain types of chips and Snickers bars. Just not too often.These Slim Jims will not be joining my short-list. They are, I guess, sausages of a sort--foot long tubes about a 3/8 of an inch in diameter. The outer skin is taut and crispy. The inside is soft and somewhat mushy.They are made with beef and chicken, but there is no discernible meat flavor--just spice heat. I guess they would be a good accompaniment to a beer or two, but I can think of other things (salsa and corn chips, flavored pretzels, etc.) that I'd rather have with that beverage.Nutrition on these is hair-raising, even for a guilty pleasure. A less than one ounce snack which will deliver 140 calories, 23% of your daily allotment of saturated fat and 20% of your sodium, not to mention some nitrite--that's pretty hard-core.Sorry, Jim.

"Literary Fiction hasn't been working for me lately. Books others find exceptional I find improbable and overwritten. Crooked Heart os a lovely book about unlovely people. The small WW2 British setting adds a quiet charm to a tale of grifters conning each other. A bitter mother with a disappointing son crosses paths with a not as young as his years boy in need of additional care. Setting themselves up to take advantage of those around them, Crooked Heart shows how deeply they need to find someone to trust. Evans has a light literary style free of pretension but full of lovely phrases. There are no larger than life heroic people in Crooked Heart but there are plenty of recognizable ones.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book and I have already suggested it to several family members.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C0EWC4W8WWYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062364839#wasThisHelpful","R2C0EWC4W8WWYL","A3FG0FQHNV2UP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FG0FQHNV2UP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's long enough for the average desk setup but won't give a laptop user much flexibility.

"I'm familiar enough with college ball and the impact of the cultural changes but I am not a fan of college ball. I approached Billion-Dollar Ball wanting to understand the hows and why's of it's coming to dominate the conversation. While Gaul has extensively researched, interviewed and explored the cultural changes money has brought into the game, he fails to capitvate the non-fan. I left the book with as many questions as I entered it with, but they were different ones. Billion Dollar Ball expects a working knowledge of college football and some key figures in it. It was hard to get into the narrative of deals while also figuring out context. I continually felt that if I knew more about the subject I'd be getting more out of the book. I wanted to explore the post football lives of these kids - do they feel exploited by a for profit system they can't profit from? Was it worth it?

"As I mentioned in another volume I struggle with 1 and 5 stars. I love this incredibly unique series and the exposure it offers my whole family to modern artists. I don't mind paying a premium to support the concept and allow them to contract with diverse artists. Unfortuantely not all of these artists understand the concept of a coloring book. Some, like Shag, do a very good job of leaving lots of white space for inking. Others produce an almost entirely black page that is true to their style but useless.

"Coates writing style is engaging. The way he chronicles his internal thought and reaction process is very approachable for a white reader from different life experience. His descriptions of past events are concise and visual, easily putting the reader in the moment.  The conceit of the book is practical. What will he need to teach his son to survive without diminishing his joys. He spends a good deal of time weighing his accumulated experience of America versus a consideration of the very different experience of his son via technological and geographical differences to arrive at a strong compare / contrast without putting words in anyone's mouth but his own. Coates frequently takes pains to emphasise that his words are addressing his own lived experiences, not a global one.

"Watkins overwrites. If that's your thing, there is much to appeal in Gold Fame Citrus. If a phrase like ""the colloidal taste of hummus in her mouth"" makes you sigh, this isn't the right book.

Ig, the toddler, is a plot device rather than a fully realized character.

"Kara is an engaging, age appropriate heroine. She lacks some basic sense which is appropriate to the age and necessary for the plot. Side characters are a mix of well conceived and red herring. With a complicated backstory, decent suspense pacing and full resolution there is a lot to like in From Where I Watch You.

"I was torn between three and four stars. Goodman's book is very readable to those interested in the financial side of rock and roll but is unlikely to appeal to readers seeking out a less detailed read. Klein was a consummate hustler in an era of the same, always an angle to benefit himself. Finishing Goodman's book I understood why Klein has been so polarizing. He presented himself as a benefactor while taking what appears to be often extreme advantage of his clients. Given the absolute corruption of the industry at the time, Klein no doubt deserves more credit that he gets. While he did appropriate artist's rights he also was at the forefront of freeing those rights from the label's iron hold. His financial ideas were often innovative. Those who dislike Klein will not change their mind from this detailed look at his practices. Those to whom Klein is new will find a nuanced, occasionally favorable, look at a key figure in early rock and roll.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19XHUK0QK2VBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547896867#wasThisHelpful","R19XHUK0QK2VBL","A3FG0FQHNV2UP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FG0FQHNV2UP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I would suggest this bag for it's clear utility, great price, and sturdy construction to anyone not daunted by tackling an MC Escher quality labyrinth of zippers.  The bag packs so flat that I was at first concerned it would not be up to the challenge for which it was intended *(light weekend or multi day travel, with multiple changes of clothing and toiletry bag).  It turns out that this is the complete Jason Bourne luxury model escape kit in bag form, in fact it is entirely possible that Bourne may still be lost in it somewhere.  The staggering number of compartments and their zippers planted the idea in me that if I were ever  to start unzipping each compartment they would yield only new, more zippered compartments leaving me stranded on the precipice of a yawning nylon void, and that I may be lost in that effort never having found the end, or an exit, or perhaps just left inside a zipper edged realm questioning my place in the cosmos‚Ä¶ which in fact might also be contained inside this bag.  This is like a five legged pant.We begin fairly smoothly‚Ä¶ four securing side strap clips release the full depth of the main body, and a large double zipper opens for your basic ""place to put clothes and things"" affair.  From here our footing is less secure regarding four side pouches (open top net pouches for ‚Ä¶snack bars most likely, and long zipper sided water bottle pouches with fold over non fastening tops), a secondary main space, a zipper which releases and deploys an entirely second backpack (with airy net shoulder straps and space for pens, wallets, snacks, and microfiche).  It unzips off the back of the main bag. This new backpack nestles it's limbs and cuddles back up to the host bag fairly easily for re-zippering.  There is a pouch only available when deployed - which seems to have literally been designed to hold a passport and a sandwich close at hand.This isn't even it's final form, though.A recessed zipper panel on the underside opens to release a full backpack harness for the main pack with abdominal and shoulder cross straps.  You can either roll the cover panel up and secure it with a dedicated bottom velcro pouch, or you can let it hang free as an over exaggerated rear flap to ensure your pants (or knees or calves) never have to touch an unknown surface while sitting on public transit.In all, I packed two and a half typical bags worth of content into this bag including one of those other bags, and I think I could have worked in more if I'd taken my time.  The top carry handle is comfortable and useful when navigating airline or train seating.  I missed my typical cross shoulder strap for carry-ons, but the pang of that loss will very likely lessen in short order.Pros:  Great amount of storage, light frame while structurally sound, very versatile, amazing price.  Being larger on the inside, awesome for fans of Doctor Who.Cons:  Like the cult film House, I worried that by putting anything into it, I would have to drive to another state and break through a medicine cabinet mirror to repel into a wall and find it again.Optional ProTip:  Consider getting secondary market dedicated zipper pull adornments for each pouch, so that when someone is asking for your papers, you know to open the Hello Kitty, whereas when you are pushing off hunger, you know to grab the Casino Dice.  Otherwise you might be there all day testing zippers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10JRXSD6YJZ8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOYLCCY#wasThisHelpful","R10JRXSD6YJZ8C","A3FG0FQHNV2UP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FG0FQHNV2UP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dunaway is a fair and entertaining storyteller. I'm interested in rock history, but my knowledge of the Alice Cooper Group was minimal. Insightful, interesting and easy to read but I went with 3 stars over 4 mostly for reasons of style. The book is more a selections of moments, as many memoirs are, than a linear narrative.

"I'm conflicted about this book. Leap finds herself surprised when her perceptions of what the group will be like don't match their words or actions. On the other hand, she strives to give a clear eyed accounting of the realites of life in this community of limited opportunties. The audience for this book is likely to share many of the assumptions Leap herself makes, and therefore also find themselves surprised. In a scene where a member of the group angrily confronts a police officer who has come to speak Leap is nonplussed by other members of the group being concilatory to the officer.

Coming from a background of some ease, her early struggles will seem lighter to readers from less comfortable ones. This is not to take anything away from her hard work.

"The source material is excellent as Morias has obviously done intensive research. The perspective is fresh, as it's rare to read an english language book on Cuba not predisposed to the American point of view. Holding me back from really engaging with Morais's book is the style.

"Cole Cohen has an interesting neurological condition and she writes well when detailing the challenges she's faced before and after diagnosis. This is the rare book where I wish a third party had taken alternating chapters. Cohen's focus is naturally narrow but the telling of her life eventually becomes claustrophobic.

"There are no huge surprises in this soapy tale of two lovers meeting a their shared boyfriend's funeral. Charlie, Presumed Dead, has a number of twists along the way, but most will be spotted by fans of the Big Conspiracy YA books. Heltzel turns out a strong version, keeping her target market enthralled. Me 11 year old can't wait for a sequel. ""You will simply LOVE this book!"" Lena and Aubrey form an unlikely friendship as they travel the world trying to unravel the mystery of Charlie's death. Drug dealers,betrayal and potential danger keep them moving. A transgender character is referred to as a ""ladyboy"". This may be accurate to the country the characters are in, but it required a discussion on the term not being accepted American usage. Lena and Aubrey come across as interesting and resourceful. Definitely in for a sequel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YBHAFWOEPN58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544388496#wasThisHelpful","R2YBHAFWOEPN58","A3FG0FQHNV2UP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FG0FQHNV2UP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think the age rating on this book is a little high - I'd slate it more 4th grade to 6th. Nice collection of mild ghost stories with a class 'round the fire' format updated to include a mysterious room of strangers telling their tales. Big hit with my 11 year old - ""This book will make sure you know what story you will tell when your friends want to spook you, and it WILL backfire on the person who had the idea to start the game of stories.""

"How fun is this book?? That said, keeping me from five stars are a few slow sections, occasional slides into camp, and slips in the first person tense. (I'm not a huge fan of first person and it really jumps out at me when the time shifts. If a first person narrator knows something she shouldn't or alludes to something she'll know later while the tense is set as present, it throws me right out of the story.) The Royal We is a semi satirical but very sympathetic look at the romance of Will and Kate (with major changes, of course). Being a potential princess is far from easy. Betrayal, partner swaps and unfounded suspicions all add up to Bex and Nick being pure soapy fun in book form.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZTVFHV1CL0U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455557102#wasThisHelpful","R2ZTVFHV1CL0U5","A3FG0FQHNV2UP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FG0FQHNV2UP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know if we all received the same models - for clarity I'll start by saying that my earbuds came with 4 fit sizes and I had no problem getting a good fit. They don't slide around or fall out at all. For comparison purposes, my current favorites are a set of Heartbeats by Beats. These are much better for my needs. The Phiaton MS 100 BA have excellent mid balance. The high and low is acceptable, but I agree that the bass is not dominating. (For comparison purposes again, the bass is superior to the Heartbeats, which I found too strong in the highs, giving them a tinny sound for pop music.) The pouch is cheap and disposable - a faux suede drawstring deal. Instructions are weak but the inline controls were responsive and (once figured out) reliable in use. Sound quality on calls was very good, and I strongly preferred these over the Heartbeats for casual music use (indierock, blues, rap). Very clear and balanced over all. With some tweaking on the low end these would be more impressive but as they stand I really like them. Gave my Beats away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11M8H5YGYQUTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TH0YDY8#wasThisHelpful","R11M8H5YGYQUTE","A3FG0FQHNV2UP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FG0FQHNV2UP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Snyder has been a hit or miss author for me. This time around was the same. I loved coming back to Yelena but it felt off - she seemed less sure of herself, less savvy somehow, than in earlier books. Yelena is still a strong character but rather than a Yelena who has grown wiser we got a Yelena who was softer, less calculating. It's a choice, but it's not where I thought Yelena would evolve. As well, the world building was less intense. I didn't emotionally engage. A major problem for me was the tense changes. I'm not a huge fan of first person. I enjoy books with alternating character perspectives but going from first to third only works for me if the first person is set in a different time period, like a diary.

"I was initially unsure about this line of cases but I've come to really like them. They look and feel like luxury items. On the downside, the upper edge of the phone is exposed as the case only rides up a small bit and does not come over to cover it. There's no scratch protection if you're trying to retain a perfect appearance for later resale. Otherwise, it's great. Good grip, doesn't slide in the hand or on a table, good quality included screen protector. I have a gold phone and the dark brown looked great with it. The interior of the case is smooth and rubberized. Snaps on easily and very securely. It's not going to work for a shock protective Otterbox style need, but the ullu is nicer than the Apple branded leather cases.

"Honestly, I expected to just say ""It's a pencil, what do you expect?""  Cheap pencils have issues with the leads falling out or becoming broken and wobbly. Expensive pencils with colorful exteriors can sharpen very unevenly. Mechanical pencils can snap quickly. As it happens, I was really very impressed with these. On the negative side, I mistrust the long term durability of plastic on a pencil destined for the bottom of a backpack. I wish the eraser was larger or replaceable. (I often use a seperate eraser stick made of what appears to be the same material as this so it's not a huge issue. On the positive side, these were a huge hit in my household. I brought them out at homework time and my kids have a strong positive reaction to the colorful appearance. One, who prefers using mechanical pencils, loved the hardness of the lead and wanted to take them to school. The other, who has never expressed any kind of lead preference, also made a bid for ownership. (The leads do produce a lighter line than a conventional pencil which makes me wonder if they would be accepted for the standardized testing in the schools? We recently moved to computer based testing, so it was less of a concern.) Erasing is smooth and easy, sharpening was even on all sides without lead wobble or imbalanced wood (I ground one all the way down to test it's build). Quality pencil, big hit with a variety of ages. Not the cheapest choice, for sure, but a great option for a fun school supply. Maybe buy an eraser stick, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SRQ0NNAD6I8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHHVX8Y#wasThisHelpful","R3SRQ0NNAD6I8T","A3FG0FQHNV2UP2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FG0FQHNV2UP2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inconsistent character actions bog down what could have been an exceptional read. My teen was bored but my 11 year old loved A Wicked Thing. Interesting twist on the Sleeping Beauty story with a good eye to the consent issues that underline the tale. If cliffhanger endings bother you, give A Wicked Thing a miss - too many issues feel unresolved at the end for the book to fully satisfy.

"My daughters love Nerf products and frequently have friends over for Nerf Wars so I thought they'd all be excited to try the BOOMco product. The girls all rejected it on the grounds that ""those are for boys"". Closer questioning revealed the BOOMco marketing is aimed solely at teen and tween boys, making the girls view the toy negatively. It's a shame, because the gun itself is pretty fun. This is a pump action so not suitable for kids with poor hand strength or smaller kids. The targets have a decent lifespan but I agree with other reviewers - clean your darts or give up on the stickiness.

"In this delightful book, the narrator, Alice Whitley, is on a mission from Mimi Banning's publisher, to see to it that the reclusive author completes her novel. She camps out at Ms. Banning's Bel Air mansion and sees very little of the author, but is fully-occupied with Mimi's 9-year-old son, Frank.Frank is one of the most unforgettable characters you'll find, an irrepressible, wordy, eccentric boy, something of a savant, who favors 1930s clothing (the year of this story is 2010), does not get along with any other kids at school, and takes Alice's full time and attention. The first-person narration, told through Alice's exasperations, makes Frank even more vivid. This is also something of a mystery story, as Alice becomes intrigued with Mimi's family history, and especially: who is Frank's father? It's complicated by the appearance of Xander, a good-looking handyman, piano teacher, and sometime resident of the mansion, since Alice (and we) are left wondering who he is, other than a flaky, charming ne'er-do-well who appears and disappears often. With that, and Mimi's uncertain progress on her novel, and Frank's frequent meltdowns, crises and mishaps, the reader is in for a heady mix of mystery, comic mishaps, unexpected twists and some serious emotional turns. The story is fast-moving, well-told in the first person, and the characters -- Mimi, Alice, the publisher Isaac Vargas, Xander, and especially Frank -- are well-drawn and compelling.Very worthwhile, entertaining, and unforgettable. A splendid first novel from this author. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SHL4WYUFUXDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062413716#wasThisHelpful","R2SHL4WYUFUXDM","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This unit serves two basic functions: it will detect AC current when you point it at wires, sockets or other electrical devices, without the user having to touch the location (as you would, say, with a multimeter), and it will, when plugged into a 3-prong socket, report any anomalies in the circuit. It's a very practical device for anybody working around a household circuit, whether a professional or the homeowner, certainly as a warning that you're near a live circuit. It's something I wish I had during a recent renovation.It ships in plastic clamshell packaging, stiff and hard edged enough to chop vegetables -- that is to say, difficult to cut open. There's a ""quick start guide"" -- a 3x4"" paper -- tucked inside the cardboard liner, so you have to get the packaging fully open to find it. The paper refers you to the Sperry website but you still have to click down to find a PDF user manual. The full URL, to save time:file:///C:/Users/Dell2008/Downloads/vd7504gfi_use_english.pdf (this is off the manufacturer's URL at:)http://www.sperryinstruments.com/en/resources/manualsThe battery -- a shirt-button sized L1154 -- ships separately, inside the clamshell, and you'll need a small Philips screwdriver to open up the device and insert it (the icon on the little door shows which way to insert the battery). The manual (in slightly stilted English) mostly talks about what what the device might not detect in a circuit, but the main thing with this device is that it will alert you that something is amiss. This device seems useful for checking any AC circuit, not just GFCI, The tester will, if inserted in a GFCI socket, pop the socket's breaker (or button) if you push the tester button at that end of the device, so it's a good way to check that particular kind of installation.The device also ships with a plastic sheath for the 3 prongs and you should try and keep it on the unit if you toss it in a tool box -- and be careful about storing it where other tools might press the upper button, the one design matter I believe to be a slight flaw. There's no on-off switch.As for the AC detection at the other end, this tester seems more sensitive than an older Greenlee voltage detector I had, as it can sense live AC at a further distance, up to an inch away in some cases. In all, this device is sensitive, practical, useful for homeowners and professionals, and should be close at hand if you're not sure you turned off the circuit and need to check, one last time, before you touch the wiring yourself. Strongly recommend for anybody's tool box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38D6WWZNNN2HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0152U89DC#wasThisHelpful","R38D6WWZNNN2HR","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a sturdy and well-designed backpack, with two main compartments, with an inner one suitable for a laptop (our 11-1/2x16 Dell fit just fine) with a cloth divider to separate the laptop from other objects (you may have to be careful about lumpy things like power blocks, since the rear section will be up against your back). The outer compartment can hold accessories, including a standard tablet; it's a divided compartment with slots for small objects (including pens/pencils) sewn in the divider. Both compartments have double zippers that look strong, and the fact that they both only unzip halfway down means the bag won't open fully and dump its contents. The outer side mesh pockets are fairly small, but there's a large open pouch outside, in the center.The shoulder straps and back padding are very comfortable, and suitable for either use on a bicycle, say, or simply for hands-off baggage carrying if you're on a trip and juggling other luggage (there is a handle but it's auxiliary and not comfortable for carrying it long distances). The bright green will keep you visible in low-light traffic but has an added advantage: you're not apt to overlook it in one last walk-through in a darkened hotel room. It's soft construction, no rigid framing, so it can press to less than 3"" thick if not in use.In all, it seems comfortable, well-designed as a laptop/tablet carrier, functional and comfortable for day use or as part of a travel ensemble.

"This is a dark journey through a war-ravaged landscape. It's not the usual Civil War tale of battles and the usual soldiers; rather, it makes the western Carolinas and east Georgia look like Germany during the Thirty Years' War, or maybe some dystopian novel of post-devastation America, whose inhabitants are mostly starving civilians, armed robbers, horsemen of no particular loyalty, lost amid a ruined countryside. Callum, a 15-year-old horsethief who had ridden with irregulars (which side? asks a character; ""it doesn't matter much""). He's now on the run, a band of murderous bounty hunters on his scent. He and Ava, a young woman displaced by war, now wander across areas scorched by Sherman's army.The author's attention to period detail and the mundane details, notably horses' limitations and health, is good, and his prose is terse and a steady read. It's a story of war's victims and the wraiths on the fringes, not the ones who made it.- - -""I just realized,"" said Ava.""What?""""The genius of it. All this. Sherman.

"This is a good, compact backup-power battery for two AC power devices, and, coincidentally, a port for charging mobile devices with USB cables. The AC plug-ins in back really do rotate, which is important because many AC cords end in bulky, blocky transformers or such and these rotating sockets help fit them. The unit might not handle large-wattage devices but for what it's designed for -- routers, say -- it's fine, and that means you can keep your AC devices online in a power outage (and recharge mobile devices as well). As a lifeboat in an outage it's a great help, and it's a convenient place to recharge mobile USB-cable devices in normal periods. The unit is a convenient size, about the size and shape of a book, and can fit many cramped areas.The UPS sets up easily, and the little feet can snap in to allow it to stand up or lay sideways, depending on your space needs. The indicator lights are good indicators and very bright green. The device shipped with its own ""quality assurance test"" printout which had test and accuracy data, which was reassuring. I'm using my routers on it and notice no difference in wi-fi or internet quality. In all, a nice addition to a PC station and an enhanced capacity to ride out outages and retain internet connection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQPTYN9GOA1IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JHYQNC#wasThisHelpful","RQPTYN9GOA1IZ","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book originally published in 1981 and had the benefit of first-person sources: the surviving women who had served and who provided many anecdotes, personal accounts amid the ongoing story of the women's bomber and fighter regiments. The stories of the PO-2 regiment -- biplanes engaged in night-intruder raids and enemy-territory drops -- are hair-raising. The other two women's regiments, flying Yak-1 fighters and Pe-2 attack bombers, proved to be brave and capable pilots, with several women scoring impressive totals of German aircraft. All three regiments would fight in the biggest battles of the war -- Crimea, Stalingrad, Kursk, Berlin -- and one, the biplane unit, would be re-numbered as a Guards regiment, the highest unit award, and a number of women in all three regiments won the Hero of the Soviet Union medal, the highest individual honor. Well worthwhile for people interested in military history, Soviet history and women's studies. They served because the Soviet Union had its back to the wall and needed any combatants they could get, but once the women had the chance they proved to be an elite, courageous, resourceful and deadly.Highest recommendation for this unique book.

"This is a tremendous, well-imagined work, its prose readable but elegant, its characters vivid. It‚Äôs a multi-layered story, with interlude chapters for backstory on the main characters, centering on «eda, needed because of the considerable mystery of their identities, including √áeda herself, growing up rough as a ‚Äústreet wren‚Äù and yet finds even she is not what she thought she was. The story is never confusing, never drags even in 600 pages, and immerses the reader.The setting ‚Äì the city of Sharakhai and the surrounding deserts ‚Äì is a fantasy setting that vaguely evokes that of old Arabia or Persia, but only vaguely. This setting is in a place with two moons, in which the gods and the supernatural of Sharakhai seem to have real force, in which women can be elite warriors and pit fighters in the arena. It‚Äôs a place in which trade ships (and pirates) sail on desert sands, and do so plausibly for any reader familiar with sailing. Many of Sharakhai's details -- spices, foods, class distinctions, mannerisms -- are familiar to us in name and texture, just enough for us to identify with this world. In some ways this book evokes Dune more than a typical medieval fantasy ‚Äì the book is that superb.√áeda is a bold but complex, and compelling character, and the strong relationship she has with her mother, an equally-strong protagonist, is central to this story. She‚Äôs a character worth following through these many pages and into the sequels to come.Strongest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24XS8PLV0W03L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756409721#wasThisHelpful","R24XS8PLV0W03L","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Setup was easy, though multi-step. The printer was quick to make wireless connection to my system, using the WPS option. Software setup to a computer on the network went OK, and the first prints ‚Äì Epson test paper prints on 8x11 paper ‚Äì came out fine. I also printed a 4x6 color glossy from my own photographs and it was surprisingly good quality.Epson setup includes an option to monitor your use of the scanner so they can offer you specials. Privacy-minded users may want to decline this part.As for scanning, you can insert a memory card from a digital camera, in most common formats (SD, SDHC, SDXC and their mini versions), into the printer, or use the USB ports (e.g., a thumb drive) or send it wireless, since the image file has to export somewhere. File limitations: scanner output is JPEG (or, from the Epson Scan software, PDF or WSD web) format and only up to 2MB, which is OK for documents, and our scans were indeed OK. The Epson Scan software allows you to operate the scanner from there, which is helpful, and it appears to be similar to their software for other Epson scanners, including default file storage and file-name assignments (default is img001, 002 etc. though you can specify otherwise).The unit does provide for some file manipulation (cropping, etc.) before printing, and you can swap photos in/out of the card. You can also print directly from a camera that uses PictBridge (many Canon DSLR cameras, for instance, seem to use PictBridge), or from mobile devices like cell phones or tablets.Downsides: paper can accommodate a number of different sizes up to legal but very limited quantities, The shallow trays (two) are an obvious design compromise to keep it small, though it helps that the unit can do two-sided printing. Users have to close the output tray any time they need to reload either of the two paper trays below it, and tray 1 (photo stock) tends to slide in too far past its (very light) detent point and needs to be fished back sometimes. The lid to the scanner hinge doesn‚Äôt seem disjoint or detach as some scanners will; you can get documents or something as thick as a magazine under the lid but that seems to be it, not, say, an open book.Scanner resolution is only 1200x2400. (By comparison, my older Epson V600 scanner has 6400x9600). This is still fine for document scanning (B&W or grayscale) but may pose some limitations in terms of picture scanning, as opposed to direct uploads from mobile devices or cameras. Plastic paper and output trays seem rather fragile and users should take care that they‚Äôre fully closed and the display folded down when the unit is not in use or is being moved.In all, it is indeed a small-in-one unit, reasonably compact and wireless, and reasonable quality given its limitations. Its main virtue is that it can serve as scanner, printer and photo printer in various sizes of media, doesn‚Äôt take up as much desk space as the three separate units and may even be reasonably portable, or it can serve as a standalone for any mobile devices or cameras happening by, if you simply want to scan or download and then print.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UGKMZZM8X4FD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU62T2#wasThisHelpful","R1UGKMZZM8X4FD","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A good solid surge protector, and a thoughtful design. Six AC sockets, oriented sideways, which can be helpful, with the last two of them spaced to accommodate transformer plugs (which is to say, something with a bulky end on the cord). I have this unit in a hobby/tool shop room, and the dust covers on the AC sockets is a nice touch in a room with dust and sawdust. The metal housing seems solid. The 1000 joules' protection is good (my ordinary hardware-store surge protector had 245), esp. if you're working with electronic equipment. The rear cover has four slotted openings that you can use to hang the unit on a wall; the openings are kind of tiny but they can still take small woodscrew heads or small hooks, and they're in a =o= shape so that you can slide the head up or down inside the opening for a solid hang. In all, a good surge protector for shop (or even home) settings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18HU6I0L60MHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMN6U#wasThisHelpful","R18HU6I0L60MHZ","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Plus side: the 800 joules' protection is a strong point (my hardware-store power-strip/surge protector only had 245). The rear cover has four brackets that can accommodate wall hooks or push pins. As a simple surge protector, it's okay.Downsides: the wall outlet is a straight-out plug (right-angle plugs can be more convenient, esp. on baseboard sockets). The ""rotating"" sockets on the unit seem to be surface only (basically, dust covers), as plugged-in components won't rotate, or at least not without more force than I'd want to attempt. There's only four outlets, and closely-spaced and in a head-to-foot alignment, so anything with a transformer (AC to DC) block on the end will need an extension. The two USB plugs are 2.1A shared, so effectively it's one USB, and it's on the same side as the AC sockets, which is probably there's four ACs, not six. Also, if this surge protector is on the floor, as it's apt to be underneath, say, a PC or desk, it's going to collect dust.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ULYF25SSW9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFKUHBS#wasThisHelpful","R2ULYF25SSW9K","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a handy little device whose main virtue is portability, roughly hand-sized, with a flip-out 3-prong plug (no cord, a good thing), with two AC sockets and one USB socket, and also a row of four LEDs that seem to show battery level. This gadget is a convenient size to pack with mobile devices or laptops, to take on trips and use for AC-powered devices or USB charging. I've tried the battery (unplugged) and the USB outlet will charge a cell phone on its own if the power is out, and the surge protection is handy if you're traveling and the power is uncertain or you've got electrical storms nearby. That's all it does: one AC plugin, two ACs out, a USB port for charging, and an internal battery to charge small mobile devices, if needed (no accessory parts). It does seem to recharge quickly enough, but may continue to take power if left plugged in.The packaging seems user-friendly and recycleable. The main instructions are on the inner cover (it warns you not to use hair blowers or steam irons, since its capacity is 1000w and meant for mobile or small electronic devices -- of course), and seems to indicate that the USB is best for charging mobile phones or tablets. The package also includes two leaflets, in tiny print, one a ""declaration"" of conformity with FCC rules on electromagnetic compatibility, and the other an instruction/warranty leaflet. The latter has a warranty you need to examine carefully, since it comes with a lot of ""buts"" and a complicated claim process. The instruction part of the leaflet talks about Belkin products that have mounts, phone and coaxial connections (RJ11/RJ45) that have to do with other Belkin products, not this one.In all, a simple, easy-to-pack, and handy companion for your mobile devices and laptop, especially on the road.

"This is a nonfiction book about generations of families living on either side of what had been the 1949-1967 ceasefire line in Jerusalem, and then re-named Assael Street (or Asa'el, the very spellings are in dispute). It's a place with a view of the Temple Mount, and its neighborhood -- Abu Tor -- is also on the Hill of Evil Counsel, where Judas supposedly met with Caiaphas, and where Moshe Dayan and his Jordanian counterpart, in 1949, would draw a ceasefire line, divide a neighborhood on a map with two grease pencils, and leave a permanent border, sometimes visibly barricaded, sometimes not so visibly.The book reads, oddly enough, like a James Michener saga with its focus on the families there, their lives and travails, but it is sensitively written, and about real people on the knife-edge: a small dead-end street on the border between East and West Jerusalem. The author is at his best at telling the stories of several families, Jewish and Palestinian, over the years as their goats and chickens stray into no man's land, as Israeli and Jordanian soldiers snipe at the people (some times fatally) and UN officers negotiate border alignment and, in one case, look for dentures dropped in the zone.We learn about the brief conciliation and tentative friendships of these neighbors after the 1967 war and the replacement of barbed wire with a common street, and the gradual hardening of suspicions as outside events affect these people. The author's a bit conclusory in his review of outside events but he does show how these people are affected personally, as security checkpoints tighten, as the Israeli occupation questions house and property ownership, as they encounter hassles over ID and building permits, as an oversized new building goes up smack in the middle of the neighborhood. A new wall is coming, proposed as a division between East and West Jerusalem, to this very place, again.The narrative does leap back and forth in time, although the author's focus on a few families helps keep it coherent. He has a sympathetic way of writing about these people, Palestinian and Israeli, that does shade toward the former, although it's more a matter of telling about personal misfortune rather than getting into polemics. Vae victis.The book is worthwhile as sociology, a story of how events and a very unique geography affects a small neighborhood. It's not so much a ""microcosm"" of the larger conflict as it is a camera, a street view during some stormy decades. Strongly recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCBOY7RDGOTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072948#wasThisHelpful","R1SCBOY7RDGOTI","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lively and unusual kind of detective story. Constance Kopp is someone who is determined, assertive and adventurous, and who won't accept the limits her times -- 1914, New Jersey -- place on her as a single woman. It's a dangerous time: her nemesis is a silk-factory boss in a Paterson, NJ, that is in the midst of labor strife and pro-labor courts and police. She's a spunky, likable character, speaking in the first person here, and her character is believable and interesting, as are her unmarried sisters. There's a backstory woven in this, as well as the main plot, a dangerous conflict between her and the boss and his thuggish confederates -- it's rooted in a real-life story and seems true to the period and the characters. And it is something of a mystery: maybe we know who the bad guys are, and maybe there's more, much more to it.Strongly recommend -- and here's hoping that this character has sequels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24OIOAWK9B8ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544409914#wasThisHelpful","R24OIOAWK9B8ZT","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book's merit, the author's talent, is in its layered narratives, something that raises it up from a war story to something more literary. It interweaves the wartime memoirs of Poxl West, a young Czech Jewish refugee who escapes occupied Europe to serve in a rescue squad in London during the Blitz, and then as an RAF pilot, with the coming of age, 40 years later, of his adoring teenaged American nephew Elijah, at a time when the memoirs publish and Poxl becomes famous. The stories are well-told, the characters believable, and the book takes on more interest as the stories become darker, more complicated, more unexpected.

"This remarkable, moving book evokes a time and places ‚Äì Italy and Argentina in 1913 and later ‚Äì in which women were confined in narrow roles, roles enforced violently at times. Yet Leda, using her wits and musical talent, disguises herself as Dante and proceeds to cross all boundaries of poverty, nationality, gender, class, sexual orientation, romance. The later-day ‚Äúin the closet‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even begin to explain the times and the dangers. Discovery could be fatal, literally, so her rise through the new tango scene is terrifying as she continues her disguise in the most public way, on stage as part of a rising music group in a field closed to women. The story ‚Äì and her back-story, flashbacks to her home village in Italy ‚Äì makes the reader want Dante so somehow win in the end, or at least somehow survive the dangers in every step, every dance.‚ÄúThis new life brought many freedoms. She could smoke, she could walk the streets at night, she could curse and spit into gutters. She could hold down a job that paid twice as much as anything a woman could do with her clothes on. But there were also new demands. She had to be extremely careful with her posture (head up, shoulders squared) and her gait (long sure strides, no swaying hips). She had to exude confidence, if not outright bravado, at all times ...‚ÄùThe prose can be hypnotic, lyrical, flowing, an evocation of the time and place and a new craze: ‚Äú...that was when they truly merged, the song robust, men dancing again, with each other or with whores and by the third song the guitarist had emerged from the back room and joined back in and it was magic to blend sound with them like this, with strangers, and the sound they made was red red red and stripped of all the lies they told all day and night to survive these Americas, a naked sound that pulsed with everything they longed to be and never would become except like this, alone in a crowd, playing tango. They played for two more hours, during which the wounded violinist bled to death in the back room ...‚ÄùAn astonishing, enthralling, gripping story of a time and a main character whom the reader will understand, follow, dance with.

"The unit comes with a power cord, CD with a setup wizard and users‚Äô guide, and a short LAN CAT-6 cable. (Users‚Äô guide also available as a PDF file at the trendnet.com website.) All very well, so far.The unit itself is about the size of a deck of playing cards and has a WPS button and a 10/100 LAN port. (10/100 Mbps LAN speed isn't a good sign if you want fast wireless speeds through an existing LAN system.) The unit ships with a printed tag showing the preset wireless settings (wi-fi name, wi-fi key, management log-in); this, unfortunately, is part of the plastic cling wrap and peels off the unit, so you should probably keep it with the CD or someplace else that‚Äôs safe.The CD itself will bring up a setup menu on your screen, with buttons. Unfortunately, clicking on the ""Setup"" button got this:‚ÄúError executing file.E:/SetupWizard/Setup.exeThe requested operation requires elevation.‚ÄùElevation? (I thought this was bad English but judging by other reviews, you really do need to put this thing up high). Anyway, using a file manager (Windows Explorer) I could go to that file on the CD and double-click the setup.exe file, and go through the routine. I did try this setup on two different older computers -- Vista and Windows 7, natural enough if you want to use this unit to upgrade an older home network, and I wanted to use this unit as a new wi-fi spot on the far side of the house, which has CAT-6 wiring in the walls and a TP-LINK wi-fi router already at a central location. I could get the TEW unit to join the LAN system and make a wireless connection to a laptop; the signal was stronger on that side of the house, as I had hoped. I could not get the WPS buttons to work, however, but could connect the laptop manually, entering the wi-fi key. Trouble was, the TEW also kept cutting out for reasons I'm still trying to discern -- one moment it's there, one moment it's gone.I'll keep working with this unit, but so far it's problematic. The dead link in the Setup wasn't a terribly good sign, either, suggesting that perhaps this product could have used more debugging or testing before it went on the market. (Yes, this is a free product under the Vine program, but it is costing in terms of time, frustration and effort trying to make it succeed). I'll add supplemental comments if I can make this thing work any better.ADDENDUM, Aug. 6, 2015: Spent three more hours today trying to make this product work, and, yes, I ""elevated"" it, and tested the wi-fi with the wi-fi laptop six inches away. Still no luck -- and the Setup display still locked up on two different laptops as before, in fact it wouldn't go away and I had to re-boot both, with a hard Windows restart (black screen, stark type) on both. I'm left wondering what's on the startup CD. I've had PCs for over 30 years and this was not ""easy"" even for me. Two stars. No hits, no runs, one error.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GIA6A7L1LQ3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPDPFMI#wasThisHelpful","R3GIA6A7L1LQ3I","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's everything you need both to self-teach yourself how to use WordPress, but also, if you have your own website in mind, even if it's a clutter of words and images, you can use this book to construct your website as you self-teach. WordPress itself is open-source software -- that is, WordPress.com will provide a means of hosting your site with their software (continuously updated) or, instead, you can go to WordPress.org and download the that software (version 4.1, in this book). Either way, much of the hosting and software is free, easy to use, and well-known. WordPress is a platform where you can download and use plugins, themes, widgets -- and the book tells you what/how/whether to use them -- and more, often free as well. You'll learn both formats, though much of the book is directed to the simpler WordPress.com. If you're new to all this, you'll have no problem thanks to this book.The format is brightly visual, color-coded by chapter, and walks you through, step by step, in creating a website and selecting the components.

"The chair comes in a large crate, but still needs assembly. The crate came with four major sub-packages with chair back, arms/pedestal/wheels, swivel base, chair seat, instructions and tools (two wrenches, one hex key, extra bolts/nuts) included. Packaging was somewhat crude, with sub-assemblies wrapped in cardboard and cellophane tape. Chair assembly took me about 40 minutes.I had some problems with the chair back assembly. The instructions weren't clear as to the back-adjustment piston positioning ‚Äì is the lever arm up or down, for example? Also, I found the back (tilt) adjustment stiff and unworkable, but found out ‚Äì by trial and error ‚Äì that careful rotation of the piston cylinder can stiffen or loosen the piston. (This was not in the instructions). Also, given the forces on the chair back hinge ‚Äì the two bolts where the seat and back join, and where the back pivots in adjustment ‚Äì users may want to put a washer on each bolt to save wear and tear. The chair probably needs more washers in any pivot points involving rotation and variable stress‚Äì chair back, back piston attachment points ‚Äì or some other fasteners.Once assembled, the chair seems comfortable, very much so, and the lumbar back support is a fine idea. The chair will adjust vertically and in back if the pneumatic cylinders are working; the arm rests and headrest also adjust vertically. In looks and ergonomics, it‚Äôs a fine chair. The straps mean that it would be cooler on a warm day.Once assembled, it's a good, comfortable chair. The looks are striking -- a little severe, or at least modernist, but if you're looking for comfort and functionality it's just fine. The manufacturer should re-think the packaging, and maybe ship it mostly- or fully-assembled ‚Äì the chair, with the base, arm rests and headrest detached, would have fit in the crate.

"Assembly is fairly simple, mainly clicking the arm assembly into the base, and connecting the power cord. The power block is a little bulky, may crowd other plug ins if it‚Äôs on a power strip, but you probably should have it on a power strip as it uses some energy (the red power button stays lit whether the lamp is on or off).The unit is good-looking, somewhat elegant in a tech-y way, and if folded in the vertical (closed) position, has a relatively small footprint on a desk or table. The light, in my experience, is warm when lit but not unduly so, and provides a good pattern of light but need not glare if positioned and set to the right light level (user has a choice of five). The upper arm, containing the light, feels metallic but seems to dissipate any heat, and gives the unit physical stability and solidity, esp. when folded, so it seems to be reasonably durable.Flexible positioning: Lower arm tilts 30 degrees forward from the vertical and 90 degrees back, and will rotate horizontally almost 180 degrees to either side. The upper arm can rest folded down against the lower to be compact when not in use, and can raise up 180 to full vertical; it also rotates laterally about 150 degrees to either side from its usual flat-downward angle. It can position within any of those four arcs and hold the position (although it gets a little tippy if it faces in some direction away from its base). This allows the user considerable flexibility in positioning the light, and the five light settings mean that the light need only be as bright as needed.In all, it‚Äôs a practical, good-looking, and economical light for desks, work tables or any work surface.

"It's a compelling story: how an American physician, Sumner Jackson, somehow stayed on in Nazi-occupied Paris, at his job at the American hospital, while he and his wife Toquette aided the Resistance and assisted downed Allied fliers -- and all this while living at No. 11, Avenue Foch, with their young son, on a block with Gestapo offices at No. 58, 72 and 84. It would be implausible as a spy thriller, but this story is real, and this author was able to interview key participants in this story. The story is certainly gripping, the author was able to convey the first-person feel of wartime Paris, and his characters -- Gestapo, Resistance, SS, the Jacksons themselves -- are vivid. That this family, enemy aliens after 1941, could continue their activity, with this level of exposure, with a child at risk as well, is breathtaking. That the author was able to interview the living means that this is perhaps the most personal account of this remarkable family.

"Please note that this is the black T4U adapter, not the white (rabbit-eared) T4UH adapter, and it's for devices (PCs, etc.) needing to connect to an existing wi-fi system/router. The Quick Installation Guide was clear, and the CD provided the wireless link utility and a (PDF) operations manual to answer any further questions.

Download/transfer speed was about 2 - 2.5x faster with the T4U than with the existing built-in wi-fi (20-25 MB/sec v. 9-10 MP/s respectively, or a difference of 45 sec. instead of 2 minutes). It was also faster than tests with a T4UH, interestingly, which was about 15-20 MB/s). You probably should have, or install, a USB 3 port on your computer for this adapter if you don't have one already.The unit is quite small, maybe two fingers' size, which makes it good for mobile setups as opposed, say, to a stationary desk PC. The cap detaches, which makes it easy to lose; the unit is fat enough, if plugged in directly, to crowd adjoining USB ports but the included USB extension cord eliminates that problem.

"This seems to be an executive summary; as we learn, Wikileaks‚Äô ‚ÄúPublic Library of US Diplomacy,‚Äù or PlusD, is now a searchable archive of over 2.3 million documents, and not just the recent ‚ÄúCablegate‚Äù leak but the Kissinger and Carter cables as well, going back to 1966. Chapter 4, ‚ÄúIndexing the Empire,‚Äù alone is worth a four-star rating, since it describes the collection and provides journalists and researchers useful tips on how to search PlusD, and more important, find similar cables to put a document in context. It also provides a guide to indexing and terminology.As to what the cables say, the book provides commentary. Julian Assange‚Äôs ‚Äúintroduction‚Äù is over 140 pp.: Part One of the book, its first three chapters. The remaining chapters are each by a different author, each about a different part of the world, Europe, Russia, Iran, Iraq and so forth, as seen through these cables and through the U.S. State Department. The overall picture is: this is how the U.S. does business, and has over several recent decades.The book‚Äôs title is slightly misleading: as Assange mentions, and other chapters also make clear, is that the U.S. global reach isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúempire‚Äù in the traditional sense, governing conquered provinces. Rather, it seems to be a hegemon in which compliant local governments, usually authoritarian or military regimes, often corrupt, govern on behalf of U.S. national strategic interests, and on behalf of U.S. multinational corporations ‚Äì backed by U.S. military power, although that is usually indirect. The authors are judgmental ‚Äì this is indeed commentary as well as a summary ‚Äì but each essay is a view of what the cables mean, in a particular country or landmass.The chapter titles are somewhat misleading as well: Assange‚Äôs Chapter 2, ‚ÄúDictators and Human Rights,‚Äù is about U.S. handling of human rights in foreign lands, and Chapter 3, ‚ÄúWar and Terrorism,‚Äù is more about corporations, global markets and environmental impacts. Some of the observations are profound, e.g., ‚ÄúThe United States had visited an apocalypse on Vietnam to avert the danger of ‚Äòcommunism,‚Äô and failed. But where it failed, debt, finance and the institutions of global capitalism succeeded.‚Äù And not just there, as he explains.Same is true for the other commenters‚Äô chapters: Chapter 5, ‚ÄúUS War Crimes and the ICC‚Äù is mainly about the U.S. coercing countries over participation in the International Criminal Court system, which might prosecute U.S. war crimes but still would need participating nation-states. Still, the commentaries, chapter by chapter and country by country, do show how these enforcement patterns work, with the State Department as the field offices. The commentaries are often dense reads but stay on topic. The book provides no new earthshaking, standalone revelations but does suggest a disturbing pattern. It‚Äôs also a door to an archive from which other researchers, journalists, historians might take different, or new, findings.It‚Äôs an old story: in the 1933 book and speech ‚ÄúWar is a Racket,‚Äù Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler said, ‚Äú...when the dollar only earns 6 percent over here, then it gets restless and goes overseas to get 100 percent. Then the flag follows the dollar and the soldiers follow the flag.‚Äù This book shows that it‚Äôs truer now than ever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJ3SRX1EMZQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781688745#wasThisHelpful","R1JJ3SRX1EMZQE","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an important look at an organization with considerable political and economic power in the United States: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It‚Äôs a relatively recent force, we learn, organized in 1914 at the urging of President William Howard Taft, and only in the 1990s would it take its current shape as a national advocate for the largest corporate interests. It not always operates in the best interests of most businesses ‚Äì this book shows that most local chambers of commerce are not US Chamber members, and increasingly it advocates for a narrow range of business interests, notably those in international sectors such as retail, tobacco, fossil fuels or finance. Those businesses interested in renewable energy, concerned about global warming or employees‚Äô health premiums often aren‚Äôt as well-served. Indeed, as late as 1993 the Chamber had, in the debate on the Clinton health plan, originally focused concern on how much businesses were paying in health-insurance premiums.However, and this seems to have been a turning point, conservative political interests then engineered a change in U.S. Chamber leadership, and the Chamber would oppose the Clinton proposal. We see some insights into the Hillarycare failure and, in this incident, the rise of John Boehner. And it was from this point on, we see, that the U.S. Chamber would become key to Republican interests.We see that the Chamber‚Äôs activities not limited to Congressional campaign fundraising; the author shows how diverse its activities: lobbying, and drafting legislation, in Congress, as well as backing (and recruiting) pro-Chamber state legislators. It cherry-picks state judges and attorneys-general. It pioneered ‚ÄúAstroturf‚Äù campaigns in lobbying, and continues to. It litigates in Federal court ‚Äì which has been, under their persuasion, more and more favorable to their interests. It has been key to blocking regulation in finance before and after the 2008 mortgage crash, and in matters of highway and product safety. It used Federal grant regulation to intimidate or stifle scientific research in areas like climate, product safety, or the environment. Even without the Chamber‚Äôs cooperation, Ms. Katz‚Äô research seems thorough and damning.And its influence isn‚Äôt limited to the U.S. proper: we learn about ‚ÄúAmChams‚Äù, the American Chambers of Commerce in China and elsewhere, which wield considerable influence on other countries‚Äô labor practices and laws, even in China ‚Äì notably in a recent shift toward temp workforces. These, of course, represent more profit for the Chamber‚Äôs corporate clients overseas, less opportunity for the workers there and exported jobs from U.S. workers.In all, this book provides timely, new and important insights into a major force in U.S. politics and the economy, and how it got that way, relatively recently in our history. Highly recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWUBAJDP8IXS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993284#wasThisHelpful","RWUBAJDP8IXS5","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fast-paced and ironic story of intrigue in post-WWII Tangier, during the period when Tangier was still an international (and lawless) zone. It's a setting well-known, in real life and in many novels, for the expatriate society of that day, awash in booze, drugs, smuggling and boys, but this author manages a fresh and lively visit for this story. Simply told, Francis Bacon, British artist, follows his war-hero lover David to Tangier and finds no end of peril: David's wartime PTSD makes him an unpredictable danger; Francis falls in with art forgers who compel him to paint fake Picassos and face danger from them and the law; Francis finds them linked to the underworld and to Soviet and British intelligence; Francis gets mixed up in a murder. What makes it interesting is that Francis stumbles from one scrape to another, pursued by criminals, smugglers and spies far above his abilities, and still is indiscreet enough to spend an afternoon picking up beach boys or pursuing David when he should have been on the last boat to Gibraltar.The pace is fast, the setting colorful (visually and culturally), the sex not a distraction or explicit, and Francis' predicaments come one after another, enough to make this a fast, interesting and sometimes amusing read. It's sort of noir, spy thriller, and a dash of Marx Brothers. It's the third in a trilogy, but this book stands on its own -- and makes the reader curious about the other Francis Bacon novels. There's a possible, if racy, British miniseries in this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35B2AMGS2WR2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497641497#wasThisHelpful","R35B2AMGS2WR2G","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An engaging historical novel about the pioneering aviatrix and adventurer Beryl Markham, told in the first person. It follows the story she told in her autobiography, West with the Night, and with the same events: her birth in England at the start of the 20th Century, her wild-childhood on her father‚Äôs farm in British East Africa, her adventures with her dog and her almost being eaten by a half-tamed lion, her success as the first woman horse-trainer in the British-Kenya racing circuit, and her becoming the first woman bush pilot in Kenya. This author, Paula McClain, has filled out her narrative with her romances, two unhappy marriages and her friendship with Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen, Out of Africa) and the rakish Denys Finch Hatton, loved by both women.If you haven‚Äôt read West with the Night, this novel is still worth reading. This remarkable woman was an adventurer from her girlhood, and her life certainly makes for vivid reading. The author fills us in on life among the privileged British colonial aristocracy, which we‚Äôre told was booze-, drug- and sex-addled. Nobility like the future Edward VIII and his brother Henry put in cameos, and there‚Äôs plenty of titillating romantic adventures for this Beryl Markham. And there‚Äôs plenty of drama in the stables and racetrack as well. But do read West with the Night when you finish this book.If you have read West with the Night, you‚Äôll have to accept this book as historical fiction, in narrator's style as well as story, since the nonfiction Beryl Markham wrote in a straightforward Hemingwayish prose. That Beryl Markham was thoughtful, eloquent and reflective, while this book‚Äôs narrator writes in the manner of a romance novel. There‚Äôs plenty of romantic intrigue, some of it sordid, that you won‚Äôt find in the autobiography, while there‚Äôs much less of her career as a pilot (she was, among other things, the first woman to solo across the Atlantic, east to west).Nonetheless, Beryl Markham was a remarkable person, this novel does convey a place and time in colonial Kenya, and if this novel, combined with her autobiography, makes her life as well-known as the Out of Africa book and movie, then this novel will have served her memory well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P5RDN1CTVY68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345534182#wasThisHelpful","R1P5RDN1CTVY68","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A well-crafted series of short stories, set in present-day Belgium, usually in the Ardennes region or nearby.

"I came to this book expecting to be favorably inclined. I‚Äôm in a 30+ year same-sex relationship, was married in my church six years ago (UCC, not the author‚Äôs Presbyterian denomination, but even so), known a number of seminarians and ministers, am a weekly churchgoer familiar with the biblical issues involved. But.Michael Regele goes over two issues: scientific and religious. It‚Äôs a bit odd that someone religious by training would spend about half the book on science, but he does marshal a lot of scientific studies in Chapters 3, 4 and 9, to assert that LGBT orientation is innate, rather than a choice. To give him credit, he does review the data from the other side (notably the Family Research Council, itself a religious organization) and contest it: useful enough for religious people who may have heard some of this debate, so it was a worthwhile effort, as far as it goes.Even so, if he was going to dip into sociology it would have been nice if he had talked to LGBT people, or at least LGBT seminarians, instead of treating this as an abstract issue. He does mention his daughter‚Äôs announcement that she is a lesbian, and he mentions gay people he knew early in his ministry, in the 1970s and 1980s, a vastly different time in society in general, the gay community in particular. But that‚Äôs all. It‚Äôs a rather dry, wordy analysis.LGBT readers, laypeople at least, might find this slightly offensive, the idea that they are some kind of abstract phenomenon, an issue, not individuals. Worse yet, if Regele‚Äôs aim is to show that same-sex attraction is forgivable because it‚Äôs innate, it suggests that those people can‚Äôt help themselves. (It shouldn‚Äôt go without saying, and yet it does, that Christian faith is a choice, marriage is a choice, and both are also identify-defining characteristics ‚Äì and expect freedom from discrimination too; equal protection under the law isn‚Äôt limited to heredity).And on the subject of real LGBT people, Regele apparently didn‚Äôt touch on the history. He does devote a chapter or so to the changing cultural tide, as he calls it, with a lot of polling data. Even here, though, it comes off as a natural progression, a tidal phenomenon or tectonic movement, when, in fact, activists struggled for years in society and in medical and religious conferences to get it to this point. He could have skimmed historians of the movement like George Chauncey, Randy Shilts, Jonathan Katz among others to get a sense of the struggle and the human drama of it.As for his religious arguments, he reviews the Biblical passages on homosexuality: Gen. 19 (Sodom & Gomorrah), Lev. 18 and 20, Romans 1, 1 Cor. 6, 1 Tim. 1 and Jude. He applies considerable technical analysis ‚Äì exegesis ‚Äì to them and examines the original Hebrew and Greek wording. He even finds the Biblical cross-references to Sodom elsewhere, in Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, where the Scriptures there suggest that Sodom may have been a matter of inhospitality to foreigners, or hostility to the poor ‚Äì both themes that may be relevant to current American society. All this is ground that John O‚ÄôNeill and John Boswell first researched decades ago, but it‚Äôs still a worthwhile, detailed and competent review, and he does construct a theology of inclusion.(We could have used a discussion of some other Bible verses, more upbeat ones, about David and Jonathan. And Ruth and Naomi).I sense that this is the kind of book, and argument, current maybe 10, 15 years ago. As I write (March 2015), the U.S. Supreme Court is cooking up a ruling that may extend same-sex marriage from the current three dozen or so to all 50 states. Now, maybe not all Christian churches may want to perform weddings, and maybe they shouldn‚Äôt, but those that do may be pondering what to do next, whether this new source of celebrations might bring new congregants and goodwill to denominations that are otherwise losing membership and funds to age, disinterest and hard times. (Among other things, Regele didn‚Äôt cite Boswell‚Äôs Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe, which not only suggests early Christian approaches but could be a rich source of liturgy for future weddings.)And while he was at it, he might have reflected on what this means for his daughter. He wouldn‚Äôt have to interview her, but he needed only reflect on what it means for her, especially now. He might also have reflected on the civics: why the religious-minded would want to use politics and the law to deny her the ability to form a legal household, own a home together, raise a legal family together -- and deny her church the chance to solemnize it. Another worthy chapter left unwritten.I see this book as helpful for ministers and seminarians who may be new to this discussion, or are seeking talking points. Lay LGBT people may find it off-putting and dry. Certainly those whose minds are made up won‚Äôt accept this, though some doubters might find it of interest. A religious publisher like Abingdon must have thought this useful for religious professionals already in the discussion ‚Äì but this book‚Äôs timeliness and appeal to laypeople needs work. Maybe a future revised edition might correct it.(Postscript: the author's PCUSA general assembly voted March 2015 to allow its clergy to officiate over same-sex marriages in states where it is legal. It seems to be an optional choice -- pastors may do weddings, but aren't compelled to -- so this vote begins an internal debate, not end it. The 2015 Supreme Court decision means that PCUSA may have more pressure to do weddings, but this book's stilted, dated analysis may not be entirely helpful. Three stars, though some of the Bible analysis may be on point in PCUSA right now.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6OAOFBTF3ZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426798296#wasThisHelpful","R2R6OAOFBTF3ZX","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sarah Helm has done an enormous feat of research and investigation: the story of Ravensbruck, the one camp in the Nazi system for women victims, could well have been obscured or lost. The Nazis, as she shows, tried to eliminate documentation and witnesses; the site was behind the Iron Curtain for decades and mostly leveled for a Soviet army base; even after the Soviet period, she tells us, the locals wanted to replace the site with a supermarket. The site has a memorial now, but Ms. Helm went to extraordinary lengths to find and interview the survivors, as well as go through archives, surviving documents and trial records. Many of the survivors had been kept in silence till now; the Soviet, East German and British governments had varying reasons to keep the story quiet. Now, in horrifying detail, here it is.The author did well to find the aging survivors and piece their stories together, some of it in more detail than the war-crimes testimonies, some of it new. Some is fragmentary: she relates an account of a children's party at Christmas 1944, as appalling as it sounds, but is unable to confirm a story of a bombing of that barracks that night. We're left to wonder if it was nightmare or some terrible crime; she obviously went to great effort to get at any detail, in this story as in all the rest.The author shows us every facet of this camp, from its opening in May 1939 till its fall in April 1945. It would grow large, with thousands of prisoners and thousands of deaths, and every evil of the Holocaust would visit: slave labor for German war industry, hideous medical experiments involving gangrene, forced sterilization, starvation, and mass murders by shooting, mistreatment and a gas chamber. We learn that the prisoners included large numbers of children, and babies born in the camp (almost none of the latter 600 would survive). We learn of the SS custodial and medical staff, and of camp society: its informers, collaborators, resisters, prisoners consigned to the ""slum"" section of camp.It was a major camp: from an original body of German women prisoners the camp would take in every nationality and group set out for maltreatment, notably French women, Jews, Soviet women prisoners, gypsies (Roma). We learn that the camp was a personal project of Heinrich Himmler, from its inception on, and he paid considerable attention to its workings. We learn that the story doesn't end well: Swedish bus evacuations in 1945 arranged by Count Bernadotte but often strafed by Allied aircraft; the camp itself overrun by Soviet forces and the surviving inmates raped. It's all set out in readable (if horrific) detail -- this may very well be the definitive story of this place.Indispensable as a memorial of this part of the Holocaust; an important and careful work of scholarship; a detailed indictment of just how villainous human government can be. This needed telling.(Note, Feb. 2015: This book may be listed as ""If This Is a Woman: Inside Ravensbruck - Hitler's Concentration Camp for Women,"" by Sarah Helm.

"It's a fast-paced mystery/thriller: rising tensions between Pakistan and India set the stage in this novel for a possible nuclear crisis. The protagonist, now working for a Washington Beltway consultancy, finds signs of a terrorist plot out of Pakistan -- but then becomes aware of a shadow movement in Washington that may somehow be tied to it.

The very people he trusted, needless to say, turn out to be far different and complex than he bargained for, as events move toward a scary completion.As a page-turner, it's readable and entertaining, and readers will find this a compelling new addition to this genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BXY94FQBTDGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399165711#wasThisHelpful","R1BXY94FQBTDGH","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an important work of reporting, on an important moment in war-crimes law: the torture and war-crimes charges resulting from the recent conflict in Liberia. The book sketches the history of that unhappy place, and its unique ties to the US, from the 19th Century on. Thus it brings the reader to the 1990s presidency of Charles Taylor, Sr., who would become the first African head of state tried for crimes against humanity; he came to power in a time of violent revolution and would wage ongoing war in Liberia and two neighboring countries. Thus we come to the main character, Charles ""Chucky"" Taylor, Jr., a young American citizen who would rejoin his father -- and his father's government -- after a troubled American upbringing.The narrative from then on is Chucky's participation, and orchestration, of some of the vilest torture, murder and warfare in a Liberia already steeped in years of civil war. The stories -- often particular individuals instead of numberless victims -- is the sort of detail, cruel detail, that would come up in trial, and the stories are first shocking, then numbing in their endlessness. It helps to know how he could pass from a somewhat-sordid American background to leading a murder squad, and then escape Liberia after his father's downfall thinking the US might serve as a haven.Chucky is important in that as an American citizen, he would end up on trial in a US Federal court -- and he would be the first (and so far only) US citizen tried and convicted on the Federal statute on torture, section 2340 of Title 18, US Code. Against the background of official ""enhanced interrogation"" elsewhere -- and the author does draw parallels in summing up -- this is a useful source for those interested in this case's legal implications. It's also a concise if dreadful human story. For those unfamiliar with Liberia's unique history, this book is a useful primer -- others have called Chucky's story a ""heart of darkness"" progress and it's an apt comparison.Strong recommendation for those interested in current African history, current US policy, international humanitarian law or US legal history. It reads like crime reporting somewhat but it's still of value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29IDOLHEPT64B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307273482#wasThisHelpful","R29IDOLHEPT64B","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For those who enjoy historical fiction, this book is ideal. It has a first-person narrator, Marti Zuviria, who is by turns sardonic, vivid, roguish, but never dull. It has a vast canvas, a European war (officially, the War of the Spanish Succession, 1700-1714) through which he careens, on both sides as well as his own. It has a cast of historic, colorful figures like the legendary Marquis de Vauban, who educates the young Zuviria, and James Fitzjames, Earl of Berwick, the French (it's a long backstory) commander who takes Zuviria through his first campaigns and personal involvements. It covers a period with which the reader may be unfamiliar, but, with the help of many maps and drawings, and a cast of characters among the appendices, can help the reader understand this world s/he's now immersed in, so it doesn't matter if the reader didn't know this period, which they'll feel.Perhaps it's best that this is set in the first years of the 18th Century, an obscure period well away from the more-trodden Regency or Victorian novels. The author has done enough research and background to give us a world as complex, vast, exotic and dangerous as that, say, of Tolkien's Middle Earth, its inhabitants memorable and its social dynamics stark. Its vistas, its smells, its squalor, its violence will immerse the reader, particularly in the final devastating third of the book, in the 1713-1714 siege of the city of Barcelona.Zuviria himself is 98 years old when he narrates this story. We know this in the opening pages as he dictates his story to (and insults now and again) his scribe, Waltrud. We know he'll survive, but once into the novel it seems like he won't, not after the dangers and treachery he passes through. And it is through his expertise we can see the course of events, spelled out in the engineering that dictates the siege's course. We come to see the siege as a devastating and central event in Catalonia's history.The English-language translation seems flawless, with no false notes; it has succinct prose and a clear voice. Given the length and scope of the book, it's no small accomplishment: the book doesn't drag.This is truly epic in scope and literary quality. Highest recommendation to those interested in historical fiction, in Catalonia, in Spanish history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A4AJANO4B76B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062323962#wasThisHelpful","R2A4AJANO4B76B","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Among alternate-history novels, and I've read a number of this kind of speculative fiction, this book starts with an interesting premise: the Roman Empire is still very much expanding in AD 1218 -- _the_ Roman empire, not the Byzantine (eastern) remnant that, in our world, held out until 1453. What's more, the main character, Gaius Marcellinus is leading a legion deep into the New World from his base in Mare Chesapica. The author doesn't entirely spell out how this alt-history world came to be, we're left to guess from the story and some sketchy appendices -- Geta, rather than Caracalla, becoming emperor ten centuries prior, or maybe the fact that the ""Christ-Risen"" cult is now simply one more god in the Roman pantheon. There's more: the Cahokian (""mound builder"") civilization in mid-continent seems to be stronger, better-organized and technologically more advanced, very much so, and we're left simply to guess how that came to be (in our world, Cahokia would decline after a little ice age beginning in the 1300s). So, Marcellinus' encounter with Cahokia ends in military defeat -- but he survives and becomes part of his captors' civilization, and the book -- and from the looks of it, a trilogy -- begins.The story is fast-moving, the prose succinct -- even vivid, at times -- the details good but not burdensome, the other characters interesting and credible. The Cahokian civilization we now inhabit seems to be cohesive and consistent, even believable within its premise. Given that a stronger Iroqua civilization is menacing the Cahokians, Marcellinus has work to do for his new hosts, even knowing that Roma may reappear one day. For readers interested in Rome, or alt-history, this is a compelling and worthwhile read, set in a believable world, with more to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DPXQVEV7L7CR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804177228#wasThisHelpful","R3DPXQVEV7L7CR","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the third in a series, The Golden Throne can stand on its own, as this is the story of the legendary Plantagenet-era knight, William the Marshal (or, here, Guillaume le Marechal). The stories of swordsmithing and falconry in Katia Fox' previous two novels, The Copper Sign and the Silver Hawk, are a subplot within this story, something of a prequel. The main plot follows the Marshal's life beginning with him as a squire, and follows him through the dynastic wars and tournaments of several British-Norman kings, Henry II, Richard I, John and into the reign of Henry III, although the story mainly is about the personal rivalries that Guillaume attracts during his career. The author has researched the period well; certainly, readers of Thomas Costain's histories of the Plantagenets will find familiar settings. In all, a readable and adventurous historical novel for those interested in the period.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L6X4IRVAVOBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611090385#wasThisHelpful","R3L6X4IRVAVOBV","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:13 MinsThis is my second tablet; our household already has a Nexus 7. This unit powers up fast, has a vivid and easily readable display, and has good wireless access to my home router even on the far side of the house. When setting up the tablet for first use, the tablet itself highly intuitive and user-friendly, although the online account setup can be balky. Any missteps in first-time entry on the ASUS online account may cause ASUS to (1) tell you your password is invalid but (2) refuse to reset password through the normal process because there is no such account. Try using an alternative e-mail address and that should work, but try to be slow and careful with this part of the setup.The unit ships with a very brief little paper manual, along with a micro USB cable (male-to-male) and an AC power adapter (into which the USB cable will plug). The USB cable will also allow your tablet to physically connect with, say, your laptop or desktop if you with to exchange files or software.Users can download a manual at http://www.service.asus.com/ (go to ""download drivers, BIOS, manuals and firmware""), look for ""memo pad 8"", and you'll find (at this writing) 33 PDF manual files, in various languages including English (""version E8492"" is the manual, not the model, number). This manual is helpful, well-designed and should answer most questions. It's a lot more helpful than the little flyer that comes in the box.Battery durability is excellent and I haven't had to plug the AC charger yet; interaction with PC USB ports has given more of a recharge than I had expected. I have had a MicroSD chip (not included) in this unit for some time as well and haven't noticed any significant battery drain, at least not of the sort that other reviewers mention. The tablet ships with a large number of apps, some immediately useful (e.g., the Chrome browser). Its type pad is fairly easy to use on a screen this size, though I've found the microphone to be helpful -- and responsive -- for voice commands.Two minor quibbles: I'm getting a slight crackle at times from the tablet speaker. This may be my own learning curve as to its sensitivity; I do notice if I use headphones with a mini-stereo jack (which the tablet accepts) the sound is flawless. Other problem is that the screen is fairly reflective, which can be a slight problem, and it does collect fingerprints.Overall, a good basic tablet.

"This book is something of an environmental case study -- three, in fact -- and a compelling lesson in economics and marketing, told through three simple foods and their sources: oysters in the New York City estuaries, shrimp in Louisiana and the oil-stained Gulf of Mexico, and salmon in far Alaskan waters. The author, as we see, has first-hand experience with the people and fisheries in all three areas and his report, from the scene, is compelling -- and concise and highly readable.It's not just a story of environmental damage, though he tells it plainly enough: the pollution and sewage in New York harbor, the oil spill in the Gulf, and the threat of the gold and copper Pebble Mine proposal to the salmon fisheries in Alaska. We learn just how badly our export of our remaining seafood -- and our import of cheaper seafood, such that it is, from Asia and elsewhere -- has distorted our own fisheries, our food industries and our nutrition. We learn just how many local jobs and industries are affected, and we see, more clearly, just how much economic damage goes hand-in-hand with environmental degradation.It is reversible, he says, but it will need a major change in mindset. This book helps; certainly the reader will think differently about what's on the dinner table. And the author is hopeful: ""All that the sea asks of us,"" he writes, ""is that we be wide in our harvest, recognize the limits of its bounty, and protect the places where seafood wealth is born. In return the sea will feed us and make us smarter, healthier, and more resilient in the process. Quite a covenant.""Highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OIPJKHB4AIC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204489#wasThisHelpful","R2OIPJKHB4AIC2","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a brilliant, but simply-written, story of where our civilization is now, or at least, six of the things we take for granted: glass, cold (refrigeration and more), sound, clean (that is to say, cleanliness), time, light.Some of it seems fairly obvious: glass, of course, and the profound changes it would cause once people could make it -- a printing press meant more with eyeglasses which people could read by, not to mention lenses for microscopes and telescopes with which to study everything from bacteria to the cosmos. Johnson also shows us the subtler changes glass wrought in society, fiber-optics in our day, and the surprising effect of the simple mirror, when it appeared.So it is with refrigeration, and the author shows us its first beginnings in cutting and transporting ice from wintry climes over long distances, and its surprising commercial success in the 19th Century. We learn about the inventors, Clarence Birdseye -- who would pioneer methods of freezing and transporting food, and keep it appetizing -- and Willis Carrier, whose work in air conditioning would spark major population movements and economies.We learn about sound, and the minds that advanced it: Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Lee De Forest, and Bell Labs, all well-known but it's still a fascinating story. The author shows how their inventions built on previous, if incomplete, tinkering -- and, just as important, the marketing of these new technologies, which could advance some inventors and stymie others.We get a lesson in urban planning with cleanliness, for we see how cities could not grow without potable water and efficient sewage systems, or effluent-borne disease -- typhoid, cholera and such -- would impose its own deadlly limits. We see that level sites like Chicago, where drainage would be difficult, would require inventive new engineering to make the cities livable -- along with artificial light. Johnson shows us how fast we've come from whale-oil lanterns to neon, the laser and the bar-code scanner. And in these last two chapters we learn how invention builds on invention -- even Edison's light bulb would only be the ultimate try at a practical (and marketable) light bulb.In all, it's a truly fascinating story of what underpins our lives today, and a lucid, easy-to-follow explanation of the science, urban planning, marketing and sociology behind it. That Johnson can muster this much science and make it understandable, intriguing and relevant says much for his literary quality -- not just his science.Highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SRD1EPRACTB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594632960#wasThisHelpful","R3SRD1EPRACTB6","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a quirky but original approach, but perhaps it's the best way to go at it -- how indeed would an author describe what we see when we read? Rather than say it in words, which could very well be dry or convoluted, this author has taken a scrapbook approach, a collage of short text, pictures, sketches and concepts. It works; the result is a lively and thought-provoking look at the process of reading. It's a fast read but worth re-reading later, as the insights are many and often profound. I also recommend this book for the young adult category, not just for adults, as it says much about a thought process, and an important personal skill.

"This is a well-illustrated history of railroads that is much more than a coffee-table book. Although very well-illustrated -- photos, maps, diagrams -- the text, in a series of brief (2-8 pp. usually) articles, chart the history of world railroading from its obscure beginnings in the 18th Century to the present day. It charts the technology from early steam to maglev trains, the industry from the early ventures to transcontinental adventures in America and Siberia, to the new ventures like the Channel tunnel and the Tibet railroad. The book doesn't shy away from controversy and worse -- the rail barons' financial misbehavior, the rail disasters, the railroad atrocities in WWII involving the Burma-Siam railroad and the Nazi Holocaust. It talks about engineering marvels in the Alps and India, and economic drivers like the Cuba sugar railways. There's even a technical glossary in the appendix.Highly recommend.

"This is the story of five French refugees from the 1790s revolution ‚Äì Talleyrand, Liancourt, Naoilles, Moreau and Volney ‚Äì and their influence on Philadelphia society. Philadelphia was, in Washington‚Äôs presidency, the US capital city and the center of its commerce and culture. The French √©migr√©s would enrich, educate and charm Philadelphia society ‚Äì glittering figures like Anne Bingham, who would become a major figure in society in Philadelphia, Paris and London. We see how Philadelphia would also form links to sympathetic figures like Lord Landsdowne (prime minister after Yorktown) and the rising financial house of Baring. Indeed, Alexander Baring would marry the Binghams‚Äô daughter, and Gilbert Stuart‚Äôs portraits would serve as another relationship, we learn.Indeed, the author shows how letters of introduction, in this pre-telegraph, pre-Post Office period, would serve to form relationships among these select luminaries, even into the American frontier. We see French (and, later, Dutch) √©migr√© influence on the American backcountry grow in the 1790s, through capital and settlements. The author‚Äôs grasp of geography, demography and economic flow is crucial in this story, a key period in the Republic‚Äôs formation and expansion, driven, we‚Äôre told, by these Europeans‚Äô riches. We see land successes and failures in Pennsylvania and Maine ‚Äì utopian colonies form and decline, fortunes made and lost at a time when US national finances were weaker. We see the detached, almost separatist nature of the trans-Appalachian frontier at the time of the Whiskey Revolt. We even see British capital help buy, and grow, upstate New York.The French emigres‚Äô interest in the trans-Mississippi west ‚Äì the Louisiana territory ‚Äì would not be as friendly to the United States, we learn. Then under the tentative rule of Spain, this area would attract intrigue from the √©migr√©s and a series of French governments, ending up with Bonaparte‚Äôs. We see how the slave revolt in Haiti would affect the fate of Louisiana, that Noailles would play a blood-drenched role in the Haiti revolt, and that Talleyrand, now Napoleon‚Äôs foreign minister, and Alexander Baring would serve critical roles in the eventual fate of the Louisiana territory.Highly recommend as a well-researched, warmly-written perspective on the formative years of the Republic, peopled by brilliant and unforgettable characters.

"This work not only tells us what London was like in those times, but it places Dickens ‚Äìman and boy ‚Äì in that London, in the places he saw and experienced, and it also carefully places Dickens‚Äô various books among those landmarks. It puts Dickens in context, his books in context, and places us in that city. ‚ÄúDickens‚Äô London was a place of the mind, but it was also a real place. Much of what we take today to be the marvelous imaginings of a visionary novelist turn out on inspection to be the reportage of a great observer.‚ÄùIn a way, the title‚Äôs slightly misleading. As the author points out, Dickens was born under George III and lived through the Regency period ‚Äì a different period ‚Äì before Victoria came to the throne in 1837. Victoria and her times would last over 30 years after Dickens‚Äô death in 1870. This London, in this book, is dirtier, rowdier, more dangerous, and more lively than the stereotypical Victorian society, more Hogarth than Sargent.It‚Äôs a good companion for any reader who has enjoyed Dickens‚Äô work, as well as to those who are students of the social, economic and literary history of the period. Certainly it will be valuable to scholars of those times, and Ms. Flanders has provided formidable references in the footnotes and bibliography. Yet it is readable, and human ‚Äì it shows us the people of London, alive, vivacious, raucous. It‚Äôs not just the times or the events or the buildings.The book tells us how they traveled, in a time when the coach, and its hazards and discomforts, gave way to the early Underground and to the railways. It tells us how Londoners sought entertainment, whether formal or street theater (the latter being fires, building collapses, the occasional execution). We learn how, where, and what people ate ‚Äì pubs, chop-houses, and even a form of what we now call fast food, the ‚Äúslap-bang‚Äù establishments for workers on short breaks. We find out that many lower- and middle-class housing didn't have cooking facilities and had to send out their cooking -- or buy it from vendors on the street. We see the vendors themselves selling all manner of goods and services, from oysters to chimney sweeping. The book even touches on the sexual activity of the time, prostitution in its various forms in particular.The book is a splendid social history of the period ‚Äì London ca. 1830-1870 ‚Äì but it‚Äôs also a wonderful companion to readers of Dickens. The author places the characters in this London context and they now seem more alive, more true-to-life ‚Äì David Copperfield, Pip, Mr. Pickwick, and the rest. They seem more real, and in surroundings more real in sight, sound, smell. We see more of the hazards lurking in the streets, in the fetid water, in the dank air, and we see more of the human interactions, from cookshop to street seller to horse-drawn and railway coaches.This well-researched book is indispensible as a study of London social life and infrastructure in the years of transition from Regency to Victorian times. It's also a must-have for those who cherish Dickens' writing, and this book belongs on that shelf.Strongly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UEKJCWK0A8ZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250040213#wasThisHelpful","R3UEKJCWK0A8ZL","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this for several weeks now and found it handy for checking if chicken pieces were safely cooked. The probe is long enough that my hand is not too close, although the thermometer does take a few seconds to get up to full temperature. I've also tried it on a pork roast that had a more sophisticated digital thermometer (long wire, timer, alarm etc.) and the temperature readings were within 0.4 degrees F ‚Äì not bad at all. You may still want a thermometer with a longer probe and a wire running outside the oven to a more comprehensive reader, but this little device is a quick, simple and handy method and should be in your kitchen drawer.I have noticed one slight drawback; the digital readout will time-out after maybe 10 seconds.

Also, the temperature doesn't fall off too rapidly, so the ""hold"" button, while guaranteeing accuracy, is simply an extra safeguard. The shield (scabbard?) for the probe is durable and will protect the probe against reasonable hazards in the drawer or on the counter.Recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6MMPZMPKE09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARIPRQ2#wasThisHelpful","RD6MMPZMPKE09","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:36 MinsI live in a scenic area that has a lot of bird sightings, particularly raptors, as well as scenery and occasional fly-overs by vintage aircraft on excursion flights. I had a very real need for lightweight binoculars that balanced power, field and clarity. I already had, for comparison, Cabela 10x25 roof prism binoculars -- similar to these binoculars -- as well as war-surplus 7x50 conventional binoculars. These binoculars seem to have the best combination of features I've seen so far. Its field is wide enough that I can quickly find flying objects, and its power and clarity -- esp. its light-gathering capability -- makes it ideal. Its light enough to rest around my neck without fatigue, and has easy L/R-eye focus. It has a wider field and brighter picture than the 10x25s and the eye cups, which screw out (with soft clicks) rather than pop up, are better and can be set to intermediate. (See video review for demo).The binoculars come with a very rudimentary set of instructions -- seemingly generic for all types of binoculars and several languages. The product included a lens cloth and a soft, unreinforced cloth (velcro-closure) carrying case/pouch (but with no belt clip). The neck strap needed assembly. A solid (and loose-fitting) cover protects the eyepieces when its in the case, and there are snug-fitting lens caps for the front end, caps that look like pince-nez (as another reviewer remarked) but can protect the binoculars. The front lens caps do have a slot that can take the neck strap, so the user can undo the covers and keep them handy, a nice touch, and which makes it easier to carry the product in a ""protected"" mode (caps on) rather than in the (problematic) pouch. The binoculars have a rubberized body coating that is nice, in a tactile sense, and seem to protect the body reasonably well.All in all, a superb set of binoculars for field use, with a good balance of features. Strongly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAC4R95YTNT8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DYQRME#wasThisHelpful","RAC4R95YTNT8S","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The title and cover are slightly misleading: this isn't a history of the U.S. industrial effort in World War II, and not so much about FDR or even the Ford Motor Company. What this book is about is three generation of Fords: Henry, his son Edsel, and grandson Henry II. It's about Ford's (and the Fords') part in the B-24 Liberator bomber program, and about the enormous Willow Run factory they built to produce the aircraft. And, it's about Charles Lindbergh's part in this program.The author has provided good background, and we see the past history of the Ford Motor Company through the life stories of Henry and Edsel Ford. This includes some critical material about Henry Ford's notorious anti-Semitism (an influence on a younger Hitler) and the Ford company's expansion into Europe, where, under Nazi occupation, Ford plants would make considerable numbers of German army trucks. All this was one complication when FDR wanted the auto industry to convert to war production and put the auto aside.We learn of other difficulties: building a monstrous plant in rural Michigan and only then realizing that, given wartime housing and gasoline shortages, that they had neglected to provide worker housing near the plant or a means of daily commute. We learn of worker shortages because of the military draft, and racial and gender barriers to hiring African-American and female workers. We learn of serious theft in the plant. We learn that Edsel, now company president, was coping with a dangerous illness while confronting all this. They had promised a bomber a day, and it wasn't happening, at a time when the Allies were losing and this big aircraft was badly needed.It's also about the struggle between Edsel Ford, Henry's son, and Harry Bennett, the thuggish enforcer Henry hired to break strikes and act as a lieutenant in the Ford Motor Company. This struggle would last through the Depression and through the Willow Run years and would be a factor in the success or failure of the B-24 program. The reader is never sure how this power struggle would end.The author has done a fine job consolidating all these narratives in a concise story, putting it in the context of American wartime industrial mobilization, and doing it in a way that maintains the focus on the plant, the bomber, and the remarkable (if flawed) business leaders that fought this battle. It's told in a readable and dramatic way. And he seems to have had good access to contemporary news and company archives to convey a sense of the times.An important contribution to business and WWII home-front history. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2470K19CBBFD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547719280#wasThisHelpful","R2470K19CBBFD4","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read the book through, and can say that if you ignore the conclusory opening and closing chapters -- the flawed premises that the marriage revolution started in 2008 and that this was a decisive victory at the Supreme Court -- it's OK as a courtroom drama. The Proposition 8 Federal trial and appeals takes up most of the book and once the case gets going, her narrative is straightforward enough. She did seem, according to her source notes, to have access to attorneys Ted Olsen and Charles Cooper, to Hollywood activist Rob Reiner, and to Judge Walker, whose personal reflections are perhaps the one big revelation in this book.Just as background, I was one of those pushing domestic-partner (registry) ordinances 20+ years ago, and took a low-level part in the No on 8 campaign and saw its inadequacies. I was one of 18,000 marriages done in mid-2008 and at risk if Prop 8 passed. Still, it's irksome for her to conclude that the struggle only started in Nov. 2008, when in fact lawyers Olsen and Boies (and Ms. Becker, for that matter) happened to get into this story just as they reached a tipping point, after all the years of incremental and concerted work by others. And it's worth noting that this case's final outcome was something of a fizzle: the Supreme Court invalidated Prop 8 only on a matter of standing, not the merits, and the decisive case that session was Windsor v. U.S., which invalidated the Federal anti-marriage law, the so-called Defense of Marriage Act.Perhaps Ms. Becker couldn't have known that Edie Windsor's case would empower a new wave of Federal rulings on state anti-marriage-equality laws, which only now (spring 2014) are reaching circuit-court level and heading for the Supreme Court. Still, it would be nice if we had the same kind of book about Edie Windsor and the anti-DOMA cases that paralleled hers, or, for that matter, it would be good to see a stand-alone memoir by Judge Walker.So, this serves simply as a trial story, written in a newspaperish and somewhat dramatic way. It's not the final story, nor does it help the reader appreciate what this story is in full context (see, e.g., Victory: The Triumphant Gay Revolution by Linda Hirshman for histories of the movement). For that matter, given Ms. Becker's invocations of Harvey Milk (or his City Hall bust) it would help to read Randy's Shilts' The Mayor of Castro Street to realize just how far the movement came from 1978 to 2008. But you, the reader, will have to do that reading, and I wonder if she did.Like the Supreme Court ruling on this case, this book ends up being about procedure. Not the merits.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D80QAONR4LRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204446#wasThisHelpful","R3D80QAONR4LRD","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who has planned for years to visit Rome, has learned the language, and looked at numerous travel guides, I must say that this is perhaps the best one I‚Äôve seen so far. It‚Äôs succinct, portable, laid out in a logical and user-friendly way, and practical. Most of the book is devoted to the city‚Äôs neighborhoods, chapter by chapter (with color-coded tabs) with an eye to walkability. Amongst these pages are separate essays on amenities and background (blue pages) and suggested walking tours (green pages).The book is well and attractively illustrated, with full-color photos, sketches and plans of major buildings, and ‚Äì invaluably ‚Äì plenty of street maps, easy to read and reasonably detailed. The rear cover includes a full schematic of Rome‚Äôs tram, subway and suburban rail systems.The book mainly focuses on the city but has a couple chapters on excursions outside the walls: the larger city and attractions in the nearby region (the Alban Hills, Tivoli, Ostia). And it has a full and up-to-date appendix on the city‚Äôs hotels, restaurants, shopping, public transportation, as well as tips on visa requirements, practical attire and seasonal climates. The book isn‚Äôt as comprehensive as, say, the Companion Guide to Rome but it‚Äôs a good overall guide, practical, and, if you pack it with you, portable, thanks to its size and layout.Highly recommend to anybody even thinking of a trip to Rome.

"This is not a traditional military history, though it does tell about the battle's events. This book's value is to place Verdun in perspective -- why they fought, rather than how, and what France and Germany took away from it, from that time to ours. It is helpful in telling the reader why the Germans chose that place and an offensive in that manner, and why the French responded as they did. Mr. Jankowski does examine, and sometimes debunk, the later characterizations of the battle, notably, that ""attrition"" may not have been the real reason behind Gen. Falkenhayn's strategy -- even given Falkenhayn's own attempt, postwar, to re-characterize his actions. We learn how the battle affected, and, more important, was affected by, combat on other parts of the Western Front and elsewhere. We learn more about the battle in context of German and French soldiers' morale (both armies would mutiny later on). And we learn some surprising perspectives: the main battle of Verdun may have run out by the end of 1916, but the front remained active and when the Americans attacked in that sector in 1918, we're told, they used 3,000 guns to start the attack, far more than Falkenhayn's 1200 or so.The book is succinct at 265 pp. and the author seems to have done considerable and original research in French and German archives, particularly on casualty numbers, military postal censorship and civil-military relations on both sides. He makes good use of soldiers' letters, diaries and memoirs, and not just of those who survived the war but those of the dead. In all, it's an original and new look at Verdun and the wider war, and its legacy to this time, a century on. Highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EAVBQMV6P4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199316899#wasThisHelpful","R3EAVBQMV6P4N","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This film is important in US cinematic history in that for once, just once, Hollywood shows the rebel side as The Enemy -- not a noble lost cause but the enemy, faceless and remorseless.

"The novel follows 12-year-old Petka through his misadventures and sometimes-dangerous mishaps. He's very realistically a boy -- energetic, impulsive, filled with fantasies about being a Soviet soldier. His life is bounded by his village of Razgulyaevka, the Soviet garrison awaiting the next offensive against the Japanese just over the border nearby, and the Japanese PW camp. A prisoner there, a doctor, provides a second point-of-view in this narrative, and some backstory on his life and family via his journal.The plot is more a series of episodes as the boy gets into various scrapes, whether smuggling liquor to the soldiers or adopting a wolf cub (which he names Fright) or dodging cuffs from his family and villagers, a fairly colorful set of Russian peasants. There are dark episodes; the boy has brushes with death, his and others'.In all, a good read, especially for those interested in Russian literature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M7F45RT53YLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611090733#wasThisHelpful","R3M7F45RT53YLD","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If anything, John Quincy Adams deserved to be remembered for a full lifetime of public service, rather than a one-term presidency stymied by his political and personal opponents. This book fills out that telling, drawing, among many things, on his personal diaries, begun at age 11 and maintained until his final weeks. The reader can appreciate his gifts of writing, speech and languages.He was to witness considerable history from a young age. Accompanying his father to Europe at 10, he would be with John Adams as the father represented the new United States in Paris and St. Petersburg, experience the hardships of travel in Europe of that time, and return to Harvard after an early life of study and adventure. We see him follow his father into diplomatic service as minister to St. Petersburg, befriending much of the diplomatic community and the court of Tsar Alexander I, and, later, as minister to Britain. He would play a key role in negotiating the Peace of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812, and, as Secretary of State, drafting the Monroe Doctrine.We learn about his ill-starred presidency, coming into office with no popular or electoral majority, and trying to do business at a time when political parties were re-forming and his own political base disorganized. We see just how political obstruction and personal rivalries among bigger-than-life personalities of the day -- Henry Clay, John Calhoun, Andrew Jackson -- would drive events and guarantee little progress (the start of the Chesapeake & Ohio canal was one of the few bright spots in this administration).And we see how the remainder of his public career, in the House of Representatives, would redeem him. He would be an early opponent of slavery at a time when, thanks to the ""3/5 rule"", slaveholding states had the ability to stifle debate on the subject in Congress. His role at the time was to push the debate, bring more visibility to something he knew would eventually bring disunion and civil war, something he knew he wouldn't live to see. We see the eloquence and skill he exerted when he argued the Amistad slave-ship case to the U.S. Supreme Court.The book ends with his death, by stroke, in the US House. Of the extended Adams family he would leave behind, especially Charles Francis Adams, who would go on to fame in his own right, it has no more to say -- and perhaps a biography of Charles Francis would deserve a sequel of this depth. Indeed, this book's prose is such that it reads like much less than its 570 pages or so, and the Biographical Essay that follows is a masterly review of the available sources on John Quincy's life and times.Highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A1LTQ1RAP47J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061915416#wasThisHelpful","R3A1LTQ1RAP47J","A17WM3NTCID9DS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17WM3NTCID9DS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read the first book in this series, Mary Hades, last year and loved it. It was a great paranormal read that kept me on edge the entire time. Possess was equally good, but felt very different from Mary Hades. This book has a very decidedly horror feel to it. It kept me up at night more than once until I had to stop reading it after dark!  Mary and Lacey's relationship is one that I love. They are such great friends. Reading about their strong bond is refreshing. I actually may like Lacey a bit more than Mary, but that's because she can be a bit snarky. It was so fun to check in on those two. I can't wait to do it again!  The setting of this book is what really got me. The house itself really becomes a character. The author did a fabulous job at pulling me into the story. The build-up with the diary was also really creepy! It was a nice addition to the story.  All in all, you cannot go wrong with this series.

I'm not sure if I just didn't like the writing style or some things got lost in translation, but the story really bottomed out and dragged for me.  I'm a very character driven reader. And these characters just didn't do it for me. Instead of connecting with Liv, I spent a lot of time frustrated with her. She didn't stop to think, and I wanted to shake some sense into her! There wasn't much on the romance front, either. There were definitely hints at something that may unfold in future books in this series, though.  The dream sequences were so strange for me. I think it may have been the translation. I felt like I would have liked them if they had been described more concisely, but they were too vague for me. Or maybe that's all because of my lack of interest in this book.  A lot of people are fans of this author's other series, and I think that group will enjoy this book.

"Ehhhhh. This book was weird. Some part of me wanted to like it, because it was a seriously interesting idea. But it fell so flat for me. I had issues with the characters. That's a huge deal breaker for me. But, hey. At least it was a quick read? (Except for the info dumping, that is.)  Patsy was annoying. I swear, if I had heard her talk about yarn bombing one more time... I would have stabbed her with a yarn needle. It's good to give characters depth. It's bad to have them fixate on one thing that gets endlessly repeated. I found it so hard to believe that a girl who's done some backwoods shooting can bloom into this kick-ass assassin. I had a hard time taking anything Patsy said, did, or thought seriously.  The biggest downfall for me was the romance. I really want to use air quotes for that. It just wasn't believable or swoony at all. Possible spoilers, y'all. (But not really 'cause you find this out early on?) Patsy kills Wyatt's father first thing. But he's like HEY-O, who cares about my dead pops?! There's some hottie assassin girl to chase, bros! And they kiss and insta-love and gag and killmenowstopitplease.  Hit felt like a conspiracy theorist dream, complete with all of the over the top and unbelievable twists and turns. There was insta-love, info dumping, and unbelievable characters. Basically, everything to make me dislike it. It wasn't the worst book I read, but it wasn't my favorite. There was a cute dog in this story, but even she couldn't save it.

Dell goes through a lot of development and changes in this book. It was very interesting to watch how she really bloomed in this book. I'm always a fan of strong characters and authors that know how to handle them. Bright Fire did not let me down in that respect!  There are so many great elements to this story. The secondary characters are so fitting and a wonderful addition to the story. MJ Austin really knows how to paint a picture with her words, and I got so lost in her descriptions. The only real downside was the beginning for me like I said. There are a few other places that could be tweaked to flow better, but overall Bright Fire is solid. I enjoyed it so much, and I think YA fans will as well!**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RFRY1WBPDPK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEGWRNA#wasThisHelpful","R1RFRY1WBPDPK8","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How sad I am that The Andromeda Series is over! It's been such an incredible dystopian series that reminded me why I love this genre so much. And Amy Bartelloni couldn't have created a better send-off than she did with The Scorpio Project. It was a bittersweet finish for me!  Oh my goodness. With each book, Amy Bartelloni built on her story and characters. In The Scorpio Project, all of her efforts came to fruition. There are a lot of unexpected happenings, and I was surprised until the end! Sera has shown so much growth; I couldn't be more proud of her. This story is hers, and she has owned it!  Fans of The Walking Dead and The Road will fall in love with this series. Young or old can flock to these pages and find something to identify with and pique their interest.

"I'm so hot and cold with this book! I LOVED the part that's set in Italy. It was magical. I truly felt like I was with Lucy on the streets of Florence and Rome. This book was a quick read, so that part wrapped up far too soon for me. The second part, set at Lucy's college during her freshman year, was where I struggled.  I think if I was younger, I would have had a different reaction to Lucy. Her careless nature and the way she danced with danger so willingly while travelling abroad made my heart skip a few beats. I think younger fans will overlook that aspect, though. The bickering between Charlene and Lucy left me perplexed. Both had valid points, but I couldn't help but want to shake some sense into both of the girls!  The romance between Lucy and Jesse is very much a whirlwind, and I admit that I got caught up in it. I was rooting for them from the get-go. WARNING: SPOILERS!!!!! It's an understatement to say I was devastated whenever Lucy got into a relationship with someone else at her college. And whenever that snowballed into Lucy cheating on her new-found beau when Jesse turns up out of the blue, I had a bad taste in my mouth. I feel like this is one of those situations where if everyone involved would have actually TALKED, things wouldn't have spiraled the way that they did.  All in all, Love, Lucy was a fun and quick read. It definitely struck me with the travel bug, and I scrambled to find other novels set abroad to read this year. I had some issues with Lucy, but overall I still enjoyed Love, Lucy a lot. Contemporary fans with wanderlust will enjoy getting lost in the pages of this book!**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O62398O4D5ZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316400696#wasThisHelpful","R1O62398O4D5ZX","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes you just have to indulge in a sweet romance that'll sweep you away, and Red Carpet Day Job is just that! There's enough humor to keep it lighthearted, and I loved the way this book made me feel. It's a guilty pleasure read that I couldn't say no to!  Tasha Cotter writes in such a way that you can't help but be swept up in the story. The descriptions are vivid and instantly put you alongside the characters. Speaking of characters, oh my gosh! They all felt so real and authentic. And they'll keep you guessing! I loved getting to know all of them, but enjoyed Sophie so much. She's the type of girl I wanna have a glass wine and chat with!  Red Carpet Day Job is the romantic adventure you've been waiting for, love addicts! Read it for yourself and find out if you're Team Nick or Team Scott.

"I was so happy to dive into Invaded and be reunited with Cara and Aelyx. They're one of my favorite YA couples, y'all! L'eihr was sort of shrouded in mystery in Alienated, and I was so glad to be able to experience it first hand through Cara's stay there.  For a big majority of the book, Cara and Aelyx were separated. That did kill a bit of the romance, but I think that the communication between them kept that spark alive and kept me interested. This book focused less on them meeting, getting over their differences, and falling in love and more on the world as a whole and their future together. Some of the decisions Cara made did make me scratch my head, but she's on a planet entirely unlike her own. The only tether she has to her home and herself is her brother, who leaves halfway through the book. Cara went through some intense changes, and I was happy with the way she handled them. She had a lot thrown at her in this book, and I felt like she responded strongly and true to herself. I still want to be besties with her!  Cara wasn't the only one dealing with a lot. Aelyx had his fair share of issues, too. Again, sometimes I wanted to shake him because I couldn't understand some of his decisions. But when you think about the immense pressure on his shoulders, the entire fate of the human race y'all, I realized that I would crumble under that. I think Invaded shows a lot more of who both characters are, and I like where Melissa Landers is taking them.  Some things that are hinted at in Alienated are brought more into focus in Invaded. The Jaxon storyline surprised me, but I liked it. I thoroughly disliked him and I'm curious to see if he'll pop up again. There is a lot of development for all of the characters, not just Aelyx and Cara. I hope to see more of that in the future!  All in all, Invaded was such an amazing follow-up to Alienated. It answered a lot of questions, but also left some of its own. I cannot how much love I have for this series. SciFi fans and skeptics of SciFi both need to read these books. They're perfect in every way, and my fingers are crossed for another book about Aelyx and Cara! I desperately need it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDHV7BURUVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423169492#wasThisHelpful","R3FDHV7BURUVY","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited to dive into this book after reading Double Life and get back into Razia's world! She's the epitome of what I look for in a female lead, and I love reading about her. S.

"I've only recently discovered Steampunk, and every story that I read in this genre makes me love it even more. The Perilous Journey of the Not-So-Innocuous Girl was such an adventure! This book is rich in so many things and lacking absolutely nothing.  The characters are what really made this story for me, though. Statham does such an excellent job at portraying everyone as their own individual person with real growth. Marguerite was simply perfect. I love learning about her and connecting to her. How I wish I could read another one of her adventures! I felt such a range of emotions when it came to her, but in the end, I adored her.  The secondary characters shined as well. There was the perfect balance with them. I was never too bogged down by their presence, but they were there enough for me to love them as well! I especially had a soft spot for Claude!  The Journey of the Not-So-Innocuous Girl is such a thrilling adventure. With Marguerite's growth and development, the title has a double meaning with so much promise. My only downfall with this book is the blurb. The cover is outstandingly beautiful, as is the story inside of it. I only wish the blurb were just as amazing for potential readers.

"I have loved the Infinite Love series, and I feel like Learning to Live is such a wonderful addition to it. Kira Adams writes with such emotion that you can't help but be drawn into the lives of her characters. Learning to Live was no different. It is packed with so much heart and soul. It's very rare that I get THIS attached to characters, but the author has such a way with making her stories seem so real.  Ciera was such a sweet character. I have a huge soft spot for her, and I had such an urge to protect her! Topher is her perfect match, and I loved watching their relationship blossom. Even though their love story is amazing, it also has a tinge of sadness to it. I dived in head first and wound up in tears by the end of the book. It's a bittersweet ending that you know is coming, but you still aren't prepared for it.  Readers will fall in love with Kira Adams after reading this emotional tale.

"I tried to love this book. I really, really tried. As soon as I heard about My Best Everything, I thought it'd be for me. Appalachians, moonshine, and a romance? Yes, please! But My Best Everything quickly became a letdown for me.  My biggest complaint with this one is that it seemed so damn long. It became such a chore to finish this book. I felt like I'd read for an hour and only get through 5% of it on my Kindle. For me, the writing style is what slowed this book down. It's written as a letter from the main character, Lulu, to the love interest, Mason. For the first few chapters, it was quirky and cute. I liked it. But after 15% of the awkward writing, I was completely over it. It would have been better to post a paragraph or two in letter form at the beginning of the chapters or something. Anything but the way it was written would be an improvement.  Aside from my issues with the writing style, I did find myself enjoying parts of My Best Everything. As a fellow Appalachian small town girl, I understood where Lulu was coming from and her need to spread her wings. There was a connection between us because of that. But what I couldn't understand were her decisions. Lulu was able to plot up a devious and lucrative plan to rake in money illegally. But she lacked so much common sense.  I know it sounds like I disliked this book so much. But I really didn't; I promise! My hopes were just a bit too high, I think. Teenagers will enjoy My Best Everything. It's got a slow burn romance that I enjoyed, a bit of finding yourself through illegal means, and the bittersweet feeling of being on the brink of adulthood. Overall, My Best Everything was an enjoyable read.

"What a strange book! I really loved the premise before I even started this book. Religious cults?! Sign me up. But I was let down with the delivery of this book. For starters, I was really confused by the inclusion of The Chronicles of Narnia. I know what it's like to have a deep love for a piece of literature. Yet the way that the author included Narnia was really strange. It didn't fit into the story. It didn't read like the rest of the story. It stuck out like a sore thumb and really slowed down the book.  The characters were really interesting. The author has a way with descriptions that made me feel like I was on the compound and getting to know the members. Reading about the leader, Ezekiel, was chilling. The author knew exactly how to portray him as the sociopath that he is. Eva was a strong character. I enjoyed her curiosity about the world outside of the compound and her spirit.  Down from the Mountain was a good read, but ultimately it left me wanting more. The book seemed really short, and I wasn't ready to let go by the time it ended. It seemed like Eva's story wasn't finished and the ending was rushed.

"Feb 22, 2015Review: Double Life by S. Usher EvansDouble Life by S. Usher Evans(Razia Series #1)Genre: SciFi[Goodreads | Amazon | Barnes & Noble]Piracy is a game. How much are you worth?Since she was a little girl, everyone - from her father to the Great Creator himself - told Lyssa Peate the same thing: she's worthless. But when she becomes the pirate bounty hunter Razia, she can see the price tag on her own head. Employed by one of the four pirate syndicates, she uses bank transactions and her considerable wits to capture rival members. At least, she would be if Razia's boss ever gave her a chance. It's a man‚Äôs world, and all she‚Äôs allowed to hunt are purse snatchers while she languishes on probation.To pay the bills, she's stuck in her old life as Lyssa, discovering and analyzing distant planets and selling them for cash. She's doing just enough to stay out of trouble, pretending to be continuing her father's mysterious research while away for long periods of time. Her slimy boss is always asking questions and even assigns one of her younger brothers, Vel, to intern with her. Already struggling to keep the balance between her double lives, she tries everything to rid herself of the kid......until the universal police mistake Lyssa‚Äôs intern for Razia's hostage.  I've been on such a space kick lately! Double Life was a book I was looking forward to, and S. Usher Evans definitely delivered. But this book wasn't just SciFi. It had a lot of depth to it that I appreciated. It added many extra layers to the story that made it stand out.  The one thing that stood out the most to me about the main character, Razia, was that she was relatable. Her story resonated so well with me and formed an instant bond between us. There is plenty of masterful character development to go around, and I was impressed with S. Usher Evans' handling of it. It was brilliant and so enriching to the story.  Double Life is an entertaining read that excels beyond its genre. Those who are not the biggest fans of SciFi will find something to love and latch onto in this wonderful story. YA readers will definitely be drawn to Razia and her world.**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28EP6QFRQNH6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXCR422#wasThisHelpful","R28EP6QFRQNH6R","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been so excited for this book! And L.A. Starkey did not let me down with Descent! As much as I don't want this story to be over, I felt like Descent was a perfect and satisfying good-bye to a group of characters that I've grown so close to!  Looking back to the first book in this series, I'm amazed at how L.A. Starkey has written this journey. The characters have grown in ways that I wouldn't have imagined when I started this series. There are so many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat while racing towards the end. Descent is the stellar ending that this series deserved.  I'm torn between being sad that the story is over and happy that I got to follow it. Descent is a bittersweet ending for me. I'm not nearly ready to let Sam and the others go.

"She Loves Me, He Loves Me Not was a beautiful story that evoked a bevy of emotions in me and made me fall in love with Pakistan and its culture all over again. With rich descriptions, I was swept away in this touching story of love against the odds.  Zoella is a sensitive soul, and I was immediately bonding with her. The relationship between her and Fardeen is anything but smooth. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that kept me on the edge of my seat in tears most of the time.  There are so many twists and turns in She Loves Me, He Loves Me Not. Some of them were so unexpected, but added beautifully to the story. Mahal was able to keep my interest easily and turning the pages as quickly as I could to unearth what would happen next.  This book invites the reader into not only the character's lives but Pakistan, as well. It was a wonderful representation of a beautiful country.

"First things first, look at the cover! It's gorgeous! Before I even looked at the blurb, I knew I'd read this book based on the cover alone. I'm a sucker for the girls in pretty dresses trend. And this one knocked it out of the park with that!  Moving on! The Jewel sounded eerily similar to a book that I read and loved last year, Perfected by Kate Jarvik Birch. As I read The Jewel, I realized that it was more like the love child of Perfected and The Hunger Games. While I enjoyed the latter two more, I still found The Jewel to be a satisfying read.  There were parts of it that were easily predictable, but that didn't take away from the story for me at all. It's rather simple to figure out how the story is going to unwind early on. But Ewing managed to sneak in a few twists that were much needed and enjoyed. The pacing was well done, and I found myself reading this book as much as I could throughout the day.  Violet, or lot 197, is a pitiful girl. She is one of few girls selected to be a surrogate for the royalty of her nation against her will. I found it absolutely barbaric how she and the other surrogates were treated. It's truly frightening to consider a world where the life of one is so easily discarded in such an open way for the advancement of an ""elite"" group. I had a lot of sympathy for Violet, and I was constantly hoping that her situation would improve.  There was an array of secondary characters that left a lasting impression as well. My concern for Violet was matched only with my concern for her friend and fellow surrogate, Raven. The glimpses of Raven's treatment that I got while reading were enough to cement my disdain for the royalty.The romance in this one was a bit of a let down. It didn't happen until much, much later in the story. And as soon as it did come up, it took off way too fast. Just not my taste, and I couldn't sense a real genuine connection between the two.

"What an easy and lovable read! As someone who put in their fair share of time in retail hell, Paper or Plastic had me laughing and nodding along as I read. The situations and customers that Lex is faced with whenever she unhappily takes a job at SmartMart are realistic without being too heavy or overdone. This book was the perfect mix of humor, reality, and romance!  Lex has a lot to deal with at home; an overbearing mother, a bratty little sister, a passive father, and an ailing grandmother. I found her to be more mature than I was expecting, and I was quick to fall into a comfortable place with her character. I felt like the romance between her and Noah was really fitting. It unfolded in an organic way at the perfect pacing! That can be rare in YA these days, so it was very much appreciated.  Even though Paper or Plastic is a fun read, it has surprising depth. It isn't over done or in your face, but when you look closely there's a hidden message about coming of age and growing up. I hope fans of YA contemporaries love it just as much as I have!**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M70QUTSY69QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KP8FDY0#wasThisHelpful","R1M70QUTSY69QN","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read both Pieces of Me by Kira Adams and Straight from the Heart by Breigh Forstner! This anthology is an amazing collection!Pieces of Me Review:Holy cow, y'all. Kira Adams has blown me away with Pieces of Me. I loved everything about this book. It's so real. There was an almost instantaneous connection between Peyton and myself. She struggles with so much, and I identified with her. I saw myself in Peyton. It was so easy to cheer her on and follow her story because of this.There are sprinklings of romance all over this book. The way that it finally comes together in the end left me with a ridiculous grin on my face. Like I said, I was totally team Peyton. My heart ached with hers, but I loved the way that Kira told her story. The romance is perfect and it's so fitting for this story. It was sweet at times and hard at times. Just like real life.I've been a fan of Kira Adams for awhile, but Pieces of Me took that to a whole new level. I'm so glad that she decided to tell the story of Peyton. And I cannot wait to follow Peyton's story with the rest of this series!Straight from the Heart Review:Straight from the Heart is an amazing story with tons of heart from Breigh Forstner. I'll admit at the beginning I was doubtful. It seemed a bit slow, but wow. Once I sat down with this book, I was drawn in and really enjoyed the story that Breigh shares in Straight from the Heart.

It isn't with the author or story. It's the cliffhanger! It was brutal. I need to know more! I'm really excited about following the rest of Bryn's story and reading more from Breigh Forstner.

"THAT ENDING. Holy cliffhanger and a half. You're killing me, Starkey! It killed me that I couldn't snatch up book three whenever I got to the end of Destroyed because I have become so enthralled by these books and so into them. I can already tell that this is a series that I'll revisit several times!  I loved all of the development in Destroyed. Not only did the story grow and drag me further into it, all of the characters showed a lot of growth, too. I think Sam showed the most, and I'm getting so attached to her! This book definitely made her stand out even more, and I cannot wait to see what the author does in the next book! I just know that I'll devour it!  At times, it feels like you can cut the tension in this book with a knife. The Gods are being all sorts of crazy. But Starkey balances it out perfectly with the adventures of the characters and their relationships. The pacing is really fantastic. It was such an easy read; no drag, no info dumps, and no eye rolls!  I'm so glad that I'll have book three soon! I truly am hooked on this series. It has everything that I love about YA novels and then some. I cannot wait to read more from L.A. Starkey.

"This book! Oh my word. To sum it up in one word: amazing! L.A. Starkey absolutely slayed me with Deceived. The author is a friend of mine, so I kept myself in the dark with reviews of this book. I'm so glad I did, because nothing could have prepared me for how much I'd love it!  Okay, so. I'm a vivid reader. I love whenever I can get lost in the world of a book. The author's writing was perfect for me. It was so easy to get swept up in the world. It was very fluid and descriptive. There was never that drag that I always dread in longer books.  I loved Sam! The mystery surrounding her kept me intrigued, but I was still able to relate to her. The relationships between her and Marcus and Nicholas were really surprising. The author doesn't make it easy in picking one of the brothers over the other. All of the relationships in this book are great, though. I enjoyed the dynamic between the characters. It all felt surprising.  All in all, I fell in love with this world! L.A. Starkey is such an amazing writer. It really shows. Deceived does end on a cliffhanger, so I immediately flew into the next book! This is one of my favorites books so far in 2015!

"There was a lot of depth to The Donor that shocked me. It wasn't what I expected at all, but that is not a bad thing! The story is told at alternating times by Casey. I found it to be a very clever and effective way of storytelling for Nikki Rae.  Casey's situation is a difficult one. At times, it was almost uncomfortable to read her thoughts and what she was going through. But that's what is important. Many people are facing situations similar to hers, and it gave me an even deeper respect for what people are willing to endure and sacrifice for their loved ones.  The Donor is an emotional rollercoaster culminating in a bittersweet end that left me at a loss for words. I devoured this book in one go at it. It captivated me. As heartbreaking as the ending is, I have to recommend this to paranormal fans and those who love a dose of reality with their books.

"As soon as I saw that this book was set in a sleepy town in the Appalachian Mountains, I just knew I had to read it. My love for my home goes deep. And Helena Shaw did not disappoint! Harvest Moon was a phenomenal paranormal read that highlighted a lot of the reasons why I love paranormal romances.  Dawn was an excellent heroine. She was very believable and relatable. I think the author did a wonderful job at writing her. I loved the relationship between her and Jase. Usually I shy away from instant connections, but the way their relationship played out was very organic.  All of the elements of Harvest Moon worked so well and cohesively together. The mystery is paced at such a good pace and I couldn't turn away from this book!

"Holy crap. Vivian Apple rocked my world! I read this book in just a few hours because I couldn't put it down. One of the things that really stood out to me and drove my need to devour this book was that it could really happen. With most dystopians and post-apocalyptic novels, I can go to bed knowing that society is still far from breaking down to that length. But with Vivian Apple at the End of the World, it could happen. A religious cult catering to America's thirst for everything patriotic and religious? Half-way there right now.  The road trip aspect to this story was really appealing. The mash-up of so many great things--road trip, religious cult, end of the world, coming into your own skin, and a strong friendship--are what made this book so great. It's the quintessential Young Adult novel. While it has all of these things, I never felt like they over-powered each other. Everything co-existed harmoniously and were woven together in such a way that only made the book that much more amazing.  Vivian Apple was such a great character. The way that Katie Coyle writes her is so great. Her growth is fluid and admirable, and I have so much love for her. She's strong and determined without being a Mary Sue. That's so rare in YA, y'all. The other characters are all really wonderful, too! I want to know more from Harp, Vivian's best friend. She was such a rich character, and I enjoyed her so much. There's even a hint of romance to make my sappy heart happy!  Katie Coyle has managed to put nearly everything I love about Young Adult in this book and tied it up with a neat little bow. It was an amazing read, and I cannot wait to get my hands on the sequel.

"Alex As Well was a rollercoaster that I did not want to get off of. It blew me away and rendered me speechless. While reading, my mind was constantly churning a million thoughts about Alex, gender identity, and the effects that our parents can have on us and us on them. There are so many elements woven into the very fabric of this story. I'm in awe of Alyssa Brugman.  Usually whenever I'm blown away by a book, I'll gush and post a million gifs. But it would feel silly to do that for Alex As Well. It deserves more. It's beyond complex and thought provoking. There were times that I laughed along with Alex. There were tears. And there was even a fair amount of frustration for Alex and his situation. I finished reading this book weeks ago, and I still think about Alex. Alex isn't just a character. Alex is the androgynous face in the crowd that you wonder about. Alex is that classmate that gets relentlessly teased. Alex is someone you probably know. Alex wasn't a character for me; Alex was real. And that made Alex As Well a little heartbreaking, too.  The way that Alyssa Brugman writes this story really is mind blowing. It was so realistic. Alex's mother made me so angry. I won't mention much because spoilers. But I absolutely hated her. I felt like she was just a horrible person through and through. Her concerns were with herself and not her child. Alex was facing monumental challenges, and the mother was only concerned with how it was affecting her, not Alex. Ugh.  I don't think you could find a better coming of age story that deals with such complex issues. Readers of all ages will find Alex As Well to be a thought provoking rollercoaster of emotions.

"Wow! is my first reaction to Witchcraft Couture. This is such an intriguing book and truly unlike any other that I've ever picked up. At first, I was worried if it'd grab my attention. But boy, did it! I was quickly swept up in the world of Oscar and his antics. The writing was so well crafted and I easily got lost in the pages of Witchcraft Couture.  Oscar is such a fitting character. He's full of life and character, and I loved that the story was written in a way to give such an intimate peak into his mind and life. I enjoyed the layout of the book, like a journal, and think it was clever of West to write this way.  Again, this is something entirely unique.

I didn't think it could get any better, but Gail Carriger has proved me wrong!***Spoiler Warning***  Oh my goodness. The train was such an adventure! I loved seeing everyone work together. All along I've been Team Soap, so I was so glad to see that he wound up in this book in the way that he did. Sophornia and Soap are my OTP, and the ending of this book had me on tense with tears in my eyes. I cannot believe Soap got turned! It was a crazy twist that I didn't see coming, but I loved!

"Etiquette & Espionage was my first foray into steampunk. It cemented my love of the genre and of Gail Carriger's writing! There were just so many cool things to discover! Airships, werewolves, mechanicals, and vampires, oh my! I still can't believe that I'd never dabbled in steampunk before.  Sophronia is my kind of girl! She was fearless when it came to asking questions and getting answers. I admired that in her so much. In the midst of her life being turned upside down, she stayed true to herself. She makes Etiquette & Espionage such a fun read with her refreshing characteristics. All of the secondary characters were wonderful, too! I was blown away with the way that Gail Carriger wrote all of them. They were all unique individuals and I loved every single one of them. (Except Monique. She's up to no good. Guarantee it.)  Gosh, can I just gush about how fun Etiquette & Espionage was? It was just a really good book. It was so easy to get lost in the world of Mademoiselle Geraldine's. It reminded me a lot of how it felt to get lost in the world of Harry Potter way back when. It required me to be present while reading, but it was just so fun. I know I need a new word, but that's really what this book was for me. It was an adventure!  With just one book, Gail Carriger has converted me.

"Y'all, I seriously cannot get enough of Sarah Daltry! She's quickly making a spot in my favorites list. Dust is so different than the first book of hers that I read, Backward Compatible. But it blew me away in just the same manner. She proved that she can hold her own in fantasy with this book. It was flawless. As a fantasy fan, I absolutely adored getting lost in Dust.  Sarah Daltry has a knack for world building and it shows. Her writing is so rich and descriptive that you find yourself lost for hours before you remember that there's a world outside your front door. I was mesmerized by Alondra from the very first page of Dust, and I have no regrets about it. She is such a thrilling character with so many layers that you'll have to stop yourself from racing through the book to uncover everything about her and the mystery surrounding her.  Dust is an immersive experience that will invite you in and steal you away for hours before I realize it. I cannot rave enough about Sarah Daltry's writing.

"I was kind of on the fence while reading The Hit List. It has most of the usuals for a New Adult contemporary romance. It was inspirational and enjoyable, but with enough drama that I gave this book some side-eye more than once. The premise is unlike anything else I've read before, though. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about ""The List"", but I was relieved that it didn't overpower the book and there was so much more to The Hit List than that.  There is so much tension between Luke and Sadie. You can just feel it jumping off of the pages. But. I just didn't like Sadie that much. There's a touch of instalust that soured me from the beginning. But as the book progresses, she grated on my nerves instead of growing on me. She's all about that drama... and I'm just not. Though, there is plenty of character development that shows off Nikki Urang's writing skill. Her ability to draw me into the world despite my reservations is a testament to that.  All in all, I think The Hit List is a solid New Adult read. Devout fans will fall in love with Luke and Sadie, I'm sure.

"Wow! Shana Festa has totally outdone herself with Asylum! I loved Induction, but Asylum blew me away. Just in the span of two books, I'm absolutely sold--hook, line, and sinker-- on Shana Festa's writing. This book picks up exactly where the last one left off and doesn't give the reader a moment to catch their breath before they're thrown back into the action. It is jam packed with nail biting moments that will haunt you the entire time you're reading!  One of the few things that bothered me with the first book was Emma herself. But that totally turned around during Asylum. I adore her and her snark. There are a lot of changes during Asylum. Some of them come on slowly and others just crash into you with no warning. It was really interesting to see how these changes played out with different characters. I was not expecting some of the things that transpired in more ways than one! There are new characters introduced in this book, too. Shana does a good job of making each of her characters their own person that are interesting to get to know.  As soon as I finished Asylum, I tried to figure out when the next book will be here. It was so fast paced and action packed that I flew through it. At times I wanted to slow down and soak it in more, but I just had to know what was going to happen next! There's not a single reason why zomb-fic fans shouldn't pick up Asylum.

"Mary Waibel kept me up all night with this book! Whenever I started Faery Marked, I immediately got lost in the world of Callie. The way that the author introduces the reader to the world in this book is so immersive. You can't help but be swept away by the vivid descriptions and wonderful writing.  Callie was a great main character. I really enjoyed following along for her, and it was so easy to root for her. There are a lot of unknowns and suspense with this book and the author does such a fantastic job at pacing to keep you turning pages. I was smitten with Reese from the beginning, and I loved learning more about him as the story went on.  Honestly I cannot wait until the next book in this series! Faery Marked definitely has me hooked, and Mary Waibel cannot deliver soon enough!

"Backward Compatible is the language of my people. Since Spyro came onto the scene, I've been a gamer. Console, PC; doesn't matter. Just give me a good storyline and something to kill. I knew I'd love Backward Compatible on premise alone. I didn't realize that I would feel such a connection to the story and characters that I was sad whenever I reached the last page. I need more Katie and George in my life. Hell, I'll even put up with Lanyon to do so.  Can we talk about Katie? I am Katie. Her dizzying addiction to video games and penchant for social awkwardness? That's me in a nutshell. Katie was such an honest character. So was George. The authors weren't apologetic in portraying these characters realistically, and I love them for it. Constantly reading about swoon-worthy guys and perfect heroines gets tiring. Having Katie and George was a much needed dose of reality. Their romance was amazing, too. It wasn't a kiss in the rain, instalove, we're perfect. It was awkward, unsure at times, and absolutely authentic. Geez. I love them.  Not only were the characters great, but the whole book was. It's filled with nods to geek culture that I appreciated. The chapters are titled as levels. I audibly squealed whenever I saw the last chapter was titled Boss Level. It was epic. And the writing. Both of these authors were phenomenal writers.  There are so many things that make Backward Compatible amazing. I could sit here and go on and on about it. It's just that good. One simply does not identify as a geek, gamer, or nerd without reading Backward Compatible.**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ODY7SSC7ABZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9XA4JK#wasThisHelpful","R39ODY7SSC7ABZ","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can we talk about the cover for a moment? It's pretty. It gives off a very Thirteen vibe. But I think it doesn't do this book justice. Besides two girls, it doesn't tie into this book in any way. I'm a cover person. I will go for a book more because of the cover than the blurb. So I was surprised whenever I read For Real. It was nothing like what I expected because the cover just doesn't work for this story.  Enough digressing from this review. Regardless of the cover, For Real was such a good read. As an only child, it made me feel like I had missed out on having a sister. Romance wasn't the focus for me. The relationship between Miranda and Claire was what I got invested in. At times it was tumultuous and I wanted to shake them both. But by the end of the book, I was over the moon happy to see how Alison Cherry had evolved and shaped their relationship. It was beautiful!  Okay. Much like reality television, which this book relies heavily on, For Real was full of drama and crazy twists and turns. After I got to about fifty percent, all of my ideas about what was going to happen went out the window. I just settled in and enjoyed the plot. And what a doozy it was!  Not only does the relationship between the two sisters grow, the sisters themselves grow. Alison Cherry did an excellent job at development all around with this book. It has made me excited to see what else she writes in the future! If you need a break from the run of the mill YA contemporaries, For Real is an excellent choice!**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22C3OHOLXP8KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCS4NSG#wasThisHelpful","R22C3OHOLXP8KM","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Y'all, I just cannot get enough zombie reads. I blame my obsession on Tracey Ward, and she's how I found out about Hannah Trank's Are We Dead Yet?. And wow! I adored this book. Trank's writing quickly put me in the mind of Tracey's Survival Series but she was able to put her own spin on things that made me so happy to have found yet another zombie author to count on!  Ariel was a character that I really enjoyed. From the very first moment that she was introduced, I knew I'd be rooting for her. She's a strong character and I love how the author writes her. There's hints of romance, and I like the way they are woven into the story. They never outshine the other parts; everything fits together in a realistic and intriguing way.  There is a cliffhanger and I gave my Kindle major side-eye whenever I got to it! But I'm already chomping at the bit for the next book in this series! Hannah Trank is a refreshing breath of fresh air and I cannot wait to see more from her. She has so much promise, and I cannot wait to continue this series.

"Oh my word. You guys, Sarah Buhl just gets it. The B√∂hme Series is the epitome of original and breathtaking romance. I was unsure how she would handle writing dissonance., a follow-up to penance. But she exceeded all of my expectations and absolutely blew my mind. dissonance. is what I've been waiting for.  This book moved at such an organic and fluid pace that I was swept away by it's prose. The author writes with such detail and attention that you can't help but feel the story leap off of the pages and capture your heart. There is so much attention paid to all of the characters that I felt like I was friends with them all. I already miss them and their stories.  Romance fans need to look no further than Sarah Buhl. With both penance. and dissonance., she's proved that romance can be found without all of the baggage that usually overwhelms the New Adult genre. This is such a beautiful story.

"Perfect World caught me completely off guard. I expected an LGBT romance set in a SciFi world. But what I go was a really deep book that focused on many different elements. While Adam and Eric's romance isn't the highlight of the book, it is still sweet and I enjoyed it. I actually like that the author paid more attention to the whole story instead of focusing on the romance.  The pacing was great.

"Ann Everett has a remarkable wit that made Tied with a Bow and No Place to Go a humorous and delightful read! Her writing instantly reminded me of Charlaine Harris'.

There is plenty of mystery and intrigue as the story unfolds, and I really felt like it was perfectly balanced by the wit.

"The GoodThe setting.The setting is what originally sold me on Compulsion. I have a long standing love affair with the Carolina coastline, especially anywhere around Charleston. Martina Boone nailed it with her portrayal of the area. Her descriptions were so beautiful that I was swept up in the story in a heartbeat. I felt like I was back in the midst of Charleston (just without the awful humidity). From the small town drama to the southern twangs, Compulsion was everything great about the lower states!The characters.Yes, yes, and yes. I'll talk about Barrie and Eight in a moment. Right now I want to rave about the secondary characters in Compulsion. Mark was everything perfection. The way that Martina Boone showcased his relationship with Barrie made my heartache. He was her mother, father, and confidant. I loved him. Aunt Pru was also great! The author did an excellent job at showing the adjustment she's going through with all of the changes. Martina Boone did not ignore any detail in this book and for that, I'm so thankful!Barrie and Eight. Eight and Barrie. Beight. Errie.Whatever we're calling them, I love them. Eight was a bucket full of swoon. Seriously. I very rarely swoon over a character in a book. I've never got behind the whole book boyfriend craze. But Eight Beaufort? Sign me right up, y'all! The way that the relationship between Barrie and Eight develops is perfect. It's a slow burn with not even a little hint of insta-love. REJOICE, y'all.Barrie.Jeez. I loved this girl. She was put into an impossible situation, and I admired her so much. Her curiosity and resolve really sold me on her. She isn't fainting onto a couch. But she isn't charging into battle all willy nilly either. She was so authentic. Thank you for that, Martina!Everything.Seriously. Compulsion was amazing. The thought and plot development in this book is incredible. Martina Boone is above all else, a story teller. And Compulsion was a story that I'm so glad that I got to read.

"I'm next door neighbors with North Carolina. Whenever I'm lying in bed, I can look out our deck doors and see North Carolina and the Smoky Mountains. And let me tell you, I felt like I was right at home whenever I read Dead Over Heels. Alison Kemper was able to capture the essence of my home and it only added even more to this incredible story. I instantly warmed to Cole and his southern ways.  I'm always a fan of a good zombie book. Though I can admit that a lot of them start to blend together at times. That's the thing with Dead Over Heels that I loved. There were some different aspects of this book that surprised me. I really appreciated Alison Kemper's deviation from the norm.  The romance in this book is sweet and not overbearing. It fits seamlessly into the story, and I enjoyed it immensely. Like I mentioned before, Cole was instantly a favorite of mine. It took a little longer with Ava, but she's a solid heroine. She is full of courage despite of setbacks that are out her control and scary enough without zombies involved. If you're a fan of the less gory types of zombie fiction or Tracey Ward, I really think you'll enjoy Dead Over Heels. Not only did it have zombies, but it also had the perfect amount of wit and romance.**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZHP6EFM8XA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NDZQ2O2#wasThisHelpful","R2SZHP6EFM8XA2","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Talk about a book that makes you sit up and pay attention! Lauren Sabel was quick to capture my interest with this original tale. From the opening when we're introduced to the darker side of life in Hollywood, you're left with a lot of questions that you want answers to. The suspense in Vivian Divine is Dead kept me riveted and on the edge of my seat!  Vivian was such a dynamic character! I thoroughly enjoyed getting a glimpse into her life. It's not a life that many of have experience with, so it was intriguing to get a behind the scenes look. The one thing that made me really like Vivian was her honesty. Yes, she whined her fair share. But she wasn't afraid to admit and own it. I'll take that over the psuedo-badass main characters who whine and pretend to be something that they're not.  All in all, I was enthralled with Vivian Divine is Dead. The ending was not what I had hoped for. I feel like there's so much more to the story. I didn't want to be finished with Vivian and Nick. (Speaking of Nick, you slayed me, Lauren. I need to know where he is!)

"So, I already mentioned above that the main character falls for someone of the same sex. It fueled my initial interest in this book. I'm relieved to say that J.S. Little didn't let me down. I was immediately drawn to Arc and I loved watching the sparks fly between her and Aimii. Child of Doors is the type of book I can get behind!  The characters are really what made this book so great for me. I went through a range of emotions while following along. I've been finished with this book for awhile, yet I can still recall the way that they made me feel. They became very real.  J.S. Little knows how to infuse horror and fear within the pages of his book. I'm an admitted wuss who has to sleep with the lights on after watching a horror movie. Child of Doors had the same effect on me. The horror wasn't over the top, just reaching out into the void to scare you. It was an intelligent prose that spiked a deep sense of foreboding and fear.

"Y'all, I love me some Karen Gordon. I absolutely adored the first book in this series, Burnouts, Geek, & Jesus Freaks. And for the same reasons that I loved that book, I fell in love with Popstars, Friends, & Lovers. Karen Gordon is an excellent writer. Once again, she was able to transport me back to a time when I was younger. She is able to capture emotions amazingly well. It sets the tone for the entire book and you can't help but be swept away in the story.  MG was always a character that I liked whenever I read the first book, and I was so glad to be able to learn more about her. I loved how the book started with a flash back to a scene in Burnouts. It gave me that instant connection to the characters again. This wasn't just a love story. It was a story about growing up and growing in to love. It was beyond beautiful and made me cry more than once. Karen did such a phenomenal job at capturing the reality of love with MG and Steve's story. Gosh. I loved it.  Just like with Burnouts, Popstars is a roller-coaster of emotions and everything good! With every book that Karen Gordon, her writing only strengthens. She has crafted such a beautiful book with Popstars, Friends, & Lovers.

"The GoodThe world building.Just whenever I thought I was impressed with the world building in The Prophecy, the first book in this series, I'm blown away again by Erin Rhew. The way that she evolves the world in The Outlanders is so amazing. She truly pays attention to detail and rewards the reader with a world that instantly welcomes you in and doesn't let you go!The storytelling.Erin is a storyteller above all else. Just like her world building sucks invites you in, her writing does too. The flow of The Outlanders made it such a cohesive transition from The Prophecy. I was able to pick right back up where I left off and be consumed by Layla's world.Layla.This girl is my type of heroine. There are so many twists and turns, but I loved following those with Layla. She's everything you want in a heroine. Erin does such a brilliant job with all of the characters, but I think Layla really shines.The length.At 249 pages, The Outlanders is shorter than most fantasy novels. But I am SO thankful for that. The issue I usually have with fantasy is that it never ends. Books turn into tomes. But Erin is able to write an incredible novel in half the pages. That's remarkable.The BadBad and Erin Rhew just don't belong in the same sentence.The In-betweenNa-da!

"Holy crap.What was that?!  You have to know that you'll never find a book like The Collector's Society. It was unlike anything I've ever read or heard of. I had some doubts because of that, but they were quickly dismissed. Within just a few pages, I was sold. It's been awhile since I stayed up late and squeezed in reading time where ever I could find it for a single book. The Collector's Society sucked me into Alice's world and didn't let me go.  The plot in this blew my mind. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'll keep things general. It's just something that you have to experience it firsthand. It's a must. All of the characters in this book are great in their own way, but Alice really stands out. She was a culmination of all things good and epic without being a Mary Sue. It was a tough feat, but Heather Lyons seriously blew my mind.  There are so many elements to this book, and I feel like they are all so fluid in this book.

"What an enjoyable book with some twists and turns that I didn't see coming. The Empress Chronicles is told in alternating points of view; one present day, one historical 1800s. This brought a unique edge to the story that I rather enjoyed. I could definitely see people on the younger end of Young Adult loving this book.  The one thing that got me was the pacing. Though Suzy Vitello is a wonderful and inventive writer, I struggled a bit at the beginning to get into this story. Regardless, both characters are very intriguing.

"Wow. The emotion in this book surpasses the first, and I was blown away. This book is so much more than teen romance. It's about self-discovery and self-acceptance. It was a beautiful and encouraging story.  At first, I was weary of reading this once since it's the same story as Ella's but told from Ayden's point of view. It didn't feel that way whenever I read Ayden's story, though. There is so much substance that you really get swept away and forget that it's a retelling.

"So. This is one of those books that I'm on the fence about. As soon as I saw voodoo, New Orleans, and Young Adult, I was like sign me right up.  Don't get me wrong. I got those things. But something felt off. For starters, it was a slow beginning. It felt like a chore to stick around long enough to get into the story. Lucy was a hard character to follow. She wasn't outwardly bad. But I struggled a lot to rationalize some of her reactions and actions. I wanted more from her I think. I still don't exactly know what I wanted from her. Just something different than what I got. I will say that some parts of this book were so haunting that I was legit scared while reading and had to turn on a lamp.  The romance, and I'm using that term lightly, left me wanting for a lot more. It was predictable and boring. I never got behind Alex and Lucy as a couple. It felt like an afterthought that the author completely got into then forgot all about. Maybe that was the problem with this entire book. It felt underdeveloped. It read like a first draft instead of an ARC copy.  I feel like Lisa Maxwell had good intentions with Sweet Unrest. The plot could work so well. But it would need a lot of attention for me to give it another go. It has everything I'd want in a book about New Orleans. But the delivery fell short of my expectations.

"I am simply not the target audience for this book and that weighed heavily on my enjoyment of this book. Generally, I can enjoy books from different genres than my usual favorites. But that was not the case with The Opposite of Maybe. It wasn't able to draw me in like most chick lit titles. Everything seemed to happen because it needed to for the book and not organically for the characters. If I had to describe The Opposite of Maybe in one word, it'd be predictable.  The characters weren't particularly likable. They were flawed in all of the right places, but something about this set of characters just grated on my nerves. Maybe I am too used to my beloved Young Adult genre characters to appreciate Rosie, Jonathan, and Co. There was too much back and forth for the love triangle. Yes, a love triangle. Maybe that's why I just couldn't sympathize or connect with Rosie.  I could see this book being in someone's beach bag or stowed away in a carry-on for a light vacation read.

"The zombie books I normally read aren't what you'd expect. They're not the norm for zombies. I've never watched The Walking Dead. Basically, I'm the worst zombie fan in the traditional sense. This is why I was nervous about reading Shana Festa's Induction. I was afraid I was going to be a good audience for it. And I felt a bit intimidated by reading a traditional zombie novel.  But you know what? All of those worries were unfounded. I found myself lost in the pages of Induction quickly. Shana Festa is such a talented writer that I felt surrounded by her world within a few chapters. I was on the edge of my seat as I read this book. Festa was able to incite a very real feeling of fear when it comes to her take on a zombie apocalypse.  The inclusion of Daphne, Emma's beloved dog, was such a sweet touch. At times, I doubted Emma. She wasn't the easiest character to like. But her resolve and utter badassness redeemed her. The relationship she had with her dog solidified my like of her. She was rather fearless when it was needed. Her lack of mercy was a refreshing break that I enjoyed because it was absolutely warranted.  The one thing that always stood out to me was Shana Festa's ability to kill off a character in any way at any time. A lot of readers will enjoy this. It makes for a more edge of the seat, gripping read. But I think this is where reading predominately Young Adult literature has ruined me. I felt like the deaths sometimes overshadowed the rest of the story. The feeling of hope was missing and it stood out to me. But like I said, a lot of readers will enjoy the more realistic aspect.  Shana Festa definitely has something promising with the Time of Death series. With this debut, she has shown a strong handle of storytelling with a fluid grace. I will definitely be tuning in for the rest of this series.

"Wow, wow, WOW! This was the first book of Ruth Silver's that I've had the privilege of reading, and wow! I was blown away. The setting of Dead Girl Walking was so descriptive that I instantly felt enveloped by the world of Princess Ophelia Dacre.  The attention to detail didn't end with the setting. Each of the characters in Dead Girl Walking seemed so unique that I truly felt like I had met a new group of people. As the princess left behind her identity of Ophelia and submerses herself into a new life of Leila, the Grim Reaper, I felt like I was right there with her. The struggle with her new life and new responsibilities was showcased in a searingly honest way that allowed me to experience her resistance, too. For those of you who enjoy romance, there's definitely a budding connection in this book. But it isn't the focus of this story. I was so appreciative of that. It was enough romance to satiate my HEA-loving heart, but the focus of the book was on Leila and her journey.  I can promise you that this will not be my last read of Ruth Silver's works. Her talent is captivating, and I cannot wait for the next book in the Royal Reaper series to continue following Leila's adventures as a novice Grim Reaper.

"We all know I struggle with New Adult. I was skeptical about Priya in Heels. As soon as I saw that Tyler was a musician, I prepared myself for disappoint. But Ayesha Patel surprised me entirely and delivered a clever book that I adored!  Not only did the author deliver on witty characters who stood out on their own and a slow-building romance that I supported so easily, she gave me a glimpse into the culture of India. I devoured the details of Priya's heritage right along with the budding romance. Ayesha Patel was able to weave a book as rich in detail and beautiful as the culture she focused on.  The characters in Priya in Heels were so enjoyable and diverse. Priya's friends often had me laughing at their antics. As for Priya and Tyler, I was sold and swooning from the very start. The romance wasn't heavy handed or dark like I've sadly come to expect with New Adult. It was light and charming in the best of ways.  If you're a fan of Big Bang Theory or Penny Reid, then you'll find a new favorite with Priya in Heels. It's a smart romance filled to the brim with enjoyable characters and endearing love.**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ORJL9KH1DAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N04PCC4#wasThisHelpful","R9ORJL9KH1DAT","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shay West continues an action-packed adventure with Twisted Reflections. This book is a perfect follow-up to Dangerous Reflections. It picks up in the perfect spot and launches the reader right back into the complicated world of Alexis Davenport.  Even more so than the first book in the series, I could really tell how much Alex has evolved as a character. Shay West does a fantastic job with character development, and Twisted Reflections is a testament to that. A lot of new elements are introduced into her life, and the lapse between time traveling gives the reader a perfect chance to experience how Alex handles her extraordinary life.  The ending was very fitting, and I cannot wait to continue this amazing series. Shay West has outdone herself with Twisted Reflections, and I cannot wait to watch her grow even more as a writer.**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZ601D333N3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3A1NA6#wasThisHelpful","R1EZ601D333N3V","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll admit right from the beginning that mermaids aren't my thing. They always remind me of Ariel, and I'm not the biggest fan of Disney movies. (I've never really watched them. For shame.) But the way that Tiana Warner writes them, I'm a fan y'all! Gone are the fairy tales. I really enjoyed the angle that the author portrayed mermaids.  Meela was a strong main character. I feel like Tiana Warner was really able to capture her voice and make Meela seem so real and authentic. Even though she was fierce, Meela had her moments like the rest of us. What I didn't like was the drawn out back story. I'm always weary of information dumps, but I don't think that's what the author intended. I just think that less would have been more with such a drawn out glimpse into the past.  Tiana Warner is such a talented writer. I think with time, she'll only get better and better. While mermaids aren't my thing, I was still easily swept up into the world of Meela. If you're looking for Ariel, I don't think Ice Massacre is for you. But if you love a good and gritty fantasy, then you'll enjoy this epic tome.**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10TK8GQVCWBV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHCF4CM#wasThisHelpful","R10TK8GQVCWBV5","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The action packed into the pages of Rogue puts you on the edge of your seat! I was swept away by the dystopian style setting and action surrounding it. Chelsie Shock does not skimp on details and a solid back story which makes this a very immersive and enjoyable read.  At times, I felt the pace of the story drag. But overall, the dynamic of the world and how the characters related to each other spurred my interest and pushed me on. There is even a sprinkling of romance in there for those of you who love to swoon!  The premise of Rogue was definitely interesting. It wasn't too far fetched, and those books are the ones that terrify me! If I walk away from a book realizing that it could actually happen, you better believe I'll lose sleep over it. To me, that shows just how amazing the author is and Chelsie Shock and Rogue definitely fall into that category!**I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review with no compensation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GK9FZ67OVO78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCJRBDC#wasThisHelpful","R3GK9FZ67OVO78","A35C9GVZL2P0PW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35C9GVZL2P0PW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love triangles and cheating are my biggest turn-off in books. No One Needs to Know had a lot stacked against it before I even turned to the first page. But I was completely shocked and proven absolutely wrong. Love triangles can work whenever authors handle them with finesse like Amanda Grace did. I was absolutely blown away by this book. I loved it!  The book switches back and forth between Olivia and Zoey. I daresay if Liam's point of view had been used, I'd be less enthusiastic because of the circumstances. But I really grew close to the characters of Olivia and Zoey. I was skeptical about Olivia at first. It seemed like she was going to be a tangle of stereotypes, but like the rest of this book, she surprised me. It was really easy to root for Olivia and the relationship forming between her and Zoey.  No One Needs to Know was a pleasant surprise. I wasn't ready to let go whenever I finished this book. It's definitely one that I could see myself reading over and over again.

"Whoa. Sadie the Sadist is just as humorous as it is depraved and horrifying. I went from laughing uncontrollably to cringing and wishing for mind bleach while reading this one. It only took one sitting for me to finish this book, though.  There is plenty of gore to go around with Sadie the Sadist, but I didn't mind it. I was genuinely intrigued in seeing the world through Sadie's point of view as her sanity rapidly deteriorated before my eyes.

"Predator & Prey? Yes, please! This novella is very short, coming in around 30 pages. The punch that James D. Horton packs into those pages is phenomenal, though! This story came to a close way too early for me. I enjoyed every element of it, and I can't wait to spend more time with Lily and Wolf.  Lily is my kind of heroine. She radiated determination and grit. I wish more heroines were written like her! I really enjoyed Wolf, too. I chuckled at his ironic name. The relationship between the two really works out well. Intensity, of the good kind, is one of the adjectives I'd use for them!  Like I said, this book is on the shorter side. But I am still amazed at how quickly I was drawn into it.

"I think that I'm one of the few that love the idea of serials. I'm not ashamed to admit that I gravitate towards shorter books. If an author can pack a punch into a shorter story, then count me in. And that's exactly what A.J. Bennett has done with Hired Gun. It sets the tone as an amazing series opener. By the time I was finished, I was on the edge of my seat wanting more.  The way that the author introduces Thorne and his background definitely captured my interest from the start. I felt like he was introduced perfectly in relation to the story. Even though this was a serial, Bennett capitalized on really fleshing out her characters and making them believable and intriguing.  Hired Gun sets the stage for the next book in the series so well. The ending caught me off guard, because it ends so abruptly. But I feel like I can see where the next book is going.

"Eh. That really sums up my feelings about Feuds. It wasn't bad. It just didn't keep my attention or interest. A lot of the time I spent reading this, it felt like a chore. I'd glance over at the stack of books on my nightstand and wish that I could read something else. What I thought I was getting was going to be a dystopian with a beautiful cover. What I feel like I got was a tease of dystopian with a heavy helping of romance and a deceptively beautiful cover.  The potential was there. It was begging to crawl out from behind the insta-love. I think that's why this book was so eh for me. I'm really into dystopians. I will devour them like no other. And while there's a great premise to Feuds, it's never elaborated on. There's hardly any world building. There isn't even much character building. It's just a big ol' pot of 'here's some insta-love, so let's just ignore everything else'. Nothankyounope.  Sometimes I feel like Young Adult feels like it has to delve out insta-love. But the readers of Young Adult fiction aren't five year olds who watch Disney movies and expect a perfect Prince Charming and a happily ever after. Sure, a happily ever after is nice. But we don't need a perfect set of coincidences to get there. We want something that seems real. Something that we can relate to.  All in all, I won't be tuning in for another book in this series. As much as I want to know about the society that this story is set in and Davis' past, I just can't sit through more declarations of lust thinly veiled as love. The characters grated on my nerves because of the insta-love. There was simply nothing to redeem this book for me whenever I got to the end.

"Before I even begin this review, I want to dismiss all of the talk of The Fault in Our Stars and Zac and Mia being so alike. They're two very different stories. Yes, cancer is an integral part of the story in both of these books. But the similarities beyond that are so slim. Over and over, I heard that Zac and Mia was the new The Fault in Our Stars (mind you, Zac and Mia was written and published first). It gave me a lot of expectations going into reading Zac and Mia and I really wish I wouldn't have had those.  A.J. Betts deserves a standing ovation. She was able to take something very sensitive and build a beautiful story injected with humor and a wide range of emotions with Zac and Mia. At certain times, this book would be sobering for me as I sped through it. Other times, I'd find myself laughing at Zac's wit or his mother's antics. This is a book that's about more than cancer. Don't get me wrong: cancer is a huge part of it. But this book isn't wholly consumed with only being about cancer. There's so much depth to it.  I hate to admit it, but I really loathed the character of Mia. She deserved empathy from me, I know. She faced an impossible situation, and I don't think I would handle it much better. But I'm a sucker for characters being strong and overcoming obstacles. I felt like Mia just succumbed to her fate. The entire time I was reading this book, I wanted to throw her some boxing gloves and tell her to fight.  Zac, on the other hand, was the highlight of this book for me. It's rare that we get a male character in Young Adult that we get see the world through their eyes. With the way that A.J. Betts wrote Zac, I wish we had that privilege more. There was plenty of wit and reflection weaved throughout his story that perfectly balanced the matter at hand. I missed him whenever I finished reading this book. In fact, I missed his entire family.  If you're a fan of young adult who enjoys a good contemporary, then please pick up Zac and Mia. It has a hint of romance, but the story is so much more than that. Just do yourself a favor and go in with an open mind.

"On the plus side this vacuum does have plenty of power. On the negative side it's pretty big around and with the caster's on it stick out far enough to be a tripping hazard. If you have a small shop like I do floor space is a bit limited and this vacuum has a large foot print. There's one other problem with it. It doesn't come with a full set of the usual tools that normally comes with a shop vacuum. It only has two floor tools with the hose and two wand's. There's no round brush or a crevice tool. That little round brush head is the one I use the most to clean up the fine sawdust that gets on every thing when sanding a wood project. I couldn't find just a brush tool for it and I ended up buying a whole set of vacuum tools for it just to get the round one I needed.

"These are quite a bit smaller than what they say they are. I wear a size 11.5 to a size 12. When I got these they looked to be about a size 6. I couldn't even begin to get them on my feet.

"I bought a .22 Ruger semi-auto pistol way back in 1979 at the local Coast to Coast store. It was $125.00 and was the very first gun, and a hand gun at that, that I bought. I didn't get any kind of manual with it or anything showing &/or telling how to strip it down and clean it. So when I saw this book available on the very first gun I ever bought, I jumped on it! Well, I should've read more of the listing about the book and what it is about. It turns out that it's pretty much a history about the Ruger .22 Semi-Auto pistol and NOT anything about field stripping it, or taking it apart to clean it, or aftermarket parts to overhaul one of the older .22 models like the one I have.  Now this is an interesting book on the history of the Ruger .22 hand gun. But for a book explaining how to take apart and put back together one of the Ruger .22 Semi-Automatic Pistol's, this is pretty much a flop.

"I have a ""Smart Phone"" that I bought, new, a year ago at Radio Shack. So maybe the thing is to far outdated by now, I don't know. First of all this QUICKLINK OBD2 Wireless Tool did not come with much of anything for instructions on how to use it, or what to expect to get out of it.  First of all the thing did plug into my 2002 Nissan Pathfinder SE diagnostic plug under the dash with no problem. I did find out that I had to get an app for the Quicklink downloaded and installed in my cell phone. This information about needing the app was NOT in any of the information in the package that the QUICKLINK thing came in. Although there are instructions in the packet that the Quicklink came in but they are in at least 4, or more, different languages, other than English. There are some basic instructions in English but there's nothing telling how to use the Quicklink thing. I spent 2 days messing with the thing trying to get any information out of it about my Pathfinder. After several hours wasted over 2 days of trying to get this thing to work I finally gave it up as a bad idea.  Overall, I'm just happy that I have a very nice diagnostic code reader to check all available computer diagnostics in my 2002 Pathfinder, and this one ain't it. This is due to my habit of every time I buy a used car the first thing I do is get the Dealership Shop Manual for it, if possible. If that is not possible, then I get the best available shop manual for it and any diagnostic code reader that is available for it. I've found that in the long run, as in if I plan on keeping the vehicle for a long time, this is the best investment for it that I can make.  I really hate to say this, but, I suggest that you NOT invest your money on this thing. There are better and cheaper ways to get the self diagnostic codes from a vehicle without having to waste a lot of your hard earned cash on something like this QUICKLINK Wireless tool.  When you are having problems with a vehicle the first thing is, is it newer than 2000? They changed the way to get the cars self diagnostic codes on a lot of cars around 2000 to 2003. A lot of cars from the late 1980's to 1999 can do a self diagnostic that the garage or dealership will charge you around $100 or more for. All you need is the Chilton's book for your car and do a little trick with the ignition switch. Simply turn the key over to on, (not start like trying to start the car) then off, do it 3 times then turn the key to on, and leave it there. Now one of the dash red lights will start flashing. All you need to do is count the flashing. It will do the codes in sets. Like a code 23, it will blink 2 times, short pause, blink 3 times, then a little longer pause, then it will flash the next code. When its done it will give 5 flashes, then another 5 flashes. A code 55, that means that's all the codes. Doing this will tell you if you have a Oxygen Sensor that's burned out or not working right, it will tell you if the sensor in the exhaust is working right. This will tell you the same things that the computer at the auto shop will tell them when they hook your car up to it and charge you around a $100 for. Now this is where you need the Chilton's book on your car or you can look up the diagnostic codes online.  My father had a 1986 Chrysler Newyorker  and it had problems with the O2 sensors and the Speed sensor. The dealership wanted a couple hundred bucks just to look at it. I got the Chilton's book for $19 and the 3 sensors for it all for under $100 and it took me about 30 minutes to replace the sensors and it was running fine. The dealership would have charged well over $500 to do the same thing.  Any who, I messed with this QUICKLINK thing for several hours and I never did get it to work or give me any information, useful or otherwise. I have other vehicles but my 2002 Nissan Pathfinder is the only one I have that it will plug into. Maybe you will have better luck with it, but in my opinion it's a waste of money to buy it and a waste of time to try and use it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q8PGCIFFAH9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH1IFRA#wasThisHelpful","R1Q8PGCIFFAH9T","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ended up settling for this one after problems with 3 others from local store. Figured it would be alright since Westinghouse used to be a good quality brand. First thing the clock was a spazz. Set the date & time, turn it off and back on and not only would the time be wrong but the date would change. Every time I turned it on the date would be anywhere from a couple weeks off to several years ahead or behind. I figured Oh well, I have plenty of other clocks and it doesn't matter if it has one or not since the picture was good. And it did have a great picture! Just before I bought this one a friend had got a 42"" Vizio and tried talking me into getting one. But comparing his Vizio to this Westinghouse, this one had a far better picture. His Vizio was like watching TV through a screen door compared to this Westinghouse. I was pretty happy with it. It could have a couple more HDMI plugins on it and the speakers could be a little better. And for the price it should have WiFi built into it. But it wasn't too bad of a TV. Until a couple days ago.The drain for my kitchen sink got hopelessly clogged the other day and I was working on that while the TV was on. Then I noticed the sound quit. Turned around and looked at it and it was turned off. I thought. Now the thing wont turn on. I unplugged the power converter from the surge-protector power strip and plugged it in a different wall outlet. Still wouldn't turn on. Took the power converter out to my workshop and tested it with my electrical tester and it was putting out the voltage that the sticker on it says its supposed to put out. So there's nothing wrong with the power converter. I've emailed Westinghouse customer service, 3 days ago. I got a confirmation email from them that they received my email but haven't had any other contact from them. So tomorrow I'll start the game of Phone Tag with the automated phone system and see if I can talk to an actual person and find out if this thing has a reset button somewhere or a little fuse somewhere that can be replaced. Usually that's all is need when something like this just shuts off and wont turn on. Unfortunately I cant find the extended warranty I think I bought for it. By my receipt its 6 months past its Westinghouse warranty. Any which way I look at it I'm screwed out of $584 bucks I paid for it. 18 months of use just ain't worth that much. That comes out to just over $32 a month to have it. I ain't going to say what the cable company is screwing me for. But for $32 a month I may as well of had one of the rent to own things. Then it wouldn't cost me anything to replace it.So, if you already have one of these, good luck. Maybe you will have one that will last for years. I just wish I could have read some of these before I settled for this one because it sure didn't turn out to be worth what I paid for it. Specially since I had saved up my money for 2 years to buy the stupid thing. Being on SS disability what I paid for it is over half of months income for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QOTUXNZW1EO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SMX0ZS#wasThisHelpful","R1QOTUXNZW1EO7","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This printer was made to waste ink on purpose. Even if you seldom use it to conserve on ink, it was made to deliberately waste even more ink than usual before it runs each printing job. Here's the HP link to how it uses its ink;[...]That link is from the HP Customer Support where I posted the question of why it uses the photo black ink for plain text printing when it has a full X-Large Black cartridge for text printing. All I got was the run around from them and never did get a strait answer.This printer is made to waste ink before each printing job by doing a head cleaning cycle each time its used. I seldom needed something printed and I've never printed photo's with mine other than when I first set it up I did a test print of a photo. But yet after about 2 months it was out of photo black ink and color ink even though I hadn't printed anything in color. So I put a new set of cartridges in it and notice that the X-Large Black cartridge was still full. 2 months later and maybe half a dozen pages of black text printed, mostly shipping labels, and its out of color ink & photo black ink again. Oh, and it will not print anything when it thinks its out of photo black & color ink. Even with a full X-Large Black cartridge in it. For the few pages printed and the amount spent for ink to print them it cost about $5 to $10 a page. If I used it to print dollar bills that would work in a change machine I would be loosing money.This thing was deliberately designed to be a inkoholic and isn't very good at printing either. Stay away from this printer unless you want to waste a LOT of money for ink that you don't use. This has to be the worst printer I've ever seen or used.I hate to say it but, I've gone back to using an Epson printer. It's slower but at least I DON'T have to feed it a new full set of ink cartridges every couple of months when I haven't even used it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YQNRG28TLJS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Y38YCA#wasThisHelpful","R2YQNRG28TLJS4","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really cool case for anybody that is a hunter. Its easy to put on the phone and doesn't block any of the plugins or buttons, and all of them are still easy to get to. It even helps to protect the camera lens by being raised higher around it. I really like that part since I use the camera a lot and want to keep its lens protected as much as possible.The one thing that really sucks is the screen protector that came with it. As usual with these I got a bunch of air bubbles under it once I got it stuck on the screen. What sucks is how easy the screen protector is to scratch. After I got it stuck to the screen and when I was using the little card that came with it to work the bubbles out from under it, before I new it it had put several long deep scratches in the screen protector! Now that's not much of a screen protector when the little stiff paper card that they send with it to use to get the air bubbles out from under it actually ruins the screen protector by putting big scratches in it! It's brand new just installed and looks like its been with a kid dragging it around for a year. It's definitely the worst excuse for a screen protector I've ever tried. And I've tried several over the last couple of years.As for the little stylus that came with it, it doesn't work very well either. It's a couple of times bigger than what's really usable for this phone. And it takes a lot of pressure to get it to work. This is my first cell phone and I just got it a couple months ago. So there might be a setting somewhere to make the screen more sensitive to touch but if there is I cant find it. So this little stylus is pretty much useless.The little guitar pick looking thing is kinda cool. But don't use it on the screen protector. I think its only for opening the case to remove it from the phone. But then just about anything thin, flat, and stiff will work for that.Overall, the case is great looking and I love it. The extra's that come with it, not so hot. So for the case I give it 5 stars, I dropped a couple for the worthless extra's that came with it. Like that poor excuse of a screen protector. And usually those come in sets of 3 because you almost always ruin the first one just trying to get it on the screen strait. The ones I got for my Kindle all came in sets of 3 any who. They only give you one so if you don't get it on right the first time,,, too bad.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQAITP9OWI9HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCH3FNY#wasThisHelpful","RQAITP9OWI9HR","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just got a 16 foot boat with a 50 hp motor and needed something like this to put on the battery in it. So this came along just in time. I also have a 4x4 Scout I use just during hunting season and once I got the batter charged back up in it this has helped to keep it full charge. Now I need to get another one so I can have one in the boat and one on my Scout.It's real easy to use and even though its not a charger, just as an experiment I put it on the 12volt battery out of my Scout when it was real low on charge. After 24 hr's this had it back up to full charge giving it a good slow deep charge. It should be good for a couple of months since its only 2 years old and is a 60 month battery. After hunting season is over I'm going to take the battery out of my Scout and out of the boat and put them in my workshop so I can switch the charger back and forth every few days to keep a good charge in the batteries.I'm going to have to get another one now since it does so good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OCW644CSAHCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LX3AXQ#wasThisHelpful","R2OCW644CSAHCI","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My one favorite point on these is only one wire to tie the two together. That's if you are using them with the Bluetooth. I can now play all the music that I have stored on the chip in my phone without having to plug it into the speakers. Now I might have been doing something wrong but I needed to have the speakers plugged into each other to play in stereo. Ideally, with using the Bluetooth I shouldn't need any wires at all to play my music over both of them in stereo. But, maybe I was doing something wrong cuz I had to have a 6' jumper cord to plug into the typical speaker jack on each speaker to get both of them to play.  As for sound quality. About what I expected from such little bitty speakers. As in, not much for volume. What sound that they can put out isn't too bad. But they are weak on the amount of volume. Even with them plugged into my laptop for more power they still don't get the volume quite up there. And when it does get close they start getting into that static realm along with bad sound distortion. Now I'm a retired machinist with over 25 years running extremely noisy machines and I've gone target shooting with everything from .22cal pistol & rifles, 9mm pistol, .22Mag 20Gage over under, 7mmX57mm Mauser, and a Chine's SKS 7.62mmX39mm. Plus I shot competition on my local High School ROTC Rifle team for 4 years shooting in a indoor range. my point is that I have a lot of hearing loss. Especially up in the higher ranges. So just because I cant hear these speakers as well as I think I should, it doesn't mean that nobody else will either. But, the sound distortion that I could hear at max and close to max volume was still there in spite of my poor hearing or damaged hearing.  Overall, do I think that these speakers are really worth the $57.59 price tag they have put on them? NO. They have a little American Flag on the bottom of the packaging they came in and it says ""Designed and Engineered in the U.S.A.""Below that it says; Concu (or Conqu) Fabrique aux U.S.A.  MADE IN CHINA  FABRIQE EN CHINAThe upchuck of all that is that these little speakers were designed here in the states. But they gave the job of making them to the Chine's. We need the work right here in our own country so why was the manufacturing job given to China? I work many years in manufacturing and there is no excuse for not having items like this made by our own people. Lets try to keep American Made to mean something. Today it means about as much as something Made in Japan did back in the 1950's and Made in China does today.

"Just got my set of these today and tested it out. First thing the directions that are inside the lid tell you to calibrate it. Tells you how to turn it on for calibration then you are supposed to put a 500.0g weight on it. Well, I doubt there's very many people any where, and especially in the States that would happen to have something that weighs exactly 500.0g.  That's 500 grams. Or half a Kilo, right? So the only way I had to check it is with the old stoners trick of weighing a nickle. A nickle weighs a nickle, or just slightly under. So any time you need to check a set of light scales, put a nickle or 2 on it. Each one should be 5grams or a touch under. Like 4.9grams if its an old one about worn out or a lot of it worn off.  Any who, calibration of this may get to be a problem since it is set for auto calibration only with a 500 Gram benchmark weight. I have some test weights but the largest I have is only 25 grams. But it does pass the nickle test so as long as you don't want to use it for something very precise like I was going to use it. And that's to weight out gun powder for making my own reloads. For the price on it I should have figured it would be about this accurate.  For things like Weight Watchers, or as my dad and I called it when mom went to them ""Fat lookers"" these scales should replace the cheap spring type scale that my mother always had to use.  As for using this for mail, I don't know. Small packages it should work for those with no problem. Light weight letters, I doubt it. But still for the price, you cant beat these unless you need fractions of a gram to be accurately. For that I suggest a nice set of balance beams scales. I have a nice set from Harbor Freight. They are made of brass and supposed to be something of a novelty, but they work great. And are still a very cool novelty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZJYWFLRKD0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P1NYE8#wasThisHelpful","R2FZJYWFLRKD0M","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About the only good point on this is the light. It is fairly bright, not sure how long it will last but it is bright to start with.The cork screw is kinda cute, but too small to actually be considered usable. As for the rest of it, it got ruined by being over polished. The screw driver points are now useless since the sharp edges that they need have been polished off so that they are rounded over making them useless. What good is a flat screwdriver or Philips head driver that is already worn out? The knife blade is pretty dull but I like sharpening knives any who. About the only thing besides the light that is actually usable is the bottle opener. But even on it the hook part that you use on the rim of a bottle cap has been rounded off almost too much to still be usable.I was a precision machinist for over 20 yrs. and one of shops I worked in we made small hand tools. Who ever did the polishing on the pieces for this must have been stoned or on some drug of some sort cuz they have been rounded off way more than needed. Any who, I've seen small multi-tools that were a lot better and a few that were a lot worse. As it is the only thing practical and usable on this is the light.

"I've had several toaster ovens over the years. A few years back I got frustrated with trying to find one that actually worked like it was supposed to and made it a personal quest to find that perfect toaster/convection counter top oven. This one is in the smaller range that I didn't do much searching through since I was looking for one to take the place of my broken oven in my gas stove.As a basic, small toaster oven this is a pretty good one. It has a expanded back so that it can bake a small pizza up to 8"" dia. It has simple controls. One knob that you turn to set the temp that you want and a second knob to set the timer. That's it. No digital temp controls, no multiple functions to select one from. It preheats in just a minute or two so it's quick and easy to use and doesn't use a lot of electricity.My Oster Convection Toaster Oven is about twice the size of this one and is the one that I chose after test driving 7 or 8 different ones 2 or 3 years ago. There are a few things that this smaller one is more suitable to use instead of the bigger one so the two complement each other. And now I hardly use my microwave for anything other than re heating my cup of coffee.Just one thing to remember. This is a toaster OVEN. So don't expect it to toast your Bagels by just sticking them in it, turning it on to Toast, and go off to another room doing something else and expect your Bagels to toast and NOT get BURNED. That's why a normal toaster pops the toast up after its finished the toast cycle. So you have to watch this as it toasts what ever it is that you are toasting. So that you can remove it as soon as it is toasted to that perfect color that you like. I just mention this because in my research of toaster ovens I found that several people had wrote negative reviews on several toaster ovens because they almost burned their kitchen down when they went off doing something else after putting their Bagels in it to toast them. And of course, since they were not there to remove them when they were done, after the toaster oven turned off the Bagels continued to sit in the hot oven and started to burn. So they blamed the toaster oven instead of themselves for not paying attention to it. I'm pretty sure that in the directions on these things that it tells you in one way or another, do not leave it unattended.One other thing for those that are concerned about it. This one does have a grounded plugin on it. The cord is nice and heavy, if a little on the short side. Most of the toaster ovens that I've tried in the last several years have the polarized plugin. So if you have a older home that doesn't have grounded outlets in the kitchen you might want to look for another one or order a plugin adapter while you are ordering this.So if you are looking for a basic, simple, small toaster oven, this will probably fill that need. If you are looking for something to actually replace using your big oven in your stove for most of those smaller baking jobs then you probably wouldn't be happy with this. For that I would suggest the;Oster TSSTTVMNDG Digital Large Capacity Toaster Oven, Black/Polished Stainless AccentsAfter I did my research on these a few years ago that was the one I decided was the keeper and I'm still happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U36EAA0P8PO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZSZYTO#wasThisHelpful","R2U36EAA0P8PO5","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first it looks like a good idea. In practice it ain't so great. Cheap plastic fittings on the ends that leaked from the first time I tried to use it. It's pointless to try to use for watering your yard since it is only at its full length when it has pressure in it.

"This is a nice cute little set of Mortars & Pestles. There's just one thing about these that I really don't like. And that is the rough surface on the ends of the Pestles and on the inside bottom of the of the Mortars. They are very rough and feeling them is like dragging my fingernails across a really rough chalk board. To use one and actually rub the end of the pestle across the bottom of the Mortar just sets my nerves on fire and makes them try to go crawling off somewhere on their own. Just thinking about using one of these gives me what me mum would call a bad case of the shidders. I got out my air powered high speed angle grinder and used a special sanding disc made for extremely hard metals that I figured would work on ceramics and used it to smooth down that rough surface on them. I got most of the worst of it smoothed down a little bit but just lightly rubbing the end of the pestle in the bottom of the mortar is still like dragging my fingernails across a genuine slate chalk board. Gives me the shidders just thinking about it! I cant even pick one of them up now without my skin wanting to crawl off someplace and hide. ;-)So if fingernails dragged across a chalk board sets your nerves crawling you probably wouldn't like trying to use one of these. Now if things like that don't bother you then you would probably like this set. Now if I can get the bottom inside the Mortar smoothed down a little more then I'll be able to use them, I hope.The rough finish on the inside bottom of the Mortar and on the end of the Pestle is the reason that I gave these a 3 star rating. I suppose they made them this way to help them be able to crush things to a powder easier. Any who, if the fingernails on a chalk board thing bothers you, you might want to try a set of glass ones instead of the ceramic. I wish I had ordered the glass one instead too. If I cant get at least one set of these polished down and get rid of the rough then I'm ordering a glass one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9JLRFD7NKYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BI4GII#wasThisHelpful","R1H9JLRFD7NKYE","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got mine day before yesterday and have only had a little time to try it but that's all I needed to see just how much this thing can suck up! It has way more, several times more sucking power than my 1.5hp ShopVac and makes only a fraction of the noise the old shop vac does. Besides its super sucking power I cant believe how quiet it is! I was hoping to find one that wasn't as noisy as my old shop vac but have a lot more suction power and this is it. The first time I turned this on I had my TV on at normal volume and I expected not to be able to hear anything else but the vacuum. Surprise! I could still hear the TV and understand what they were saying without any problem at all!As for sucking power, this thing is like, WOW!

Add to that a bad lower back and a neck injury that makes doing anything quite painful. So needless to say, but I will any who, my place is a little more than say,, a disaster area. It would just about take a tornado to clean it up. With that in mind this vac is just what I needed. It's light weight and has such sucking power I only have to go across an area a couple of times for it to suck up rocks, sand, dirt, goat heads, stickers, and everything else that has built up over the years. My old shop vac couldn't suck up the same stuff this one did in a minute, even if I run my old one across the same area all day.My only complaint about this one is the wands that came with it. They are so flimsy! Granted, they are light weight, but they are also very crooked. When I stuck them together with the bow in each one going the opposite of the other it almost looks like a snake crawling across the floor. With the bow in each one turned the same way it makes a nice rainbow shape. Maybe not a complete rainbow, but enough to be very notice able. It would really  help if they had a little larger inside diameter and a little thicker wall so that there was more to them. Also if they had a larger ID it wouldn't restrict the suction power like the ones it has does. But, other shop vac tubes that are stronger, longer, and don't have a bow in them, will fit and work with it's hose.I have a pretty good upright vac but the beater bar in the head of it likes to catch on a string in the carpet and unravel it wrapping it around the bar in the process. It does pretty good in large open area's, which I don't have cuz of too much stuff. And even though it has a hose and attachments, when using the hose the beater head keeps running and it makes all sorts of noise.  I'm so glad that I decided to give this one a try! It has so much sucking power and is so quiet I can hardly believe it. I've never in my life seen or used such a strong vacuum that is so quiet! It probably even has enough suction power to run one of those small roller brush heads that work off of the air flow. Even if it doesn't it still has enough suck power to pull up all but the deepest dirt in the carpet. I highly recommend this vacuum for anybody looking for a new one. You might want to pick up a set of stronger & longer wands or tubes for the hose but it still does pretty good with the ones that come with it. This has to be the best vacuum anywhere for under $100. Besides, if you don't like it you can always send it back. But I'd bet that after you try it you wouldn't let anybody take it away from you for anything.So if you are looking for a good deal on a great vacuum you should give this one a shot. I bet you will be very happy with it.There's one other little thing and that's the bags for it. They are a bit expensive and a little hard to find other than on Amazon. So after using the one that came with it I'm going to try one of the blue wrap around paper filters that I use with my old shop vac. It doesn't have the plastic ring to hold it on but a good sized rubber band or small bungee cord should hold it on over the paper filter inside it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G6NNCRIVMJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0023EY002#wasThisHelpful","R2G6NNCRIVMJ2","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a bad back for over 30 years and I've almost always needed something behind my lower back when driving. I recently got a Nissan Pathfinder that has an adjustable lumbar support built into the seats back but its about 2 to 3 inches too high for me and for where I need the support. I was hoping that this would be just right for what I need but its not quite right. It's too firm and too thick to really be comfortable. Now if it had an air bladder in it so that it could be inflated making it larger and firmer or soft and small would make it a lot better and work for more people. Depending on what kind and how much support you need for you lower back you might be able to use this.The best part about it is you can belt it around yourself or around the back of your seat or chair to help keep it in place.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVGZKID9J3ZDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BZC43G4#wasThisHelpful","RVGZKID9J3ZDC","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This worked Ok with my Kindle Fire, but I'm not really crazy about it. It definitely isn't worth close to $20 for it. If I was to buy this in a store I wouldn't pay more than a buck for it.Being as short as it is makes it a bit odd and harder to use than the usual pen is. Also the end is too big around. I was hoping that it would make it easier than my big fat fingers are to use the touch keyboard on my Kindle. But the big end on it and short length make it hard for me to touch the right letters with it. Now if the tip was about 1/4 of it's size or smaller, about the size of the head of a wooden kitchen match, and tapered down to it like a normal pen is, and a bit longer, then I would probably like it a lot more since this would make it easier to use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R180A6ODEML70J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGAEOW2#wasThisHelpful","R180A6ODEML70J","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This dropped right in my 1992 Dodge Dakota with the 3.9 V6. It saved me a little over $20 for the cheapest one I could find in the parts stores, which was this same radiator at Auto Zone. All the other parts stores wanted at least over $60 to $100 more for the same part. I'm happy with it and it was easy to install.

"This is now my favorite shirt! It's very comfortable and made of light weight t-shirt material. It's a true Triple Extra Large with a long enough tail and fits my 6'-4"", 250 pound body just right. The first time I wore it in public I got several comments on it from people that liked it. As well as several disgusted looks from those prudes that are against the use of Pot for any reason. Of the two I think I got at least double the complements from people that liked it over the few that obviously didn't.Some of the shirt colors don't show the pot leaf very well. I got the light gray one and it shows the leaf nice and clear. The black, charcoal, and green ones the leaf doesn't show up very clear at all.Overall, this has now became my favorite shirt and should last for a couple years if I take care of it.

"This is a really cool hat! The printing on it has been well done and should stay there for many years. My only problem with it is its a bit undersized. If you really need a XL then don't bother with this one. It might be slightly bigger than just a large, but it's not close enough to X-Large. It might stretch after wearing it long enough but the trick is putting up with it being too tight until it starts to stretch out.

"This looked like a pretty neat do-dad to speed load my clips for my Ruger pistol. I have a couple of the original 9 shot clips for it. One that came with it and an extra I bought for it and I also have a couple of 10 shot clips made by Ruger I bought later. The 9 shot clips couldn't load at all because they couldn't be pushed in far enough. The ten shot clips went in far enough but still one of them wouldn't load at all and the other one would only take one or two rounds at a time and I had to shake it and pump the clip in and out for each round that made it into the clip. And then it still wouldn't fully load the clip.This thing may work with other clips but it wouldn't work with mine. So in my opinion its just another gimmick to take your money from you. If you try it, be prepared to send it back. Mine went back the same day that I got it. At least it didn't cost me anything to try it out. Since it did sorta work with one of the 4 clips I have and it might work great with somebody elses clips, I gave it 2 stars instead of just one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DFVYA45LIRJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YF931Y#wasThisHelpful","R1DFVYA45LIRJP","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this because I normally like the smell of apple cinnamon because it makes me remember what it was like when my mom used to bake apple pies. This is nothing like that. One of the bottles sitting by itself behind my flat screen TV was just about right. I tried to find just a 2 pack of the night lights for these and ended up only being able to get 6 of them just so I could try one of these out.So I put one of the Apple Cinnamon oil scent in one of the nightlight things and plugged it in an outlet in my front room. It wasn't long before the smell was overpowering and had my sinuses clogged up so bad I couldn't breath. I had to take the thing out of the front room and put it in my spare room I use for storage at the far end of my trailer. Even with it closed up back there the smell of it was way too strong. I've turn the little adjustment thing down as low as it will go then covered the top of the hole with a piece of tape then plugged it in the outlet above my washer & dryer. That just about reduced its output of the smell to the point I can almost stand it. But its still bothering my sinuses and I cant take the over powering smell of it.I don't know who had the idea for this scent and who it was that came up with it but they sure got something wrong with it. Normally my sinuses are not that sensitive but this stuff really set them off. As much as a hate to waste stuff, unless I can find somebody that likes these and I can give these to them then they are going in the trash because I just cant take the burning and constant running of my sinuses. From now on I'm going to stick to the Fabreez stuff cuz this Air Wick stuff is just way too strong.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JPDI5INVZ6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VAGXC6#wasThisHelpful","R2JPDI5INVZ6S","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a ""Mr. Coffee BVMC-EL1 Cafe Latte"" maker the fall of 2011 and had a lot of fun making the different drinks. But it wasn't near as nice as this one is. For making the milk frothy it used a funky whisk like thing run by a little motor in the lid for the little coffee pot. It worked great, for a while. But the little motor that made the milk foamy wasn't big enough or powerful enough to last very long. Using it 2 or 3 times a day it quit working after only 3 months. With the way this one, the ""Mr. Coffee BVMC-ECMP1000 Caf√© Barista Espresso Maker"" does the milk it should last for a long time.I also like the way I don't have to worry about how much water to put in the tank or how much milk to put in its little tank either. The machine automatically uses the same amount every time. And if I want a little more water to my Latte or Cappuccino I only need to press the Espresso button and it will give it another shot of hot water.On the little tank for the milk there's a little knob that you use to select Latte on one side or Cappuccino on the other. With it set to Latte the milk comes out nice and hot and lightly foamed. On Cappuccino the milk is frothier or more aerated than on Latte. You can adjust just how foamy or frothy you want your milk, from lightly foamy (Latte setting) to very foamy with lots of bubbles (Cappuccino setting) just by where you set the knob. It's just like turning the volume knob on a radio.For the amounts that it brews, a Cappuccino single serving is a little over Ω cup (150ML). A double serving is a little under a full cup (225ML).A single serving Latte is about 1 full cup, 8 oz. (225ML) A double Latte is 1 ¬Ω cups (350ML).An Espresso single serving is between ¬º and a 1/3 of a cup (75ML). A double serving is a little under ¬Ω cup (125ML).So when brewing any one of the selections a double serving is actually 1 ¬Ω servings instead of 2 full servings.There is one thing that might become a problem with it. And that is the little filter cups. As a retired machinist and seeing how these were made I can see a problem with them getting clogged up with fine debris &/or mineral build up from the water. They have a double bottom in them with several tiny holes smaller than a needle in the inside piece. There is a small gap between the part with the holes on the inside and the outer piece that has a single hole in the middle that's a little bigger than the ones on the inside. The only way for water to pass through it is by being under pressure. And as small as the holes are it won't take much to clog them. And when enough minerals from the water build up in the tiny holes and between the bottom pieces they will have to be replaced. I think it will be just like the holes in a shower head getting clogged up with minerals. Except the holes in a shower head are several times larger than the size of the tiny holes in these filter cups. I'm only using water that has been run through one of the Brita water pictures with the replaceable filter to help prevent the buildup. If only bottled water is used in it that might help prevent buildup in them too.I think it's a bit over priced. $200 for a machine to make coffee a cup at a time is a pretty high price for something made mostly of plastic. And of course, it is made in China. So it probably cost about $2 to manufacture it. So personally I'm not very comfortable with recommending buying this one at this price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M55PHNLZO3L5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007K9OIMU#wasThisHelpful","R2M55PHNLZO3L5","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It does what its supposed to do and that's to keep people from snooping and seeing what's on your screen. Unless they want to get right up and look over your shoulder. I wasn't as concerned about privacy as getting rid of the glare on the screen and protecting the screen. But as some of the other reviewers have pointed out the loss of details in the images on the screen aren't really worth the trade off.

"I did have the glare reducing screen protector on my Kindle first. It was alright for reading but for watching video clips or movies it was like watching TV with finger prints all over my glasses. I didn't really realize the difference until I took it off and tried one of these. It's not all that difficult to get these on if you do all the prep and are very careful. Make sure the screen is as clean as you can get it. I used a microfiber cloth to polish the screen and clean all the surface of my Kindle. Then laid it on a clean microfiber cloth while putting the film on the screen. First made sure that my hands were as clean and oil free as I could. Take the time to get it lined up and work the bubbles out as you go. One of the small microfiber cloths around a credit card and use the edge of the card works pretty good. Its worth the effort to protect the screen on it and once you get it on the screen right you can hardly tell its there.

"What I got wasn't quite what I expected. From what I've read in a couple reviews on it I'm not the only one a little disappointed in it. I needed something for a Hoya plant for indoors so I really didn't need something with a hole in bottom of it. As for the liner the recycled paper its made of doesn't look like it would last very long. So for a few touch ups I gave it a couple coats of spray Polyurethane on the inside and a couple on the outside with brown stain in it. Then I used about half a tube of Plumbers Goop to stick the plastic lid from a can of Folgers Coffee upside down over the hole in the bottom. Used most of a spray can of gloss Polyurethane on the outside to finish it off and it looks pretty nice. It's probably not enough to make it waterproof but should be enough to keep it from falling apart. I let it sit outside for 3 days to let the Polyurethane cure out before I put my Hoya start in it. It looks great and I really hope the Hoya plant, or actually its a vine, takes off and grows. My mother had one and it was over 40 years old with at least 150 feet of vine and after she passed away my sister destroyed it. I managed to salvage 3 leaves from the garbage and got them to grow some roots in a glass of water. Now I hope they will take off and grow now that I have them in some dirt.As for the hanging wire frame for the pot it looks pretty good. It looks like its been dipped in some sort of rubber or plastic coating to keep it from rusting. The hanging chains look like they have also been powder coated or enameled to keep them from rusting.If you don't like the appearance of the pot and want to take the time there's a few things you could have some fun doing to it to help it last longer. Give it a couple coats of clear acrylic or Polyurethane or something like that and brushed on would probably work better than the spray I used. Then get artistic with some paints or if you got kids let them have at it with some paints and you could end up with something nice and unusual for your flowers on your patio, deck, or wherever. It wont only make it look a lot better it should help make it last a lot longer. If this one last for a while I think I'll do just that. Get a few more and see what I can come up with. They are cheap enough so if they don't last its no big deal. And like somebody else said, if the paper pots fall apart I can find some plastic ones or clay ones or something else to use in them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19EXQ4K3CAEEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXY0QR4#wasThisHelpful","R19EXQ4K3CAEEX","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years for a cold pack or heat pack I've just taken a folded up hand towel, soaked it full of water and put it in a big Ziploc baggie. Then either put it in the freezer for a cold pack or microwave it for a heat pack. This has always worked but usually have to wrap another towel around it and then the heat pack usually leaks. But for cheap and easy its hard to beat.Now after getting tired of frozen plastic & getting burned by hot plastic this is a very nice alternative. This works best as a heat pack. I have a fairly high power microwave and it only takes a minute and a half to two minutes to get this plenty hot. Depending on your microwave I would suggest starting with one minute and see how hot that gets it. Then depending on how hot you got it it's hard to say how long it will stay hot. Of course if you fold a good hand towel around it a few times it will stay hot longer. As for a cold pack it didn't really work all that well. I left it in the freezer for a couple of days so it was as cold as it was ever going to get. I used it folded in half then a towel around it to place it on a infected tooth. Now that was one long weekend waiting to get to my dentist! Alternating between this and a frozen wet towel in a ziploc baggie got me through it till I made it to my dentist. Of the two uses for this, hot or cold, I would have to say it works better as a hot pack. Calling it a ""Whole Body Wrap"" is really misleading. The picture on the box showing it laying across the back of a woman is also a bit deceptive. She must be a rather small woman for it to look so big laying on her. It's actually about 6.5"" wide and about 22"" long. It's just the right size to lay across the small of my back or on the back of my neck and shoulders. In my opinion I don't think its really worth the original price of $20 but the reduced price of $12.72 is about right for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBXZQ2HROXMOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098QAVEM#wasThisHelpful","RBXZQ2HROXMOF","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one sweet little Bit Driver! The cylinder that holds the bits works just like the revolving cylinder in a hand gun works. It also has 2 built in lights. 3 if you count the one on top that points forward or backwards to show which direction the switch is set for. It has a little spot light that points at the screw you want to take out or where you want to put a screw. It has another light inside the cylinder that holds 12 driver bits, so you can see which one you want to select. To select the bit driver you want all you do is pull the big sliding switch on top back towards yourself. This turns the light on inside of it and retracts the bit that was in use, if there was one,(The light turns off automatically after a few seconds). Then just turn the cylinder till you see the bit driver you want in the little magnifying window on top. Then just slide the big selector switch forward and it loads the bit into the front of the driver. When a bit driver gets too worn out to use any more you just load it like your going to use it, then pull it out of the front of the driver. Some of the small ones are hard to get hold of so you might need a pair of pliers to pull it out. Then just stick a new one in the end of the driver, then pull the selector switch back to load it in the cylinder. The only thing I don't like about mine is the revers/forward switch just above the trigger slides back and forth too easy. With just the slightest touch it changes the direction the driver turns. It needs a spring notch or something to click it into place so it stays there. One thing that's kinda funny is you can use one of the mini USB plugins to plug into the bottom of the handle of it and the other into the USB on your computer to recharge the battery in it! Or if you have an adapter with a USB plugin to stick in the cigarette lighter in your car or truck you can use it to recharge this bit driver. The mini USB plugin for my TomTom GPS fits it perfect to plug it into the cigarette lighter to recharge it. It does come with a wall adapter to recharge it with a normal power outlet.As for using it. It does have a surprising amount of torque for its size. Bit changes are quick and easy. I'm not sure how long it can be used before it needs recharged. But for its size, its the perfect thing to replace the loose screwdrivers in the kitchen junk drawer. As well as being handy in the workshop.

"This little jewel is in my workshop on my workbench between my Tormek Tool Grinder and Dewalt Scroll Saw. For having only one little LED bulb in it, it's very bright. With the long flex neck on it it's perfect for using my Dewalt Scroll Saw. And with the single bulb it doesn't have that weird multiple shadow effect that the LED lights with several small bulbs in them do. The light from it is also perfect for doing those small detail bench jobs that are hard to see with the overhead florescence lights. One other thing nice about it is no heat. A regular light bulb this bright would put out some heat. Enough that it could burn you if you touched it in the wrong place.Even though I put mine to use out in my workshop it would do just as well and be just as nice as a light on a desk top. Or even as a light on your night stand next to your bed. With the easy to find button to turn it on and off and being bright enough to read by it would make a nice bedside light as well. What ever use you might need a small but bright lamp for this one should fill that need.

"I think they put this in the split bottle with 2 liquids that mix together when you use it just for a advertising and sales gimmick. It looks like they were trying to copy the liquid drain cleaner that's in a 2 liquid bottle too. As for a stain remover I guess it works about the same as their old single liquid does. It cleaned my greasy jeans I had on when I was helping a friend put a new clutch in his Dodge Dakota pickup. I used it on one leg and used my own mix I made by putting some liquid Tide & water in a spray bottle. Mixed it with about enough Tide for 2 large loads to about a quart of water. Used that on the other leg of my greasy jeans. After they were washed and dried I couldn't tell which leg I used the Resolve on from the one with my home made stain remover. So personally I don't see any reason for the extra expense to use this on my laundry. Besides that trying to get the same amount out of each side of the bottle is almost impossible. So for me for anything that my own mix doesn't work good enough on I'll just use the single liquid stain remover that's a lot easier to use and works just as well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OYOH3PWHB08D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006KXSE9K#wasThisHelpful","R3OYOH3PWHB08D","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time I saw this I had been looking for a good scroll saw for a couple of months. This looked like just the thing I had been looking for and jumped on it. Then I found the one major flaw they made when they designed it. And that is it will only take a specially made blade with pins. The blades are only 4"" inches long with only 3"" of teeth on them, and this is the only saw that they will fit. Plus they only have 4 types of blades. There are 3 TPI sizes, course, medium, and fine, and a course tooth one that the ends are turned 90 degrees so you can change your direction of cut. And to top that off, they cost several times as much as the normal pin end blades do. I have no idea why they would make such a nice scroll saw that can be used free hand or clamped to a table top and do so much more than the usual bench top scroll saw, and then cripple it by making it so that it can only use these short, special, and very expensive blades. Because of that it is now sitting in my shop on my top junk shelf with my other failed tools. If they make the blades cheaper, in price not quality, and add a few more TPI choices then I'll get it down and get some use out of it. Until then its just another dust collector.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XTC3C19A4YLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AFELU6O#wasThisHelpful","R2XTC3C19A4YLY","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I figured for the price of this that it would have wimpy sound with little volume. But for under ten bucks it would at least make a nice case for my MP3 Player. Since it takes 2 AA Batteries that's no big deal when I have several sets of the AA rechargeable batteries for my digital camera's.After I put a pair of fresh charged AA's in it and plugged my new little SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip 4GB MP3 Player (Blue) into it I played Iron Butterfly In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (long version) just to test its full range of sound. When I heard what came out of this little thing I couldn't believe it! The little thing sounded absolutely fantastic! Even with the little speakers only a couple inches apart it still managed to give that left to right to left effect to the sound of the drum solo with all the deep bass that goes with it too. The long organ solo with all its highs was as close to perfect as it could be. The experiment of testing it with In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida was just flat Jaw dropping! It sounded so good I just had to do it again, several times.Now because of its size and only being powered by a couple AA batteries it doesn't have a lot of window rattling volume that vibrates your teeth, makes pictures fall off the wall, dogs howl, babies cry, and cats run for cover. But it has way more volume than the speakers in my Dell 17"" Studio laptop, more volume and far better sound than what comes out of my Kindle Fire, far better than what I get from the Logitech S-150 USB powered speakers I have connected to my laptop. And those are way bigger and cost about 3 times as much as these little SmashBox Speakers do. I've tried several small speakers just for my laptop and not a single one of them comes close to the quality and quantity of sound that I get out of this thing for my MP3 player.I haven't tried any of the other small portable speakers for my SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip 4GB MP3 Player (Blue). One reason is the price of them. Most are at least twenty bucks or more. But mainly because I would have to buy 2 of them and then get the stereo splitter so I could have stereo sound.And look at this little SmashBox. For its small size you still get great sound, in stereo, and a nice padded case that will hold just about any size music player. Now if you are lugging around something like a big iPad or the 7"" or bigger Kindle Fire, or any of the other electronic pads just for listening to your music then you need to spend $35 or so and get a SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip 4GB MP3 Player (Blue) or any of the other cheap music players out there. The little Clip Zip even takes the micro SD card and I have my entire 17GB music collection on mine. And this little SmashBox speaker thing has room inside it for my Clip Zip, earbuds for when I want to listen to my music by myself and NOT listen to everybody around me, and the power cord to recharge my Clip Zip and still have room for a extra pair of AA rechargeable batteries to power the speakers.I highly recommend this for anybody that would like stereo speakers for their MP3 player and on a budget. Especially if you already have some AA rechargeable batteries. If you don't have some already they are well worth the investment for when you get a digital camera. When you get a digital camera then the rechargeable batteries are a necessity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C7GUCTQIBXF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002QPQNLC#wasThisHelpful","R3C7GUCTQIBXF3","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Other than being a Doctor Who shirt with the Tardis on it the main reason I bought this was that one word, ""Glowing"". Now any other shirt or item with a picture on it like this and it says ""something name of item ""Glowing"" something name of item. I take it to mean that something is supposed to ""Glow"" in the dark. As in; Doctor Who ""Glowing"" Angels have the Phone Box,,, I take it to mean that something about it, most likely the Angels, are Glowing. As in Glowing in the dark. Since for something to be ""Glowing"" requires the item to be in the dark so that it can be seen, ""Glowing"".For those of you that this was too complicated. It says ""Doctor Who Glowing Angels Have The Phone Box"" I assumed that meant at least the Angels to possibly all the printing on the shirt would Glow in the dark. I have other T-shirts that glow in the dark and I even have a set of bed sheets with comets and stars on them that glow in the dark. So I expected at least some part of this shirt to glow in the dark. I don't know if anybody else's shirt glows in the dark but the one that I got does NOT glow in the dark. Now, having white on black it would seem to ""Glow"" under a black light. but it doesn't say anything about it being a black light shirt or needing a black light for it to Glow.Any who, it is a pretty nice shirt. The printing on it, (or silk screening if that's the way it was done) seems to have been well done and has pretty good detail. The tag for who made the shirt that was sewn into the back of the neck of the shirt has been cut out. So I cant tell who actually made it.I was going to give it only 1 or 2 stars because it says that its ""Glowing"" when it does not glow. But, since it is still a pretty nice shirt I'm giving it a 3 star rating. Now if it did NOT have that word ""Glowing"" in its listing I would have gave it 5 stars. This is the second shirt that I have bought like this. I ordered them both at the same time, both of them said that they were ""Glowing"" shirts when neither one of them glow. It would take a black light or setting them on fire to make them actually glow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IGFJXG4T7XCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085CBUR2#wasThisHelpful","R2IGFJXG4T7XCA","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to the measuring instructions to find what size you need I needed a large. It says if the circumference of your head is between 23 1/4"" to 24"" inches you need a large. and 24 1/4"" to 25"" inches you need a XL. OK, my head measures 23 3/4"" inches so this helmet should fit me. It doesn't. First, it sits up too high like it has about an inch too much padding in the top but it has hardly anything for padding in the top. The worst fit is the width at the front of me ears. It's so tight, its very painfully tight on the joint of my jaws. It puts so much pressure in the area in front of my ears and down to my lower jaw its too painful to leave it on for any length of time. It was bad enough that it gave me a bad headache and there is no way that I would be able to leave it on for more than half a minute, and I doubt I could stand it for that long. It felt like I had my head in one of those mid-evil torture devices like a big bench vice that they keep screwing down tighter and tighter till it crushes your head like a melon or giant walnut.As for its functions. The full face flip up is really nice and the built in vents for air intake in the front and out flow in the back should help keep your head cooler when riding in the summer time. I've always wanted a helmet like this one and it really bums me out that its so far undersize. I've thought about getting something like a soccer ball that I can let the air out of, stick it in the helmet and use my air compressor to pump it up and force it out a little wider where its so tight on my jaws and ears. Maybe if I leave it like that long enough it will reshape it enough that I can use it.What it comes down to is ordering a helmet online and expecting it to fit you properly is like trying to order a pair of shoes online. Both of those items are something that you really need to be able to try on for fit and comfort before you buy them. And that's something that just cant be done when ordering those items online. There are many things that can be ordered online without having that personal touch to check for size, feel, and fit. But then there are many things that you just cant get the right fit ordering it from a picture online. This is one of them.Overall I can recommend this helmet, if you buy it from a store where you can try on several of them and find the one that fits you comfortably. However, I cant recommend ordering one this way online. Chances are you will not get one that fits you properly &/or comfortably.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SIC870EVMP1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00976H1VY#wasThisHelpful","R2SIC870EVMP1K","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, maybe I'm a bit thick and don't get the joke. But, just where's the ""Glowing""? That one word was the main reason that I bought this shirt. Now I'm very bummed out since there isn't anything on, in, or about this shirt that is ""Glowing"". Now maybe ""Glowing"" means something else over yonder on the other side of the big pond. Over here, it generally means that something, in this case the Tardis Union Jack on the shirt, is suppose to ""Glow"" as in ""Glow in the dark"".So if you are thinking about buying this shirt thinking that the word ""Glowing"" means that it will glow in the dark, forget it. Because there isn't anything about, on, or in this shirt that glows. In the dark or anywhere else. Except maybe under a black light. But I don't have one so I don't know if it does or not.Now if they take that word ""Glowing"" out of the listing then I'll change my rating from one star to five.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R8K67KZHK4OT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B01HAX8#wasThisHelpful","R3R8K67KZHK4OT","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one cool looking Thermometer & conversation piece to put on my display shelves in the front room. I first saw one of these several years ago. I cant remember where it was and even though I really wanted to get one they were way too expensive. I stumbled across this one while looking for something else and couldn't believe the price so I just had to get one. It is pretty accurate but, it has a kinda wide range between the colored balls. It gives you the temperature in 4 degree F increments instead of the 2 degrees F increments that a regular thermometer does. It may have wider increments than a conventional thermometer but since the balls are so big once you can remember how many are floating is what temperature you can tell what it is at a glance. It's pretty simple really. The fewer balls floating in it the warmer it is, the more balls floating the colder it is.Now I have to get one of the big ones for myself and a few of them this size for gifts for those that are hard to shop for.UPDATE DAY LATER;  Just smack a me up side me head. Something has been bugging me about the number of glass balls inside this thing ever since I took mine out of the box. It only has 7 glass balls in it but the one in the photo has 10! What's the deal? You show a picture of one with 10 glass balls in it then in the slightly smaller than usual print you list;  *Glass sphere's inside thermometer rise or fall depending on temperatures  *7 colored spheres  *Gold finish on ∞F/¬∞C tags attached to liquid-filled spheres  *Design based on Galileo's original thermometerA lot of people would consider that deceptive advertising. OK, some listings use a ""STOCK"" photo of the item that might not look exactly like what you will get. But they usually tell you this in the listing. But displaying a photo of one with ten glass balls in it when you are sending ones with only seven is awful close to fraud.I started to give this a full 5 stars. But because of the difference between it and the photo in the listing I'm only giving it 2. If you change the photo and let me know, then I'll change my rating. After looking at several of the other listings one of these with 10 glass balls in it is at least 17"" inches tall and over $20. The other ones I seen that are around 11"" or 12"" tall only have 5 glass balls in them but still cost more than this one does. So even though its being deceptive with a picture of one with 10 in it when the one they send only has 7, at $10.42 it's still the best deal out of the ones I've seen that are available. I will assume that you got the photo's mixed up and accidentally used one for a 17"" tall one with 10 balls in it instead of a 12"" with seven balls in it.Any who, in spite of the possible deception, when considering the price of this one with 7 balls VS the others of the same size available that only have 5 and cost more, I have to recommend this one. I can also recommend it for a gift for that person in your life that is so hard to shop for. Just about everybody would think this is something pretty cool and unusual, and cant help but like it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M1GY1SU76MYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FARV4Q#wasThisHelpful","R2M1GY1SU76MYU","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Even though this knife was made in China it is surprisingly well made. Which is very unusual for something that was made in China where they make the worst products in the world. The one I got actually works like it was made by somebody that could almost be called a craftsman. The steel the blade is made of is of good quality and came with a pretty good edge on it. It only took a couple minutes with my kitchen steel to put a razor edge on it. It opens easily with just the flick of a finger. The blade locks open and is very solidly mounted. It even has an emergency belt cutter built into the back of the handle and a striking point on the end that can be used to break a window made of safety glass. If struck properly and with enough force.If you like collecting knives or are just looking for a nice one for a reasonable price I strongly suggest getting this one.

"Since it is cheap, mine was only $7.91, I didn't really expect too much in the quality department. But even the cheap stuff when it has parts that are easy to make there is no excuse for deliberately making it look like a 2nd grade kid made it in crafts class.It is a unique design with the Dragon's wings being the bottle opener. Just lift the wings as far as they will go and the notch on each wing forms the opener. Pretty simple really but they still managed to make the wings off center on mine. So the notches have one longer than the other so both of them wont fit on a bottle at the same time.The blade starts out as one of the cool looking ones that looks like a snake. Those are a bit difficult to sharpen right but come on, don't use a regular flat grinding wheel on it and take the curves off!I have several unique knives that I paid from around $8 to $18 for and they are nice knives. There's no excuse for making crap when all it takes is a little attention and care about what you are doing to make them come out nice. I know, because I was a machinist for well over 20 years. Running the production machines that made this is what they call a ""put & take job"" As in you stand there all day taking the finished part out and putting the next one in the machine. And its no more difficult to make the part right than it is to make them looking like crap. It just takes a tiny bit of care and attention to and about what you are doing. I could make better looking parts for these while extremely stoned & half asleep.While this is a very poorly made knife, even for as cheap as it is, it's not quite the worst one I've got. It's almost as bad, not quite but almost as bad as the German knife I bought that was supposed to be a classic spring assisted blade that's long and slender with a black handle, silver caps on the ends and a silver Eagle on each side of the handle. When I got the 2 knives I ordered they had swastikas on each side of the handle and looked like they had laid in a gravel parking lot with heavy traffic for a week and been ran over a couple thousand times, in gravel. This one wasn't quite that bad, but close.This is actually a Carnival knife that you win for popping under inflated balloons with a dull dart. Or the ring toss or one of the many other rigged things to take your money while you try to win the giant stuffed animal (that has never been won by anybody and looks forty or fifty years old) for your girlfriend.If you still want this knife for your collection of odd knives it can still be sharpened enough to be a letter opener and you might get lucky and get one with the wings bent right so the bottle opener works. But don't expect anything that looks much like a Dragon Knife.I'll try to get a couple photo's uploaded later so you can see what they really look like. If you still want to get one anyway, good luck.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19XDL7J8TDOIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004511DI8#wasThisHelpful","R19XDL7J8TDOIK","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As somebody else said, this doesn't come with directions. But then it doesn't really need any. What is if for? to keep a bottle of wine cold longer than it would be just sitting on the table. How do you use it? Chill your bottle of wine. You can also chill this in the freezer at the same time. Set Chiller on table, put bottle of wine in it. Enjoy.I think we have gotten used to everything having instructions simplified and written out so that even the dumbest person can follow them. If they did write some out for this they would probably be something like this;Remove OXO Steel Wine Chiller from boxRemove OXO Steel Wine Chiller from plastic bag.Place plastic bag in trash. DO NOT give Plastic Bag to children to play with, Plastic Bag is not a toy and is a suffocation hazard.To use OXO Steel Wine Chiller place Chiller in freezer. If you do not have bottle of wine chilled place bottle of wine in refrigerator at this time to chill.When wine is chilled remove from refrigerator. Remove OXO Steel Wine Chiller from freezer.Place chilled OXO Steel Wine Chiller on table. Place chilled bottle of wine in OXO Steel Wine Chiller.A small towel or cloth can be placed over wine bottle in OXO Steel Wine Chiller to keep it chilled longer.Enjoy.When I read ""Wine Chiller"" I pictured a stainless steel bucket with a bottle of wine and ice in it like in the movies. But this isn't even close to being big enough for ice to chill your bottle of wine. Unless its been crushed down to almost snow. So as a ""Wine Chiller"" its a failure. But for keeping a bottle of wine chilled during dinner it does that pretty well.I found by putting it in the freezer for a half hour or so before using it helps a lot. Then using a small dishtowel or nice cloth napkin to cover it and the bottle of wine in it also helps to keep it chilled longer than just sitting in the bucket.If you are a frequent wine drinker with your dinner then you would probably like one of these. Or even just for that occasional family dinner at the holidays it would look nice on the table. Or one at each end for a large family. If your not a wine drinker then you probably wouldn't have any use for this except as a gift for somebody that is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHD947V4WMWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B6LUAQG#wasThisHelpful","R2RHD947V4WMWI","A19GSC3QMK694Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19GSC3QMK694Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have seen a lot of these body wraps lately and its confusing on what will help and what doesn't. So when the opportunity came up to try a Detox Body Wrap of course I went for it. First I will talk about what comes with this product. You get 8 applications, first you take the bandage and let it soak for 10-15 minutes while this is happening you take a packet of powder add warm water and the clay forms, once this is done you spread it on the area, take the warm bandage, make sure it is not to hot, ring out excess water, apply clay to area and wrap bandage around it. To keep it warm place saran wrap around it. Leave on for one hour. Take off bandage, wash it, wipe off excess clay. After a couple treatments your skin will look and feel tighter in the area. I did my arms where the jiggly are. It works maybe not with just one applications but after a few you will notice a difference. Your skin is also softer and refreshed.*I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R156CHN3G4W3B2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG1NIPY#wasThisHelpful","R156CHN3G4W3B2","A111KLSTKFKPZ6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A111KLSTKFKPZ6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love them I got them. I like using them wit my boot during the cold winter.I was pleased that these socks were wide enough in the calf (I'm one of those wide-calf boot kind of girls) without getting too scrunched up. The height is awesome: while they don't go over the knees (I'm 5'6), they go right to the knees, which means I can wear them with pretty much any boots. I will say, though, having wide calves means these are just tight enough that I don't like to wear them mid-calf with lower boots. I could, but then the socks feel too tight.

"Very nice aloe vera gel. It is different from other aloe gels in that it contains all natural seaweed extract that makes the aloe thicker and absorb quicker. I liked this because the kids always hated the sticky residue from pure aloe vera gel and I had to fight them to let them have me put in on their burns, cuts, etc. Seaweed is also good for your skin by improving its elasticity, texture and tone - which was good for me because I use aloe vera gel in my face toner; body spray; and after-sun spray.

"Still shopping, but leaning toward a Surface 3 over the Surface 3 Pro or any Surface 4 variant. For those scanning reviews to make up *your* mind, the only turn off to these sweet devices is how remarkably non-repairable they are. The case is glued together, mitigating not only the chance to upgrade RAM or SSD card, but battery replacement is problematic, as well as expensive (I've seen articles quoting anywhere form $200-$450).So I am viewing the Surface as sort of disposable. It will last as long as it lasts (which may well be for a while past warranty), and when it breaks or the battery dies I will likely replace it. Therefore the strategy will be to buy CHEAP :>. Not interested in investing over a grand on some variants of the PRO. Rather spend a few hundred, get a great hybrid computing device, and then shed no tears when it dies.I also like that the Surface 3 does not have a fan. Sure, there's a smaller processor, but I am in the Steve Jobs camp that says computers should be seen and not heard. ;>cheers","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OU9OD23FEXJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGNZ4PG#wasThisHelpful","R1OU9OD23FEXJP","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent product from an excellent company. However, its use is tailored for a very specific purpose. It's designed to mainly work with certain other Ubiquiti wireless products. Also, this is not a user friendly push-a-button to configure consumer item. It has a somewhat complex feature array. Just for openers you must know how to change the TCP/IP configuration on your computer from DHCP to a static IP address in order to program the airGateway. Having said that, there are a number of reviews posted on Amazon from folks who do not appear to be IT professionals yet got the job done. The benefit if you go to the trouble of setting this gizmo up is that for its price it's a very solid piece of equipment that doesn't have to be rebooted and futzed with on a daily basis. It just works. Please note there are three different models of the airGateway as described below. But first, what exactly does this little gadget do?The airGateway is a Wireless Access Point (WAP) designed to seamlessly connect to Ubiquiti wireless devices that bring internet to your premises, but do not  to necessarily transmit a WiFi signal throughout that premises. Such devices are typically known as Customer Premises Equipment or CPE. The airGateway is made specifically to plug into the power supply designed for Ubiquiti CPEs. The CPE is typically mounted outdoors for best reception, for example on a roof eve or a pole, in order to make a line-of-site connection to the corresponding radio on the other end of the link. But the power supply for the CPE is normally INSIDE the structure... so plugging an airGateway into the power supply connects it to the CPE and transmits the internet signal it receives via WiFi to the interior of the building.Ubiquiti CPE devices have applications ranging from obtaining internet in rural areas, to RV camping, to boosting weak hotel WiFi signals. In one example, folks living in a rural area might get their internet not from DSL or cable -due to a lack of service in their area- but instead get their internet from a Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) that beams a signal from a nearby hilltop. Often a dedicated CPE device must be installed at the customer's location and pointed directly at the antenna of the transmitter the WISP is using to beam the internet out. This setup makes for a nice reliable connection that can bring the internet into the building via an Ethernet cable run between the CPE and the customer's network, but such a rig does NOT provide a WiFi signal. Since WISPs often use Ubiquiti equipment due to its low cost and high reliability, the company came up with this cheap and effective add-on to create that missing WiFi link. Again, the air Gateway simply plugs into the same power supply (inside the building) that feeds power to the outdoor CPE connecting to the WISP (or whoever). BTW the outdoor Ubiquiti radios usually employed are its ""airMAX"" products such as the NanoBridge, NanoStation, PicoStation, and several other models. Here are some links: (Ubiquiti NB-5G22 NanoBridge M5 Cost-Effective 5GHz 22dbi MIMO) and (Ubiquiti NanoStation locoM2 2.4GHz Indoor/Outdoor airMax 8dBi CPE) and (Ubiquiti PicoStation M2HP 2.4GHz 802.11g/n High Power Access Point). Each model has its own characteristics and is selected based upon the specific environment it is installed into.Another example, seen in several Amazon reviews, is on an RV. If an RV sets up camp in a location that has WiFi, yet the received signal is not strong enough to reach into all the nooks and crannies of the RV, such as someone lying in bed trying to get the weather on their smartphone, then a Ubiquiti NanoStation (as an example) could be installed outside the RV (perhaps mounted on the rear view mirror bracket) and pointed directly toward the park's WiFi antenna. Then an airGateway could be plugged Into the NanoStation's power supply INSIDE the RV and transmit a nice strong signal throughout the vehicle.Yeah, you could use any old wireless router in the RV instead of the airGateway to spread the WiFi around, but why take up the limited space of an RV with a bulky wireless router when an airGateway is tiny, doesn't take up another precious AC outlet, and is cheaper than any [good] WiFi router! This of course is based on having made the investment in a piece of outdoor equipment to pull in a decent signal. And I'll tell you, an externally mounted CPE is a good idea for any frequent RV'r who can't live without internet. I've designed RV park WiFi systems and it is NOT easy to place wireless access points in such a way they send a strong signal into every RV in the park. Too much aluminum reflecting and bouncing the signal all around!As a third and final example I would point you to an excellent review by danijag who used an airGateway coupled to a Ubiquiti CPE to boost the signal from a weak hotel WiFi signal. You could of course use such a set up to capture and rebroadcast ANY weak Wifi signal. The secret that makes all these applications work is that the Ubiquiti CPEs have a directional, HIGH GAIN antenna and a very powerful radio. This enables them to beat out any ""department store"" competitor by a mile when it comes to locking onto a weak signal.

"This is an excellent product from an excellent company. However, its use is tailored for a very specific purpose. It's designed to mainly work with certain other Ubiquiti wireless products. Also, this is not a user friendly push-a-button to configure consumer item. It has a somewhat complex feature array. Just for openers you must know how to change the TCP/IP configuration on your computer from DHCP to a static IP address in order to program the airGateway. Having said that, there are a number of reviews posted on Amazon from folks who do not appear to be IT professionals yet got the job done. The benefit if you go to the trouble of setting this gizmo up is that for its price it's a very solid piece of equipment that doesn't have to be rebooted and futzed with on a daily basis. It just works. Please note there are three different models of the airGateway as described below. But first, what exactly does this little gadget do?The airGateway is a Wireless Access Point (WAP) designed to seamlessly connect to Ubiquiti wireless devices that bring internet to your premises, but do not  to necessarily transmit a WiFi signal throughout that premises. Such devices are typically known as Customer Premises Equipment or CPE. The airGateway is made specifically to plug into the power supply designed for Ubiquiti CPEs. The CPE is typically mounted outdoors for best reception, for example on a roof eve or a pole, in order to make a line-of-site connection to the corresponding radio on the other end of the link. But the power supply for the CPE is normally INSIDE the structure... so plugging an airGateway into the power supply connects it to the CPE and transmits the internet signal it receives via WiFi to the interior of the building.Ubiquiti CPE devices have applications ranging from obtaining internet in rural areas, to RV camping, to boosting weak hotel WiFi signals. In one example, folks living in a rural area might get their internet not from DSL or cable -due to a lack of service in their area- but instead get their internet from a Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) that beams a signal from a nearby hilltop. Often a dedicated CPE device must be installed at the customer's location and pointed directly at the antenna of the transmitter the WISP is using to beam the internet out. This setup makes for a nice reliable connection that can bring the internet into the building via an Ethernet cable run between the CPE and the customer's network, but such a rig does NOT provide a WiFi signal. Since WISPs often use Ubiquiti equipment due to its low cost and high reliability, the company came up with this cheap and effective add-on to create that missing WiFi link. Again, the air Gateway simply plugs into the same power supply (inside the building) that feeds power to the outdoor CPE connecting to the WISP (or whoever). BTW the outdoor Ubiquiti radios usually employed are its ""airMAX"" products such as the NanoBridge, NanoStation, PicoStation, and several other models. Here are some links: (Ubiquiti NB-5G22 NanoBridge M5 Cost-Effective 5GHz 22dbi MIMO) and (Ubiquiti NanoStation locoM2 2.4GHz Indoor/Outdoor airMax 8dBi CPE) and (Ubiquiti PicoStation M2HP 2.4GHz 802.11g/n High Power Access Point). Each model has its own characteristics and is selected based upon the specific environment it is installed into.Another example, seen in several Amazon reviews, is on an RV. If an RV sets up camp in a location that has WiFi, yet the received signal is not strong enough to reach into all the nooks and crannies of the RV, such as someone lying in bed trying to get the weather on their smartphone, then a Ubiquiti NanoStation (as an example) could be installed outside the RV (perhaps mounted on the rear view mirror bracket) and pointed directly toward the park's WiFi antenna. Then an airGateway could be plugged Into the NanoStation's power supply INSIDE the RV and transmit a nice strong signal throughout the vehicle.Yeah, you could use any old wireless router in the RV instead of the airGateway to spread the WiFi around, but why take up the limited space of an RV with a bulky wireless router when an airGateway is tiny, doesn't take up another precious AC outlet, and is cheaper than any [good] WiFi router! This of course is based on having made the investment in a piece of outdoor equipment to pull in a decent signal. And I'll tell you, an externally mounted CPE is a good idea for any frequent RV'r who can't live without internet. I've designed RV park WiFi systems and it is NOT easy to place wireless access points in such a way they send a strong signal into every RV in the park. Too much aluminum reflecting and bouncing the signal all around!As a third and final example I would point you to an excellent review by danijag who used an airGateway coupled to a Ubiquiti CPE to boost the signal from a weak hotel WiFi signal. You could of course use such a set up to capture and rebroadcast ANY weak Wifi signal. The secret that makes all these applications work is that the Ubiquiti CPEs have a directional, HIGH GAIN antenna and a very powerful radio. This enables them to beat out any ""department store"" competitor by a mile when it comes to locking onto a weak signal.

"You have to admit that erecting your own personal cell tower is a pretty cool concept. However, there seems to be a bunch of misleading information about these Verizon network extenders in the reviews and Q&A found throughout Amazon. And the vendor descriptions of the optional external GPS antenna can also be misleading at times. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert, but I've messed with a few of these devices over the years and wish to pass on a few tips regarding what I've learned.TOP 10 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THESE NETWORK EXTENDERS1) What models are available?Model SCS-26UC4 - This is the first  version of the extender introduced in 2009 and is no longer being sold by Verizon, but is available used/refurbished through outlets such as Amazon and eBay. The main difference I am aware of is that this older extender only can only download data at ""1x"" speeds (much slower than 3G). This model also handles fewer simultaneous calls (3) than the updated model noted next. The SCS-26UC4l was reduced in price to $99 (with rebate) when the upgraded model came out, but now usually sells for more used. For a few people however THIS is the preferable model to purchase. I will explain below. BTW - when these extenders first appeared on the market, cell calls placed through them were NOT charged any minutes. It was a truly free call. Those days are long gone as Verizon now charges the minutes based on your calling plan for either extender or cell tower calls.Model SCS-2U01 - This improved model was released around 2010. Mainly it adds 3G data (also known as EVDO or EVolution Data Optimized), so internet speeds are improved. It also handles up to 8 simultaneous calls. These units are still available from Verizon's website, as well as used through 3rd party sites such as Amazon or eBay.Model SCS-2U3100 - This is the 'business' version of the extender, and is available (as of this writing Nov 2015) through Verizon, and again, used via 3rd party sites. This model features self-registration, extended coverage, more simultaneous calls, and can be daisy-chained to up to five business extenders total to greatly increase coverage area. The basic coverage of one unit is advertised as 7,500 sq ft, as opposed to 5,000 sq ft of the model SCS-2U01. To get this range you must register this particular model after it is plugged in and working by dialing #48 on your Verizon cell phone. Until that is done coverage is only a fraction of the 7,500 sq ft advertised.2) Do I need to register my extender?Lots of misconceptions here. NEW extenders purchased from the Verizon website are automatically registered when purchased. The extender is assigned to the Verizon Wireless account you log into (or establish at the time of purchase). The exception is the business model (SCS-2U3100) as described above. USED extenders must also be registered to work (doesn't matter whose account it is registered to), but a used device may or may not be registered when you receive it because the previous owner has the option to UNregister their device.Which begs the perennial question: ""Help! Do I need to RE-register my used device onto my own Verizon account, and if so, how?"" ANSWER: Don't worry about it. In most cases the extender will work just fine as long as it is registered 'somewhere', and I think it's rare for someone to take the time to UNregister their unit. See the troubleshooting section below if your used device does not work before freaking out about registration. Remember that the extender is a one time cost. There are no recurring costs billed to the Verizon account the extender is associated with. Per minute charges are related to the cell phone used, not the extender. The only reason to get the extender assigned to your own Verizon account is to program the one single feature you have control over, which is to setup a prioritized list of phone numbers. For most people though this is a pathetic feature. Reason being, contrary to what's stated in several reviews you can't actually BLOCK certain phones from using the extender. All you can do is enter a list of cell phones that get priority... meaning if all the available slots are used (8 for the current non-business model SCS2U01) then any phone initiating a call whose number is entered in the priority list will bump someone off who is not on the list. Big deal. How many people are going to have 8 simultaneous calls running?Being able to actually block certain numbers from using the device (black listing) and/or allow only certain numbers (white listing) would be a far more practical feature for most residential use. Why? Because an extender can often transmit a cell signal up to hundreds of feet (depending). ANYONE can use that signal... for voice or data! Do you want a bunch of yahoos you don't know using up YOUR internet bandwidth while they try and connect to Netflix via their smartphone and take in a movie? And if you have a data cap on your internet service the issue is compounded. Under the current implementation of the extender (all models) that is exactly what can happen. That is why for some people the older model (SCS-26UC4), which has only 1x data speeds, is preferable. At least with a 1x extender it will throttle any strangers' attempt to gobble up your internet connection.3) Do I  need an external antenna?Misinformation abounds regarding this question. The first thing to understand is that your extender has TWO antennas. The little antenna sticking out of the back of the device is for transmitting (and receiving) the cell signal. The closer a cell phone is to this cellular antenna the more bars appear on the phone.Inside the extender (under the hatch cover on top toward the rear) is the GPS antenna. This antenna has NOTHING to do with the strength of the cell signal or the quality of the call. It's there simply to identify the location of the extender for 911 calls and whatnot. I bring this to your attention because the folks who sell aftermarket external GPS antennas occasionally will lead consumers to believe that their extender will work better and you will ""get more out of your extender"" if you buy an external GPS antenna. Poppycock. Very simply, if the GPS LED is solid blue you don't need another GPS antenna. Repeat, if the GPS LED is blue you are good to go. See below if your GPS LED is red. In that case you may or may not need an external GPS antenna.With that question hopefully settled what remains is; do you need a different cellular antenna? There are indeed aftermarket cellular antennas that can a) increase the range of your extender, and b) focus the signal in a specific area. The stock cell antenna is omnidirectional or just ""omni"", meaning it covers a full 360 degree area. Replacement antennas may be omni as well or be directional to cover a specific area. Just remember in all these examples that unlike WiFi, you can't password protect your extender! It's open to whoever the signal reaches to.Let's start with the simplest cellular antenna replacement; an omni that screws directly in the back of the extender just as the stock one does, but provides greater coverage. I have tested three such antennas. Surprisingly, in spite of claims of higher gain, two of the three replacements were worse than the factory antenna. The third one, a $15 TECHTOO antenna gave about 1 bar of gain over the stock antenna. Not bad for the price, and it is easily the cheapest and quickest way to boost the output from your extender: TECHTOOÆ Wide Band 5dbi 700-2600Mhz 3G 4G LTE Omni Directional Antenna with SMA Male Connector for HUAWEI CPE Router B593/B310/B880/E5172/E5175/E5186/B890 / ZTE MF253/MF283/MF25D/MF28G /MF28D (Black). Don't ever tell Verizon you replaced your antenna because it no doubt breaks your warranty. (i.e. keep the original antenna ;>).Moving up the food chain there are replacement antennas that sit apart from the extender and attach with a cable that provide even more gain. I have one of these on order (Wilson Electronics 800/1900 MHz Magnet Mount Antenna with SMA Male Connector - Retail Packaging - Black), and will update the review after trying it out.If you wish to direct the signal from the extender in a specific direction (excluding other areas from coverage) you need a 'directional' antenna. For example Wilson makes a so-called 'panel' (flat) directional antenna that mounts on the wall and beams the cellular signal in a roughly 70 degree pattern across the horizon. This antenna provides a significant boost in coverage over the aforementioned omni models because of its size, and because the signal is not being radiated in all directions. The model # that has the correct ""SMA"" plug for your extender is 311135 (WILSON ELECTRONICS 311135 Dual-Band 50_ Wall-Mount Panel Antenna).Finally, there are many aftermarket cell ""boosters"" that come with an amplifier and antenna. How do those fit into the equation? I know little of such devices though, except to state with some certainty that boosters cannot distinguish between a Verizon network extender and a ""real"" cell tower (it's like some version of the old Beggin' Strips commercials: ""Dogs don't know it's not a cell tower!""). But to give you an idea, these devices typically have an antenna that you point at the cell tower (or in this case the network extender) and then another antenna that sits on a desk or counter that shoots the signal around the room. Why would you want one of these products? It might make sense if you get good coverage with the Verizon extender around the house but have, say, a pool house or other remote building that only gets a bar or two of coverage. Boosters can cost more than an extender so you have to be prudent here. There is a well rated Wilson amplifier kit costing about $200 that would pick up the signal from the extender at a distance and then re-transmit the signal locally (Wilson Electronics  DT - Cell Phone Signal Boost for Small Home or Office - Retail Packaging - Gray). If you don't have internet at the remote location this product might be a wise choice. But if you do have internet you have to weight the cost against simply purchasing another extender.4) The lights will not all turn blue on my extender!OK. The following bits of knowledge came at the expense of blood, sweat, and even a tear or two. So listen up. Unless all other lights turn blue the SYS LED won't turn blue. From there, decoding the ""Verizon Code"" varies according to whether you have the older 1x model (SCS-26UC4) or the newer 3G model (SCS-2U01)...On the older SCS-26UC4 the GPS LED tends to stays red (solid or flashing) REGARDLESS of what the issue is (like network/internet connection issue or GPS lock issues). For example if the internet connection is down, it's the GPS light that often stays red, not the WAN (Wide Area Network) light as it should. So you have to ignore what the manual says about the LEDs and assume you may have either network issues or GPS issues. Or if you're having a bad hair day, perhaps both. Don't despair, keep reading.Here is a list of issues I've discovered that will prevent the GPS LED from turning blue:a) Extender not registeredb) Hardware failure (rare)c) Incompatible internet routerd) Internet router unpluggede) Internet connection downf) extender is geographically outside Verizon's licensed frequency rangeand finallyg) weak GPS signal (the extender can't see enough GPS satellites to lock to)The above list applies to the newer SCS-2U01 units as well, except the LEDs on that model give better indication as to the issue. If you have a WAN (Internet connection) issue I've found that the WAN light appropriately stays flashing or solid red. The Achilles Heel of the SCS-2U01 is that the  SYS LED will sometimes go blue (which normally indicates all systems are go) temporarily, even if the WAN LED is red. Go figure. Neither model will work however until all lights are blue.But actually, the REAL Achilles Heel of the SCS-2U01 is that it is surprisingly incompatible with a number of brands of internet routers out there. I first spotted an Amazon review noting this, and we too have gone to extender purgatory more than once due to the extender not liking the router. Coverage on how to determine if your extender is cool with your router is in the following troubleshooting section...MAKING THE LIGHTS TURN BLUEa) Wait. Do nothing for an hour or two after you've placed the unit near a window and plugged in power and a network cable running to your router. It can take a newly setup extender that long to lock to GPS and turn all the LEDs blue.b) Be sure the extender is registered. It doesn't matter to what Verizon account. This mostly applies to used units. Try to register the extender to your Verizon Wireless account. Whether the registration is successful or the system complains the device is already registered, you're good to go either way. If the extender is registered to another account then only if you really really want to set which cell phone numbers have priority do you want to go through the hellish experience of actually talking to Verizon and coaxing them to transfer the device into your name. Reviewers report mixed results on this endeavor. And as previously mentioned, charges will NOT rack up on the account of the previous owner. Charges are based on the cell phone using the extender, not the extender itself.c) GPS lock. For the older SCS-26UC4 regardless of what its lights are doing, or the newer SCS-2U01 if its GPS light stays red for more than an hour or two, make sure the extender is placed in view of the open sky. Sticking it near a window is not a guarantee of a GPS lock. Try to place the unit outside where the sky is most open. You must have both power and Ethernet cables connected so you are limited by the length of your cords. THEN WAIT AT LEAST TWO HOURS. If the GPS and SYS light go solid blue in that time you probably need an external GPS antenna.Anecdote: At one of our locations we have a good view of the sky but there are tall redwood trees in one direction and a hill in another direction. This was enough to require an external GPS antenna to get clear of the obstructions. If your extender came with a separate GPS cable then you can simply unplug the GPS antenna (you wiggle it out of its socket) and plug in the cable in its place. If you don't have a cable you can get a 20 footer from Amazon (Universal 20' Antenna Extension SMB Male to SMB Female extention cable 20ft 6M compatiable with SIRIUS XM Radio Garmin GPS Receiver). Sometimes its cheaper to just get the cable with a GPS antenna. I purchased a cheapo $10 GPS antenna here on Amazon (External GPS Antenna with SMB female for Verizon Samsung 3G Network Extender plus led light key chain) with a nearly 10ft cable. So far it works great and has born up against the rain. Also, a company called GILSSON sells a variety of GPS antennas that look to be good quality and have longer length cables available. I have one on order and will update this review after it's been in operation for a while.NOTE: At the time of this writing the only Amazon reseller offering the Gilsson line is a vendor called NAVSPHERE. With a reseller rating of a miserable 86% I therefore chose to pick mine up off eBay.d) Internet connection. There are two things to try here. First, plug the network cable coming from the extender into a port on the router that is already being used by another device and wait 20 minutes. The logic here is simple; individual ports on routers go bad. Second -and this addresses the router incompatibility issue- temporarily plug your extender directly into your broadband connection. Don't worry about rebooting the equipment, just wait 20 minutes. If the lights all turn blue your extender does not like your router.On this last note we were able to solve the problem of two different routers being incompatible with an extender. It's technical but I'll attempt to explain in plain English. In both our cases the router did not have 'DHCP' turned on. This is the service that hands out IP addresses to all devices when they connect (either wirelessly or via plugged into a port on the router). The extender is no exception. It needs an IP address to work. On some more complex home/small office networks another piece of equipment on the network may have the job of assigning IP addresses. But it seems the Verizon network extender wants to get its IP address from the router it is plugged into. So before shopping for a new router have your tech person check to see if DHCP is enabled on the router.After all the above if the unit still won't turn all blue this reviewer is out of ideas. It might be a bad extender, or perhaps you live outside Verizon's ""licensed spectrum"". Verizon has a coverage map that refers to ""Broadband Services ... coverage area"", ""... enhanced Services ... coverage area"", ""Extended Broadband Services ... coverage area"", ""Extended National..."" bla blah blah. It's nearly as complicated as the tax code.5) Can I use the extender with satellite internet?Definitely maybe. You probably know that all calls on a Verizon network extender are routed through your internet connection. Call quality therefore is only as good as your connection to the internet. Normally this is not an issue as voice traffic only needs a fraction of the bandwidth required for, say, music and video. Still, voice traffic is ""real time"" and any hiccups on your internet connection will reflect in call quality, With satellite internet this core equation is multiplied, as the packets of info (voice or data) take a 45,000 mile trip to space and back in addition to wherever else they're headed. And that's just one-way. Still, it can work, albeit with a noticeable delay on each end of the call. You will hear people going :""Hello. Hello??"" because they don't hear you right away. I would recommend being on the latest and greatest satellite service for best results. We are on Wildblue EXEDE and it works OK. At times the EXEDE network gets bogged down and call quality can greatly suffer. This is definitely a Plan B solution.6) Will my non-Verizon prepaid phone that uses the Verizon network work OK?Yes! Any non-Verizon pre-paid phone that uses the Verizon network such as TracFone, StraightTalk and others seems to work fine with the extender (which is interesting because such phones are reported to not work on all Verizon cell towers). The only ""downside"" is that you cannot use these phones to register your extender, because you cannot create a Verizon Wireless account with such phones. If you don't have any actual Verizon phones you can't buy the extender from Verizon because you must have an account to do so. This where Amazon and eBay and such come in. You can just buy the device from such sources. If it arrives already registered you're set. If it is not registered, any friend or relative with a Verizon phone can register it to their account. This in no way affects their service and no charges are levied. See the registration section in this review which explains why I am claiming this.7) Should I buy my extender NEW or USED!!I have to say, I love buying used to save a little money. Bottom line, the used market is about PRICE and RETURNABILITY. If the price is well bellow the $250 dollar cost new, AND you have patience for things maybe going more wrong at first than with a new unit, AND you can return the unit with no hassle, then fine. Just remember also, if you have the Chutzpah to go toe to toe with Verizon about how they SHOULD be pumping 3 or 4 bars into you locale you might get an extender out of them at a discount or for free. It happens, but it may take some tenacity.8) Where should I place my extender?The thing is, the ideal location to get a GPS lock may not be the ideal place for best coverage of the areas important to you. The saving grace is that both the GPS antenna and/or the cellular antenna can be remotely located from the extender. My first strategy would be to go for placing the extender itself in a nice central location for coverage to your phones. If you don't get a blue GPS light in that location you can pull the GPS antenna out of the extender and run a cable to place it in a window (or outside if need be). I like this strategy for two reasons; 1) it is easier and cheaper to remote the GPS antenna than it is the cellular antenna. 2) I don't think its necessarily wise to follow conventional wisdom and keep the extender itself in a window to get a GPS lock. The extender runs pretty warm to begin with. Placing it in direct sunlight will just make it run hotter and almost certainly shorten its life. I'd much rather stick just the little GPS antenna in a window pane. The lady of the house will likely appreciate the improved aesthetics as well. :>9) MISC:How to tell if you're cell phone is connected to your extender as opposed to a cell tower:Dial #48How to read the signal strength reaching your phone:Android phone: System Settings / About Phone / StatusiPhone:Dial *3001#12345#* (google: ""lifehacker See the Actual Signal Strength on Your iPhone"" for more)10) Soapboxit would be nice to see Verizon launch the 3rd generation of the extender that included touch-ups like the ability to white list and black list phone number, LEDs that display properly, better setup instructions, and lower pricing. Unfortunately there is a built in conflict of interest here. First, for each call made on an extender, which uses the public internet to route the call as opposed to Verizon's cell tower network, that is one less call Verizon needs to beef up its own network to handle. Plus at $250 to $399 a pop, Verizon is making a handy little profit off you for each extender it sells. Since Verizon is the only supplier of compatible extenders they pretty much own the market for these devices and thus there is no pressure to lower pricing or improve the extender. ;>Cheers!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q460VPO1G4XG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RCCVF0#wasThisHelpful","R1Q460VPO1G4XG","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You have to admit that erecting your own personal cell tower is a pretty cool concept. However, there seems to be a bunch of misleading information about these Verizon network extenders in the reviews and Q&A found throughout Amazon. And the vendor descriptions of the optional external GPS antenna can also be misleading at times. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert, but I've messed with a few of these devices over the years and wish to pass on a few tips regarding what I've learned.TOP 10 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THESE NETWORK EXTENDERS1) What models are available?Model SCS-26UC4 - This is the first  version of the extender introduced in 2009 and is no longer being sold by Verizon, but is available used/refurbished through outlets such as Amazon and eBay. The main difference I am aware of is that this older extender only can only download data at ""1x"" speeds (much slower than 3G). This model also handles fewer simultaneous calls (3) than the updated model noted next. The SCS-26UC4l was reduced in price to $99 (with rebate) when the upgraded model came out, but now usually sells for more used. For a few people however THIS is the preferable model to purchase. I will explain below. BTW - when these extenders first appeared on the market, cell calls placed through them were NOT charged any minutes. It was a truly free call. Those days are long gone as Verizon now charges the minutes based on your calling plan for either extender or cell tower calls.Model SCS-2U01 - This improved model was released around 2010. Mainly it adds 3G data (also known as EVDO or EVolution Data Optimized), so internet speeds are improved. It also handles up to 8 simultaneous calls. These units are still available from Verizon's website, as well as used through 3rd party sites such as Amazon or eBay.Model SCS-2U3100 - This is the 'business' version of the extender, and is available (as of this writing Nov 2015) through Verizon, and again, used via 3rd party sites. This model features self-registration, extended coverage, more simultaneous calls, and can be daisy-chained to up to five business extenders total to greatly increase coverage area. The basic coverage of one unit is advertised as 7,500 sq ft, as opposed to 5,000 sq ft of the model SCS-2U01. To get this range you must register this particular model after it is plugged in and working by dialing #48 on your Verizon cell phone. Until that is done coverage is only a fraction of the 7,500 sq ft advertised.2) Do I need to register my extender?Lots of misconceptions here. NEW extenders purchased from the Verizon website are automatically registered when purchased. The extender is assigned to the Verizon Wireless account you log into (or establish at the time of purchase). The exception is the business model (SCS-2U3100) as described above. USED extenders must also be registered to work (doesn't matter whose account it is registered to), but a used device may or may not be registered when you receive it because the previous owner has the option to UNregister their device.Which begs the perennial question: ""Help! Do I need to RE-register my used device onto my own Verizon account, and if so, how?"" ANSWER: Don't worry about it. In most cases the extender will work just fine as long as it is registered 'somewhere', and I think it's rare for someone to take the time to UNregister their unit. See the troubleshooting section below if your used device does not work before freaking out about registration. Remember that the extender is a one time cost. There are no recurring costs billed to the Verizon account the extender is associated with. Per minute charges are related to the cell phone used, not the extender. The only reason to get the extender assigned to your own Verizon account is to program the one single feature you have control over, which is to setup a prioritized list of phone numbers. For most people though this is a pathetic feature. Reason being, contrary to what's stated in several reviews you can't actually BLOCK certain phones from using the extender. All you can do is enter a list of cell phones that get priority... meaning if all the available slots are used (8 for the current non-business model SCS2U01) then any phone initiating a call whose number is entered in the priority list will bump someone off who is not on the list. Big deal. How many people are going to have 8 simultaneous calls running?Being able to actually block certain numbers from using the device (black listing) and/or allow only certain numbers (white listing) would be a far more practical feature for most residential use. Why? Because an extender can often transmit a cell signal up to hundreds of feet (depending). ANYONE can use that signal... for voice or data! Do you want a bunch of yahoos you don't know using up YOUR internet bandwidth while they try and connect to Netflix via their smartphone and take in a movie? And if you have a data cap on your internet service the issue is compounded. Under the current implementation of the extender (all models) that is exactly what can happen. That is why for some people the older model (SCS-26UC4), which has only 1x data speeds, is preferable. At least with a 1x extender it will throttle any strangers' attempt to gobble up your internet connection.3) Do I  need an external antenna?Misinformation abounds regarding this question. The first thing to understand is that your extender has TWO antennas. The little antenna sticking out of the back of the device is for transmitting (and receiving) the cell signal. The closer a cell phone is to this cellular antenna the more bars appear on the phone.Inside the extender (under the hatch cover on top toward the rear) is the GPS antenna. This antenna has NOTHING to do with the strength of the cell signal or the quality of the call. It's there simply to identify the location of the extender for 911 calls and whatnot. I bring this to your attention because the folks who sell aftermarket external GPS antennas occasionally will lead consumers to believe that their extender will work better and you will ""get more out of your extender"" if you buy an external GPS antenna. Poppycock. Very simply, if the GPS LED is solid blue you don't need another GPS antenna. Repeat, if the GPS LED is blue you are good to go. See below if your GPS LED is red. In that case you may or may not need an external GPS antenna.With that question hopefully settled what remains is; do you need a different cellular antenna? There are indeed aftermarket cellular antennas that can a) increase the range of your extender, and b) focus the signal in a specific area. The stock cell antenna is omnidirectional or just ""omni"", meaning it covers a full 360 degree area. Replacement antennas may be omni as well or be directional to cover a specific area. Just remember in all these examples that unlike WiFi, you can't password protect your extender! It's open to whoever the signal reaches to.Let's start with the simplest cellular antenna replacement; an omni that screws directly in the back of the extender just as the stock one does, but provides greater coverage. I have tested three such antennas. Surprisingly, in spite of claims of higher gain, two of the three replacements were worse than the factory antenna. The third one, a $15 TECHTOO antenna gave about 1 bar of gain over the stock antenna. Not bad for the price, and it is easily the cheapest and quickest way to boost the output from your extender: TECHTOO¬Æ Wide Band 5dbi 700-2600Mhz 3G 4G LTE Omni Directional Antenna with SMA Male Connector for HUAWEI CPE Router B593/B310/B880/E5172/E5175/E5186/B890 / ZTE MF253/MF283/MF25D/MF28G /MF28D (Black). Don't ever tell Verizon you replaced your antenna because it no doubt breaks your warranty. (i.e. keep the original antenna ;>).Moving up the food chain there are replacement antennas that sit apart from the extender and attach with a cable that provide even more gain. I have one of these on order (Wilson Electronics 800/1900 MHz Magnet Mount Antenna with SMA Male Connector - Retail Packaging - Black), and will update the review after trying it out.If you wish to direct the signal from the extender in a specific direction (excluding other areas from coverage) you need a 'directional' antenna. For example Wilson makes a so-called 'panel' (flat) directional antenna that mounts on the wall and beams the cellular signal in a roughly 70 degree pattern across the horizon. This antenna provides a significant boost in coverage over the aforementioned omni models because of its size, and because the signal is not being radiated in all directions. The model # that has the correct ""SMA"" plug for your extender is 311135 (WILSON ELECTRONICS 311135 Dual-Band 50_ Wall-Mount Panel Antenna).Finally, there are many aftermarket cell ""boosters"" that come with an amplifier and antenna. How do those fit into the equation? I know little of such devices though, except to state with some certainty that boosters cannot distinguish between a Verizon network extender and a ""real"" cell tower (it's like some version of the old Beggin' Strips commercials: ""Dogs don't know it's not a cell tower!""). But to give you an idea, these devices typically have an antenna that you point at the cell tower (or in this case the network extender) and then another antenna that sits on a desk or counter that shoots the signal around the room. Why would you want one of these products? It might make sense if you get good coverage with the Verizon extender around the house but have, say, a pool house or other remote building that only gets a bar or two of coverage. Boosters can cost more than an extender so you have to be prudent here. There is a well rated Wilson amplifier kit costing about $200 that would pick up the signal from the extender at a distance and then re-transmit the signal locally (Wilson Electronics  DT - Cell Phone Signal Boost for Small Home or Office - Retail Packaging - Gray). If you don't have internet at the remote location this product might be a wise choice. But if you do have internet you have to weight the cost against simply purchasing another extender.4) The lights will not all turn blue on my extender!OK. The following bits of knowledge came at the expense of blood, sweat, and even a tear or two. So listen up. Unless all other lights turn blue the SYS LED won't turn blue. From there, decoding the ""Verizon Code"" varies according to whether you have the older 1x model (SCS-26UC4) or the newer 3G model (SCS-2U01)...On the older SCS-26UC4 the GPS LED tends to stays red (solid or flashing) REGARDLESS of what the issue is (like network/internet connection issue or GPS lock issues). For example if the internet connection is down, it's the GPS light that often stays red, not the WAN (Wide Area Network) light as it should. So you have to ignore what the manual says about the LEDs and assume you may have either network issues or GPS issues. Or if you're having a bad hair day, perhaps both. Don't despair, keep reading.Here is a list of issues I've discovered that will prevent the GPS LED from turning blue:a) Extender not registeredb) Hardware failure (rare)c) Incompatible internet routerd) Internet router unpluggede) Internet connection downf) extender is geographically outside Verizon's licensed frequency rangeand finallyg) weak GPS signal (the extender can't see enough GPS satellites to lock to)The above list applies to the newer SCS-2U01 units as well, except the LEDs on that model give better indication as to the issue. If you have a WAN (Internet connection) issue I've found that the WAN light appropriately stays flashing or solid red. The Achilles Heel of the SCS-2U01 is that the  SYS LED will sometimes go blue (which normally indicates all systems are go) temporarily, even if the WAN LED is red. Go figure. Neither model will work however until all lights are blue.But actually, the REAL Achilles Heel of the SCS-2U01 is that it is surprisingly incompatible with a number of brands of internet routers out there. I first spotted an Amazon review noting this, and we too have gone to extender purgatory more than once due to the extender not liking the router. Coverage on how to determine if your extender is cool with your router is in the following troubleshooting section...MAKING THE LIGHTS TURN BLUEa) Wait. Do nothing for an hour or two after you've placed the unit near a window and plugged in power and a network cable running to your router. It can take a newly setup extender that long to lock to GPS and turn all the LEDs blue.b) Be sure the extender is registered. It doesn't matter to what Verizon account. This mostly applies to used units. Try to register the extender to your Verizon Wireless account. Whether the registration is successful or the system complains the device is already registered, you're good to go either way. If the extender is registered to another account then only if you really really want to set which cell phone numbers have priority do you want to go through the hellish experience of actually talking to Verizon and coaxing them to transfer the device into your name. Reviewers report mixed results on this endeavor. And as previously mentioned, charges will NOT rack up on the account of the previous owner. Charges are based on the cell phone using the extender, not the extender itself.c) GPS lock. For the older SCS-26UC4 regardless of what its lights are doing, or the newer SCS-2U01 if its GPS light stays red for more than an hour or two, make sure the extender is placed in view of the open sky. Sticking it near a window is not a guarantee of a GPS lock. Try to place the unit outside where the sky is most open. You must have both power and Ethernet cables connected so you are limited by the length of your cords. THEN WAIT AT LEAST TWO HOURS. If the GPS and SYS light go solid blue in that time you probably need an external GPS antenna.Anecdote: At one of our locations we have a good view of the sky but there are tall redwood trees in one direction and a hill in another direction. This was enough to require an external GPS antenna to get clear of the obstructions. If your extender came with a separate GPS cable then you can simply unplug the GPS antenna (you wiggle it out of its socket) and plug in the cable in its place. If you don't have a cable you can get a 20 footer from Amazon (Universal 20' Antenna Extension SMB Male to SMB Female extention cable 20ft 6M compatiable with SIRIUS XM Radio Garmin GPS Receiver). Sometimes its cheaper to just get the cable with a GPS antenna. I purchased a cheapo $10 GPS antenna here on Amazon (External GPS Antenna with SMB female for Verizon Samsung 3G Network Extender plus led light key chain) with a nearly 10ft cable. So far it works great and has born up against the rain. Also, a company called GILSSON sells a variety of GPS antennas that look to be good quality and have longer length cables available. I have one on order and will update this review after it's been in operation for a while.NOTE: At the time of this writing the only Amazon reseller offering the Gilsson line is a vendor called NAVSPHERE. With a reseller rating of a miserable 86% I therefore chose to pick mine up off eBay.d) Internet connection. There are two things to try here. First, plug the network cable coming from the extender into a port on the router that is already being used by another device and wait 20 minutes. The logic here is simple; individual ports on routers go bad. Second -and this addresses the router incompatibility issue- temporarily plug your extender directly into your broadband connection. Don't worry about rebooting the equipment, just wait 20 minutes. If the lights all turn blue your extender does not like your router.On this last note we were able to solve the problem of two different routers being incompatible with an extender. It's technical but I'll attempt to explain in plain English. In both our cases the router did not have 'DHCP' turned on. This is the service that hands out IP addresses to all devices when they connect (either wirelessly or via plugged into a port on the router). The extender is no exception. It needs an IP address to work. On some more complex home/small office networks another piece of equipment on the network may have the job of assigning IP addresses. But it seems the Verizon network extender wants to get its IP address from the router it is plugged into. So before shopping for a new router have your tech person check to see if DHCP is enabled on the router.After all the above if the unit still won't turn all blue this reviewer is out of ideas. It might be a bad extender, or perhaps you live outside Verizon's ""licensed spectrum"". Verizon has a coverage map that refers to ""Broadband Services ... coverage area"", ""... enhanced Services ... coverage area"", ""Extended Broadband Services ... coverage area"", ""Extended National..."" bla blah blah. It's nearly as complicated as the tax code.5) Can I use the extender with satellite internet?Definitely maybe.

It's open to whoever the signal reaches to.Let's start with the simplest cellular antenna replacement; an omni that screws directly in the back of the extender just as the stock one does, but provides greater coverage. I have tested three such antennas. Surprisingly, in spite of claims of higher gain, two of the three replacements were worse than the factory antenna. The third one, a $15 TECHTOO antenna gave about 1 bar of gain over the stock antenna. Not bad for the price, and it is easily the cheapest and quickest way to boost the output from your extender: TECHTOO¬Æ Wide Band 5dbi 700-2600Mhz 3G 4G LTE Omni Directional Antenna with SMA Male Connector for HUAWEI CPE Router B593/B310/B880/E5172/E5175/E5186/B890 / ZTE MF253/MF283/MF25D/MF28G /MF28D (Black). Don't ever tell Verizon you replaced your antenna because it no doubt breaks your warranty. (i.e. keep the original antenna ;>).Moving up the food chain there are replacement antennas that sit apart from the extender and attach with a cable that provide even more gain. I have one of these on order (Wilson Electronics 800/1900 MHz Magnet Mount Antenna with SMA Male Connector - Retail Packaging - Black), and will update the review after trying it out.If you wish to direct the signal from the extender in a specific direction (excluding other areas from coverage) you need a 'directional' antenna. For example Wilson makes a so-called 'panel' (flat) directional antenna that mounts on the wall and beams the cellular signal in a roughly 70 degree pattern across the horizon. This antenna provides a significant boost in coverage over the aforementioned omni models because of its size, and because the signal is not being radiated in all directions. The model # that has the correct ""SMA"" plug for your extender is 311135 (WILSON ELECTRONICS 311135 Dual-Band 50_ Wall-Mount Panel Antenna).Finally, there are many aftermarket cell ""boosters"" that come with an amplifier and antenna. How do those fit into the equation? I know little of such devices though, except to state with some certainty that boosters cannot distinguish between a Verizon network extender and a ""real"" cell tower (it's like some version of the old Beggin' Strips commercials: ""Dogs don't know it's not a cell tower!""). But to give you an idea, these devices typically have an antenna that you point at the cell tower (or in this case the network extender) and then another antenna that sits on a desk or counter that shoots the signal around the room. Why would you want one of these products? It might make sense if you get good coverage with the Verizon extender around the house but have, say, a pool house or other remote building that only gets a bar or two of coverage. Boosters can cost more than an extender so you have to be prudent here. There is a well rated Wilson amplifier kit costing about $200 that would pick up the signal from the extender at a distance and then re-transmit the signal locally (Wilson Electronics  DT - Cell Phone Signal Boost for Small Home or Office - Retail Packaging - Gray). If you don't have internet at the remote location this product might be a wise choice. But if you do have internet you have to weight the cost against simply purchasing another extender.4) The lights will not all turn blue on my extender!OK. The following bits of knowledge came at the expense of blood, sweat, and even a tear or two. So listen up. Unless all other lights turn blue the SYS LED won't turn blue. From there, decoding the ""Verizon Code"" varies according to whether you have the older 1x model (SCS-26UC4) or the newer 3G model (SCS-2U01)...On the older SCS-26UC4 the GPS LED tends to stays red (solid or flashing) REGARDLESS of what the issue is (like network/internet connection issue or GPS lock issues). For example if the internet connection is down, it's the GPS light that often stays red, not the WAN (Wide Area Network) light as it should. So you have to ignore what the manual says about the LEDs and assume you may have either network issues or GPS issues. Or if you're having a bad hair day, perhaps both. Don't despair, keep reading.Here is a list of issues I've discovered that will prevent the GPS LED from turning blue:a) Extender not registeredb) Hardware failure (rare)c) Incompatible internet routerd) Internet router unpluggede) Internet connection downf) extender is geographically outside Verizon's licensed frequency rangeand finallyg) weak GPS signal (the extender can't see enough GPS satellites to lock to)The above list applies to the newer SCS-2U01 units as well, except the LEDs on that model give better indication as to the issue. If you have a WAN (Internet connection) issue I've found that the WAN light appropriately stays flashing or solid red. The Achilles Heel of the SCS-2U01 is that the  SYS LED will sometimes go blue (which normally indicates all systems are go) temporarily, even if the WAN LED is red. Go figure. Neither model will work however until all lights are blue.But actually, the REAL Achilles Heel of the SCS-2U01 is that it is surprisingly incompatible with a number of brands of internet routers out there. I first spotted an Amazon review noting this, and we too have gone to extender purgatory more than once due to the extender not liking the router. Coverage on how to determine if your extender is cool with your router is in the following troubleshooting section...MAKING THE LIGHTS TURN BLUEa) Wait. Do nothing for an hour or two after you've placed the unit near a window and plugged in power and a network cable running to your router. It can take a newly setup extender that long to lock to GPS and turn all the LEDs blue.b) Be sure the extender is registered. It doesn't matter to what Verizon account. This mostly applies to used units. Try to register the extender to your Verizon Wireless account. Whether the registration is successful or the system complains the device is already registered, you're good to go either way. If the extender is registered to another account then only if you really really want to set which cell phone numbers have priority do you want to go through the hellish experience of actually talking to Verizon and coaxing them to transfer the device into your name. Reviewers report mixed results on this endeavor. And as previously mentioned, charges will NOT rack up on the account of the previous owner. Charges are based on the cell phone using the extender, not the extender itself.c) GPS lock. For the older SCS-26UC4 regardless of what its lights are doing, or the newer SCS-2U01 if its GPS light stays red for more than an hour or two, make sure the extender is placed in view of the open sky. Sticking it near a window is not a guarantee of a GPS lock. Try to place the unit outside where the sky is most open. You must have both power and Ethernet cables connected so you are limited by the length of your cords. THEN WAIT AT LEAST TWO HOURS. If the GPS and SYS light go solid blue in that time you probably need an external GPS antenna.Anecdote: At one of our locations we have a good view of the sky but there are tall redwood trees in one direction and a hill in another direction. This was enough to require an external GPS antenna to get clear of the obstructions. If your extender came with a separate GPS cable then you can simply unplug the GPS antenna (you wiggle it out of its socket) and plug in the cable in its place. If you don't have a cable you can get a 20 footer from Amazon (Universal 20' Antenna Extension SMB Male to SMB Female extention cable 20ft 6M compatiable with SIRIUS XM Radio Garmin GPS Receiver). Sometimes its cheaper to just get the cable with a GPS antenna. I purchased a cheapo $10 GPS antenna here on Amazon (External GPS Antenna with SMB female for Verizon Samsung 3G Network Extender plus led light key chain) with a nearly 10ft cable. So far it works great and has born up against the rain. Also, a company called GILSSON sells a variety of GPS antennas that look to be good quality and have longer length cables available. I have one on order and will update this review after it's been in operation for a while.NOTE: At the time of this writing the only Amazon reseller offering the Gilsson line is a vendor called NAVSPHERE. With a reseller rating of a miserable 86% I therefore chose to pick mine up off eBay.d) Internet connection. There are two things to try here. First, plug the network cable coming from the extender into a port on the router that is already being used by another device and wait 20 minutes. The logic here is simple; individual ports on routers go bad. Second -and this addresses the router incompatibility issue- temporarily plug your extender directly into your broadband connection. Don't worry about rebooting the equipment, just wait 20 minutes. If the lights all turn blue your extender does not like your router.On this last note we were able to solve the problem of two different routers being incompatible with an extender. It's technical but I'll attempt to explain in plain English. In both our cases the router did not have 'DHCP' turned on. This is the service that hands out IP addresses to all devices when they connect (either wirelessly or via plugged into a port on the router). The extender is no exception. It needs an IP address to work. On some more complex home/small office networks another piece of equipment on the network may have the job of assigning IP addresses. But it seems the Verizon network extender wants to get its IP address from the router it is plugged into. So before shopping for a new router have your tech person check to see if DHCP is enabled on the router.After all the above if the unit still won't turn all blue this reviewer is out of ideas. It might be a bad extender, or perhaps you live outside Verizon's ""licensed spectrum"". Verizon has a coverage map that refers to ""Broadband Services ... coverage area"", ""... enhanced Services ... coverage area"", ""Extended Broadband Services ... coverage area"", ""Extended National..."" bla blah blah. It's nearly as complicated as the tax code.5) Can I use the extender with satellite internet?Definitely maybe. You probably know that all calls on a Verizon network extender are routed through your internet connection. Call quality therefore is only as good as your connection to the internet. Normally this is not an issue as voice traffic only needs a fraction of the bandwidth required for, say, music and video. Still, voice traffic is ""real time"" and any hiccups on your internet connection will reflect in call quality, With satellite internet this core equation is multiplied, as the packets of info (voice or data) take a 45,000 mile trip to space and back in addition to wherever else they're headed. And that's just one-way. Still, it can work, albeit with a noticeable delay on each end of the call. You will hear people going :""Hello. Hello??"" because they don't hear you right away. I would recommend being on the latest and greatest satellite service for best results. We are on Wildblue EXEDE and it works OK. At times the EXEDE network gets bogged down and call quality can greatly suffer. This is definitely a Plan B solution.6) Will my non-Verizon prepaid phone that uses the Verizon network work OK?Yes! Any non-Verizon pre-paid phone that uses the Verizon network such as TracFone, StraightTalk and others seems to work fine with the extender (which is interesting because such phones are reported to not work on all Verizon cell towers). The only ""downside"" is that you cannot use these phones to register your extender, because you cannot create a Verizon Wireless account with such phones. If you don't have any actual Verizon phones you can't buy the extender from Verizon because you must have an account to do so. This where Amazon and eBay and such come in. You can just buy the device from such sources. If it arrives already registered you're set. If it is not registered, any friend or relative with a Verizon phone can register it to their account. This in no way affects their service and no charges are levied. See the registration section in this review which explains why I am claiming this.7) Should I buy my extender NEW or USED!!I have to say, I love buying used to save a little money. Bottom line, the used market is about PRICE and RETURNABILITY. If the price is well bellow the $250 dollar cost new, AND you have patience for things maybe going more wrong at first than with a new unit, AND you can return the unit with no hassle, then fine. Just remember also, if you have the Chutzpah to go toe to toe with Verizon about how they SHOULD be pumping 3 or 4 bars into you locale you might get an extender out of them at a discount or for free. It happens, but it may take some tenacity.8) Where should I place my extender?The thing is, the ideal location to get a GPS lock may not be the ideal place for best coverage of the areas important to you. The saving grace is that both the GPS antenna and/or the cellular antenna can be remotely located from the extender. My first strategy would be to go for placing the extender itself in a nice central location for coverage to your phones. If you don't get a blue GPS light in that location you can pull the GPS antenna out of the extender and run a cable to place it in a window (or outside if need be). I like this strategy for two reasons; 1) it is easier and cheaper to remote the GPS antenna than it is the cellular antenna. 2) I don't think its necessarily wise to follow conventional wisdom and keep the extender itself in a window to get a GPS lock. The extender runs pretty warm to begin with. Placing it in direct sunlight will just make it run hotter and almost certainly shorten its life. I'd much rather stick just the little GPS antenna in a window pane. The lady of the house will likely appreciate the improved aesthetics as well. :>9) MISC:How to tell if you're cell phone is connected to your extender as opposed to a cell tower:Dial #48How to read the signal strength reaching your phone:Android phone: System Settings / About Phone / StatusiPhone:Dial *3001#12345#* (google: ""lifehacker See the Actual Signal Strength on Your iPhone"" for more)10) Soapboxit would be nice to see Verizon launch the 3rd generation of the extender that included touch-ups like the ability to white list and black list phone number, LEDs that display properly, better setup instructions, and lower pricing. Unfortunately there is a built in conflict of interest here. First, for each call made on an extender, which uses the public internet to route the call as opposed to Verizon's cell tower network, that is one less call Verizon needs to beef up its own network to handle. Plus at $250 to $399 a pop, Verizon is making a handy little profit off you for each extender it sells. Since Verizon is the only supplier of compatible extenders they pretty much own the market for these devices and thus there is no pressure to lower pricing or improve the extender. ;>Cheers!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN5IXFE513VSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056C0KI4#wasThisHelpful","RN5IXFE513VSV","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You have to admit that erecting your own personal cell tower is a pretty cool concept. However, there seems to be a bunch of misleading information about these Verizon network extenders in the reviews and Q&A found throughout Amazon. And the vendor descriptions of the optional external GPS antenna can also be misleading at times. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert, but I've messed with a few of these devices over the years and wish to pass on a few tips regarding what I've learned.TOP 10 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THESE NETWORK EXTENDERS1) What models are available?Model SCS-26UC4 - This is the first  version of the extender introduced in 2009 and is no longer being sold by Verizon, but is available used/refurbished through outlets such as Amazon and eBay. The main difference I am aware of is that this older extender only can only download data at ""1x"" speeds (much slower than 3G). This model also handles fewer simultaneous calls (3) than the updated model noted next. The SCS-26UC4l was reduced in price to $99 (with rebate) when the upgraded model came out, but now usually sells for more used. For a few people however THIS is the preferable model to purchase. I will explain below. BTW - when these extenders first appeared on the market, cell calls placed through them were NOT charged any minutes. It was a truly free call. Those days are long gone as Verizon now charges the minutes based on your calling plan for either extender or cell tower calls.Model SCS-2U01 - This improved model was released around 2010. Mainly it adds 3G data (also known as EVDO or EVolution Data Optimized), so internet speeds are improved. It also handles up to 8 simultaneous calls. These units are still available from Verizon's website, as well as used through 3rd party sites such as Amazon or eBay.Model SCS-2U3100 - This is the 'business' version of the extender, and is available (as of this writing Nov 2015) through Verizon, and again, used via 3rd party sites. This model features self-registration, extended coverage, more simultaneous calls, and can be daisy-chained to up to five business extenders total to greatly increase coverage area. The basic coverage of one unit is advertised as 7,500 sq ft, as opposed to 5,000 sq ft of the model SCS-2U01. To get this range you must register this particular model after it is plugged in and working by dialing #48 on your Verizon cell phone. Until that is done coverage is only a fraction of the 7,500 sq ft advertised.2) Do I need to register my extender?Lots of misconceptions here. NEW extenders purchased from the Verizon website are automatically registered when purchased. The extender is assigned to the Verizon Wireless account you log into (or establish at the time of purchase). The exception is the business model (SCS-2U3100) as described above. USED extenders must also be registered to work (doesn't matter whose account it is registered to), but a used device may or may not be registered when you receive it because the previous owner has the option to UNregister their device.Which begs the perennial question: ""Help! Do I need to RE-register my used device onto my own Verizon account, and if so, how?"" ANSWER: Don't worry about it. In most cases the extender will work just fine as long as it is registered 'somewhere', and I think it's rare for someone to take the time to UNregister their unit. See the troubleshooting section below if your used device does not work before freaking out about registration. Remember that the extender is a one time cost. There are no recurring costs billed to the Verizon account the extender is associated with. Per minute charges are related to the cell phone used, not the extender. The only reason to get the extender assigned to your own Verizon account is to program the one single feature you have control over, which is to setup a prioritized list of phone numbers. For most people though this is a pathetic feature. Reason being, contrary to what's stated in several reviews you can't actually BLOCK certain phones from using the extender. All you can do is enter a list of cell phones that get priority... meaning if all the available slots are used (8 for the current non-business model SCS2U01) then any phone initiating a call whose number is entered in the priority list will bump someone off who is not on the list. Big deal. How many people are going to have 8 simultaneous calls running?Being able to actually block certain numbers from using the device (black listing) and/or allow only certain numbers (white listing) would be a far more practical feature for most residential use. Why? Because an extender can often transmit a cell signal up to hundreds of feet (depending). ANYONE can use that signal... for voice or data! Do you want a bunch of yahoos you don't know using up YOUR internet bandwidth while they try and connect to Netflix via their smartphone and take in a movie? And if you have a data cap on your internet service the issue is compounded. Under the current implementation of the extender (all models) that is exactly what can happen. That is why for some people the older model (SCS-26UC4), which has only 1x data speeds, is preferable. At least with a 1x extender it will throttle any strangers' attempt to gobble up your internet connection.3) Do I  need an external antenna?Misinformation abounds regarding this question. The first thing to understand is that your extender has TWO antennas. The little antenna sticking out of the back of the device is for transmitting (and receiving) the cell signal. The closer a cell phone is to this cellular antenna the more bars appear on the phone.Inside the extender (under the hatch cover on top toward the rear) is the GPS antenna. This antenna has NOTHING to do with the strength of the cell signal or the quality of the call. It's there simply to identify the location of the extender for 911 calls and whatnot. I bring this to your attention because the folks who sell aftermarket external GPS antennas occasionally will lead consumers to believe that their extender will work better and you will ""get more out of your extender"" if you buy an external GPS antenna. Poppycock. Very simply, if the GPS LED is solid blue you don't need another GPS antenna. Repeat, if the GPS LED is blue you are good to go. See below if your GPS LED is red. In that case you may or may not need an external GPS antenna.With that question hopefully settled what remains is; do you need a different cellular antenna? There are indeed aftermarket cellular antennas that can a) increase the range of your extender, and b) focus the signal in a specific area. The stock cell antenna is omnidirectional or just ""omni"", meaning it covers a full 360 degree area. Replacement antennas may be omni as well or be directional to cover a specific area. Just remember in all these examples that unlike WiFi, you can't password protect your extender!

Bottom line, the used market is about PRICE and RETURNABILITY. If the price is well bellow the $250 dollar cost new, AND you have patience for things maybe going more wrong at first than with a new unit, AND you can return the unit with no hassle, then fine. Just remember also, if you have the Chutzpah to go toe to toe with Verizon about how they SHOULD be pumping 3 or 4 bars into you locale you might get an extender out of them at a discount or for free. It happens, but it may take some tenacity.8) Where should I place my extender?The thing is, the ideal location to get a GPS lock may not be the ideal place for best coverage of the areas important to you. The saving grace is that both the GPS antenna and/or the cellular antenna can be remotely located from the extender. My first strategy would be to go for placing the extender itself in a nice central location for coverage to your phones. If you don't get a blue GPS light in that location you can pull the GPS antenna out of the extender and run a cable to place it in a window (or outside if need be). I like this strategy for two reasons; 1) it is easier and cheaper to remote the GPS antenna than it is the cellular antenna. 2) I don't think its necessarily wise to follow conventional wisdom and keep the extender itself in a window to get a GPS lock. The extender runs pretty warm to begin with. Placing it in direct sunlight will just make it run hotter and almost certainly shorten its life. I'd much rather stick just the little GPS antenna in a window pane. The lady of the house will likely appreciate the improved aesthetics as well. :>9) MISC:How to tell if you're cell phone is connected to your extender as opposed to a cell tower:Dial #48How to read the signal strength reaching your phone:Android phone: System Settings / About Phone / StatusiPhone:Dial *3001#12345#* (google: ""lifehacker See the Actual Signal Strength on Your iPhone"" for more)10) Soapboxit would be nice to see Verizon launch the 3rd generation of the extender that included touch-ups like the ability to white list and black list phone number, LEDs that display properly, better setup instructions, and lower pricing. Unfortunately there is a built in conflict of interest here. First, for each call made on an extender, which uses the public internet to route the call as opposed to Verizon's cell tower network, that is one less call Verizon needs to beef up its own network to handle. Plus at $250 to $399 a pop, Verizon is making a handy little profit off you for each extender it sells. Since Verizon is the only supplier of compatible extenders they pretty much own the market for these devices and thus there is no pressure to lower pricing or improve the extender. ;>Cheers!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R222QAQY5YZK4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LWDX6M#wasThisHelpful","R222QAQY5YZK4V","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hello. Is it worth the time to view this film? YES. Is this film an unbiased portrayal of what happened to the US financial system in 2008? NO.Too Big To Fail is an entertaining drama, BUT it is just that, a drama, not a documentary. You cannot take everything you see in this film to the bank. The movies made about the financial crisis fall into one of two categories; reenactment drama / documentary. Be aware which category the movies you choose to watch regarding this event fall into. This reenactment is well acted (a blessing as well as a curse), it paints a picture of who some of the key players were -during the crisis but not necessarily leading up to the crisis- and it describes a few of the elements that triggered the events (though the actual explanation of what created the crisis is lacking). But when unrecorded conversations that took place behind closed doors are scripted by someone who wasn't there, and character attributes are assigned to actors playing key people in positions of great power, truth sometimes becomes a casualty of drama, not to mention any (well intentioned or otherwise) agenda by the book author / film maker that creeps in. Watching this production is an exercise of separating the wheat from the chaff.If you want to view an actual documentary that depicts the events as they occurred check out ""Inside Job"". This production interviews the actual people working in the industry at the time (or at least the ones willing to appear on camera, which in and of itself is telling).To further illustrate the point let's take one player as an example; Treasury Secretary Henry [Hank] Paulson. In Too Big to Fail, Hank Paulson is portrayed as a caring, compassionate man caught up in events he had no hand in creating. Inside Job, however, airs actual video tape of Paulson speaking, and the impression one gets from noting his behavior on camera is a bit different from the Too Big To Fail characterization. Aging but still handsome actor William Hurt portrays an integrous, nurturing Hank Paulson in Too Big. Is that the real Paulson? Did Paulson's tenure at investment bank Goldman Sachs not contribute to the crisis? We have some quotes from Wiki that tend to counter the Hank Paulson portrayed in Too Big:1) In April 2007, he delivered an upbeat assessment of the economy, saying growth was healthy and the housing market was nearing a turnaround. ""All the signs I look at"" show ""the housing market is at or near the bottom,"" Paulson said in a speech to a business group in New York. The U.S. economy is ""very healthy"" and ""robust,"" Paulson said.2) On August 10, 2008, Secretary Paulson told NBC's Meet the Press that he had no plans to inject any capital into Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. On September 7, 2008, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac went into conservatorship.3) Time Magazine has Paulson as one of the ""25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis"".None of this comes out in Too Big.Inside Job further points out that Paulson supported lifting the leverage limits on Investment banks (which made the problem far worse), as well as resisting regulation of the issuance of insurance policies (CDSs) that broke the back of AIG (the institution which had to be bailed out by the Federal government). I would add that Paulson is on record in support of a major law put on the books known as the 'Dodd-Frank' bill. What does this mean? It is pretty much agreed that what enabled the 2008 financial crisis was the repeal of a post 1930s depression law that for over half a century had kept banks from doing precisely what they did that caused the crisis (along with unregulated derivatives). The law was referred to as Glass-Steagall and was repealed in 1999. You can draw a direct line from the repeal of Glass-Steagall to the near failure of the US financial system in 2008. Yet, rather than simply put Glass-Steagall back on the books, law makers passed the monstrously sized, never read by any politician, Dodd-Frank bill instead. Result? Today the financial system is more highly leveraged than it was in 2008. Nothing has been fixed under Dodd-Frank. So what's the deal with Paulson? Is he a professional liar, inept, deluded, ill-educated, corrupt? I don't know. It's just that to answer that question we need more than what Too Big gives us. I would recommend watching 'Hank: Five Years From the Brink', a interview based documentary focusing exclusively on Hank Paulson's point of view on the crisis. His demeanor tends to reflect what William Hurt put forth in Too Big, and he convincingly explains away the charges related to him saying one thing and then doing something else. Yet there seems to a few pieces missing from his story. All in all I would say 'Hank' is well worth viewing.By the way, if you want to watch a pure dramatization of the financial crisis that does not spin the players into looking like innocents who are nobly trying to keep the train on the track, check out Margin Call. Although the film depicts a fictitious event (a composite of actual people and events, really), the story is very real in its depiction of the temptation, rationalization, greed, hubris, and braggadocio that allowed such dangerous bets to be placed with YOUR money.---------------Note: This whole topic is not past history... it is current events unfolding in an extended timeline. The stage is set for this too happen again, albeit in a different form.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RO1JNSKYL81P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089DWJ9K#wasThisHelpful","R2RO1JNSKYL81P","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 2008 documentary ostensibly describes the decaying infrastructure in America, but is mostly focused on the Katrina disaster of 2005. Much coverage is given to illustrate the physical damage caused by failed levees, the toll the disaster took on the residents, and the historical pre-events that contributed to the disaster.Even though it's now been years since Katrina, the problems that led up to the disaster are still with us. It is helpful therefore to go through this documentary and refresh your memory about what went wrong, because the root cause of Katrina is still with us and is likely to manifest somewhere in the future.Having said that I would like to depart from the other reviews and cast a warning to viewers about the slant of this film. If you tend to think of a ""documentary"" film as an unbiased examination of a topic, be careful here. Many are not, certainly not this one. So please *think* as you watch it. The film steers you toward a particular set of conclusions about what caused Katrina, and I for one think the producer missed the real point. The producer/writer/director, Leslie Carde, would have us believe that, other than the Army Corp of Engineers as the key culprits, that underneath that is big business and mean old uncaring conservatives not holding the Corp accountable. (Disclaimer: I am neither a conservative or a liberal, and this is not a hit piece on liberals. We're going for something deeper here.)Leslie, who has directed nothing before or after this documentary, has steeply slanted this film. She used mood music as a soundtrack, to tell us when to be sad, rather than letting the horrifying footage of the destroyed city of New Orleans tell that story on its own. She used actor Richard Dreyfuss as the narrator, who breaks out his most nasal, accusatory, you-can-tell-they-are-guily-by-the-way-I-am-sneering voice, rather than a more neutral narrator such as well credentialed Peter Coyote (or simply use an unknown). Recall that Dreyfuss played the mean old corrupt republican in the great movie An American President (you could just see him oozing with joy over the part).Where Leslie excels in the film is pointing out that the Army Corp of Engineers, a governmental, quasi-military agency, is a morally bankrupt institution that has completely failed in its mission to serve the citizenry (hint: it now serves only itself and its benefactors). She got that one dead on the nose. The evidence shows clearly in the film. In fact, I would like to call your attention to one particular scene where an Army Corp of Engineers spokesman is holding a press conference --dressed in military camouflage fatigues-- while he lies his head off to the audience. This is hilarious because the basic purpose of camouflage clothing is to make yourself invisible to the enemy. And that is exactly what the man is doing... trying to obfuscate the truth.Where Leslie veers of course is in the films repeated insinuation (both covert and overt) that the mean old conservatives only care about business, and care not about the people. The finger pointing encompasses the Bushes, both the [then] President George W. and brother Jeb. I'm sure those two are guilty of plenty of something, but Leslie thinks that's the end of the road. Here we are in 2014, with a democratic president approaching the back half of his second term... and how many stories have you seen broadcast about him completing the needed work in New Orleans?My point is, when people polarize such issues, we end up in a non-stop, ever escalating blame-game and never get to the root of the problem. In my view there are at least two more layers of the onion that can be peeled off here. The first point is that government proves over and over that is not capable of such tasks. Government, anyone's government, is architecturally handicapped from taking on the administration of, well... almost anything. Now this is not a libertarian calling for the dismantling of government. But there is an inherent problem that once you turn a job over to the government, one of the fundamental legs of free enterprise is kicked out; INCENTIVE. When the success or failure of an enterprise depends upon the success or failure of its endeavors, it is MOTIVATED to the best job it can. Otherwise everyone gets fired and goes home because the customers don't come back.But when the paycheck comes from Uncle Sam, and over time the entity receiving those checks learn that they continue to arrive regardless of a project's success, the WHOLE PARADIGM CHANGES. The entity evolves into a monster that sucks up more resources than it ever gives back in work product. Why? There's no reason to do things any other way. There's no penalty. As the documentary states, in spite of obvious negligence and culpability in the Katrina disaster, not one Army Corp of Engineers personnel lost their job, let alone went to jail. (Does this remind of an event from our more recent past? Say, around 2008?).So what is the solution? Do we turn everything possible over to private industry? Well, as Michael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street, ""Same dog, different fleas"". Meaning, private industry has its own special way of corrupting government contracts. No, we need to peel off another layer of that onion. I know this sounds trite to say, but the deeper problem, affecting not just government, but all levels of society, is that we have lost sight of our basic principals; morality, integrity, ethics, personal responsibility. We now tolerate what was once intolerable. Too many of us give into temptation, taking the quick and easy path. It's not just our politicians giving into the lobbyists. It is a broad spectrum decay. We are losing our ability to stand up and say ""Stop. Stop! This is wrong. And I'm not going to let you continue, even if it cost me my _____ (fill in the blank)"".I don't know what the answer to this last one is. I just tend to think that until we start focusing there, or on the *next* layer of the onion, people in positions of influence such as Leslie Carde, however well-intentioned, are going to take our eye off the ball. Don't let that happen.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LHI921Y79BZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099SDNNU#wasThisHelpful","R2LHI921Y79BZD","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hello. This review is primarily geared for those who subscribe to the science of Applied Kinesiology for determining the efficacy of a health supplement. We tested this brand of matcha using Applied Kinesiology by first collecting all the health claims related to matcha in general and tested each claim individually using an experienced Applied Kinesiology practitioner. We also tested specifically on the purity of this Kiss Me Organics brand. The statements are listed below along with the results. In short, the testing indicates that Kiss Me Organics Matcha Green Tea Powder is not only full of nutritional value, it is free of any industrial pollutants.For those unfamiliar with Applied Kinesiology, colloquially known as ""muscle testing"", it as a highly accurate method (in the hands of the right practitioner) of ascertaining both the health of an individual as well as determining the efficacy of food and nutritional supplements. Muscle testing works on the basis of what the elderly female practitioner who introduced me to this science 20 years ago characterized as 'body wisdom'. Your body is highly cognizant of its state of health, what it is missing nutritionally, as well as the purity and potency of any supplement it comes in contact with. There is literally a magnetic field surrounding the body that strengthens or weakens when exposed to a supplement. What I've learned over the years in using Applied Kinesiology (which responds to changes in that field) is that the mind/body connection is so strong and so discerning, that specific statements regarding the characteristics of a supplement will produce a Kinesiological response (such as 'is there heavy metal contamination'). A few years ago I hesitantly started posting Amazon reviews with the results of muscle testing various products. I was half expecting the reviews to be immediately down-voted (and thus never seen by others). Rather, it seems that a lot of folks are tuned into muscle testing and the reviews have been well received. I included an anecdote in one review describing a sort of 'blind testing' experience that testifies to the effectiveness of muscle testing here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NDIZDWP080A7/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm.These statements are in regard to Kiss Me Organics Matcha Green Tea Powder. For each statement, when the body goes weak the statement evaluates as 'not true' (no). When the body goes strong the statement evaluates as 'true' (yes).This is a good product: YESHas nutritional value: YESImproves memory: NOIncreases energy: YESImproves skin health: YESIncrease ability to mentally focus: YESContains antioxidants: YESGenerates new brain cells: YESHelps prevent cancer: YESHelps prevent heart disease: YESImproves general health: YESFree from harmful industrial pollutants: YESFree from lead: YESFree from harmful heavy metals: YESHelps burn fat: YESHelps during meditation: YESThe manner in which the reviewer prepared the matcha for consumption maintained the full nutritional properties of the powder: YESNotes:1) These testing results are NOT from Kiss Me Organics. They had nothing whatsoever to do with these tests. The reviewer is NOT a doctor (but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night ;> ). Consider this information anecdotal.2) The first statement, ""this is a good product"", is admittedly rather generic and not all that scientific. However, I have been using that phraseology for 20 years. It's a habit, but it is a good way to start because if the result is NO, it usually means the product should not be consumed and we don't waste time going any further.3) Regarding the statement about the matcha being prepared properly... I prepared the matcha using a very basic recipe from the guidebook (boiling water and simmered almond milk). I wanted to be sure that the hot water did not destroy the nutritional properties of the matcha. Results indicate it is safe to use hot water.4) Regarding amounts and how long a bag of this matcha will last... The net weight listed on the bag is 4oz. We weighed the contents on an electronic scale and the reading was exactly 4oz. Converted to teaspoons, 4oz equates to 24 tsp. HOWEVER, that conversion is for liquids. Powders will have varying bulk. I believe that is why when you look through the Q&A section you find several different answers regarding how long a bag of Kiss Me Organics matcha will last. In fact, we spooned out the entire bag we received using a calibrated teaspoon measure used in baking and got about 40 teaspoons! So how much should you take each day? I don't know. Muscle testing showed 1tsp/day for me, but everyone is individual.Anyway, this is the first Amazon review of health supplement I've posted such a detailed breakdown for. This is partially because of the concern regarding products from China (which is my concern too), but also, due to the good feedback on past reviews of this nature... I am getting braver. As many understand far too well, between polluted air and water, depleted soils, and genetically modified seeds and foodstuffs, it's harder than ever to navigate our way to healthy living. Added to that, many feel that we cannot trust our government to provide accurate testing of our food supply. We are sick and stressed out, and the need for accurate sources of information about what to put in our bodies is paramount. Properly utilized, Applied Kinesiology cuts through all the concerns about efficacy, the worries about inclusion of industrial byproducts, the question of organic or not, trusting FDA test results, and what not. The key is to find a good Applied Kinesiology practitioner you can work with. They are worth their weight in gold. Muscle testing is sometimes controversial, but I've found that is due to the practitioner not being trained in a few simple protocols that insure uniform test results.FULL DISCLOSURE: I received a generic email that Kiss Me Organics sent out to a group of Amazon reviewers, offering to send a bag of matcha in exchange for a review. Absolutely no promises regarding the review were asked of me (nor were any given). And I suppose that I should also admit that, no, I in fact did not stay at a Holiday Inn last night.To your health. :>","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OL49AGX219EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDT116M#wasThisHelpful","R2OL49AGX219EN","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've never watched the ""Spy TV"" of the 60s you are in for a treat. Two of the more serious endeavors in the television realm was the American based 'I Spy' series, starring the inimitable Bill Cosby and the show's co-creator Robert Culp, and the British based 'Danger Man' series (known as 'Secret Agent' in America) starring the enigmatic Patrick McGoohan. Spinoffs such as The Avengers, Get Smart, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., and The Saint were a bit more tongue-in-cheek entrees to say the least. Mission Impossible was a serious drama but not quite in the same vein as I Spy and Danger Man. These two shows were true contemporaries (although the temporal overlap was minor), and comparing I Spy to Danger Man helps ferret out the strengths of both shows. Each series is well worth viewing.To set a context, Danger Man came out in 1960. It was pre-James Bond, pre-I Spy, and pre-most anything else in the genre. Danger Man, which began life as a Ω hour production and later morphed into a 1 hour show in 1964, launched the first of the solo, lone wolf-esk, righter-of-wrong characters with that all important ultra-cool substrate. 6'2"" consummate actor Patrick McGoohan IS secret agent John Drake. Just as Peter Falk fully embodied 'Columbo' (a show that received both McGoohan and Culp as guest stars) it is impossible to imagine anyone other than McGoohan in the John Drake role. As with I Spy's Kelly Robinson & Alexander Scott, Danger Man's Drake traveled the world, engaging in high intrigue across other lands and within other cultures.And it is the traveling element that let's us draw our first distinction between I Spy and Danger Man. I Spy was shot on location! With few exceptions, Danger Man was shot in the studio, with stock footage of other countries cleverly blended in. But I Spy was truly shot on location. They actually took the crew to Italy, to Greece, to Spain and to Asia. When you're watching I Spy you are getting a glimpse of what it looked like around the world in the 60s. In my view this is one of the best reasons to go through the series. It is 'boots on the ground' realism as we follow Robinson and Scott on their world-wide adventures.Having said that, I have to be quite frank and point out that I Spy does not hold up as well as Danger Man. Danger Man (both the ¬Ω hr and 1 hr versions) had very tight scripts, thanks in large part to the constant involvement of the show's creator (and writing contributor) Ralph Smart, as well as strong input from McGoohan. This may be hard to believe but I don't think I've ever seen a bad Danger Man. I Spy on the other hand sprouted a few stinker episodes. There is one reason for this; weak writing. Robert Culp actually discusses the show's writing in the commentary track he recorded for several episodes. The concept of I Spy was great, with Culp and Cosby adeptly pulling off the playful banter that was the substrate of the show. But the thing was, the writers often didn't get it. They often wrote *under* the show (scripts were often loose and full of plot holes) as opposed writing to what Culp/Cosby were capable of executing. If you are a ""cross the Ts and dot the I's"" kind of viewer some of the I Spy episodes are nearly unwatchable.However, the chemistry of Culp and Cosby, the locations shooting with its voyeuristic look at the 60s is without compare. I don't think I'd buy the whole series, but there are some great episodes (with specific recommendations from other reviewers). Conversely, I do have the entire Danger Man series. If you check it out don't overlook the earlier ¬Ω hr series. It is surprisingly well done. They somehow managed to contain an integral story arc in that 28 or so minutes. The intro of this first series also has a very Bond-like McGoohan introducing himself as ""Drake .... John Drake"". This, two years before Sean Connery introduced himself as Bond ... James Bond in Dr. No!The last contrasting feature I can think to bring up is the use of firearms. Patrick McGoohan, who was a very moral man and had a heavy influence on the John Drake character, rarely used a gun. He wanted a family show, with minimal violence and sex. Drake was all about brains over brawn, and thanks to great writing the gun element is not missed. Scott and Robinson are more conventional spys and are rarely caught not packing. The pair are somewhat discreet with their use of unnecessary gun play however, so I would say this difference in the shows is less about any I Spy violence and more about the extra work required by the Danger Man writing staff to get Drake out of a jam without the quick and easy plot device afforded by a gun.Music-wise I Spy and Danger Man are on similar footing, with memorable scores for both series. The 1960-62 ¬Ω hr Danger Man has a punchy, jazzy theme, with an even punchier theme accompanying the 1964-66 1 hr version (sold in the USA as Secret Agent, with the unforgettable Johnny Rivers theme). I absolutely love the I Spy theme as well, which rests nicely on the opening visuals where Kelly Robinson, in the blink of an eye transforms from a racket swinging tennis bum to an armed spy, taking the shot, and disappearing through the doorway formed by the upper case ""I"" in the title. So, a total of four themes... all of them winners (as is true of so many 60s TV shows).ps - Given the claim made about Danger Man being one of the first spy dramas with a super cool agent, it should be noted that a production of Ian Fleming's 'Casino Royale' was aired in the 1950s on live TV in America. You can find this short but excellent production included in the extras on the DVD for the 1967 parody version of Casino Royale starring Peter Sellers. In another interesting parallel between John Drake and James Bond, the Bond in this 50's production is an AMERICAN working for the CIA. Likewise the early Danger Man series had John Drake also portrayed as an American, albeit working for NATO. All subsequent Drake/Bond characters were of course British.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FT4IG2MPTSEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYPOI4C#wasThisHelpful","R1FT4IG2MPTSEK","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you've never watched the ""Spy TV"" of the 60s you are in for a treat. Two of the more serious endeavors in the television realm was the American based 'I Spy' series, starring the inimitable Bill Cosby and the show's co-creator Robert Culp, and the British based 'Danger Man' series (known as 'Secret Agent' in America) starring the enigmatic Patrick McGoohan. Spinoffs such as The Avengers, Get Smart, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., and The Saint were a bit more tongue-in-cheek entrees to say the least. Mission Impossible was a serious drama but not quite in the same vein as I Spy and Danger Man. These two shows were true contemporaries (although the temporal overlap was minor), and comparing I Spy to Danger Man helps ferret out the strengths of both shows. Each series is well worth viewing.To set a context, Danger Man came out in 1960. It was pre-James Bond, pre-I Spy, and pre-most anything else in the genre. Danger Man, which began life as a ¬Ω hour production and later morphed into a 1 hour show in 1964, launched the first of the solo, lone wolf-esk, righter-of-wrong characters with that all important ultra-cool substrate. 6'2"" consummate actor Patrick McGoohan IS secret agent John Drake. Just as Peter Falk fully embodied 'Columbo' (a show that received both McGoohan and Culp as guest stars) it is impossible to imagine anyone other than McGoohan in the John Drake role. As with I Spy's Kelly Robinson & Alexander Scott, Danger Man's Drake traveled the world, engaging in high intrigue across other lands and within other cultures.And it is the traveling element that let's us draw our first distinction between I Spy and Danger Man. I Spy was shot on location! With few exceptions, Danger Man was shot in the studio, with stock footage of other countries cleverly blended in. But I Spy was truly shot on location. They actually took the crew to Italy, to Greece, to Spain and to Asia. When you're watching I Spy you are getting a glimpse of what it looked like around the world in the 60s. In my view this is one of the best reasons to go through the series. It is 'boots on the ground' realism as we follow Robinson and Scott on their world-wide adventures.Having said that, I have to be quite frank and point out that I Spy does not hold up as well as Danger Man. Danger Man (both the ¬Ω hr and 1 hr versions) had very tight scripts, thanks in large part to the constant involvement of the show's creator/producer (and writing contributor) Ralph Smart, as well as strong input from McGoohan (and with several episodes directed by Peter Yates, who directed Steve McQueen in Bullitt!). This may be hard to believe but I don't think I've ever seen a bad Danger Man. I Spy on the other hand sprouted a few stinker episodes. There is one reason for this; weak writing. Robert Culp actually discusses the show's writing in the commentary track he recorded for several episodes. The concept of I Spy was great, with Culp and Cosby adeptly pulling off the playful banter that was the substrate of the show. But the thing was, the writers often didn't get it. They often wrote *under* the show (scripts were often loose and full of plot holes) as opposed writing to what Culp/Cosby were capable of executing.However, the chemistry of Culp and Cosby, the locations shooting with its voyeuristic look at the 60s is without compare. I don't think I'd buy the whole series, but there are some great episodes (with specific recommendations from other reviewers). Conversely, I do have the entire Danger Man series. If you check it out don't overlook the earlier ¬Ω hr series. It is surprisingly well done. They somehow managed to contain an integral story arc in that 28 or so minutes. The intro of this first series also has a very Bond-like McGoohan introducing himself as ""Drake .... John Drake"". This, two years before Sean Connery introduced himself as Bond ... James Bond in Dr. No!The last contrasting feature I can think to bring up is the use of firearms. Patrick McGoohan, who was a very moral man and had a heavy influence on the John Drake character, rarely used a gun. He wanted a family show, with minimal violence and sex. Drake was all about brains over brawn, and thanks to great writing the gun element is not missed. Scott and Robinson are more conventional spys and are rarely caught not packing. The pair are somewhat discreet with their use of unnecessary gun play however, so I would say this difference in the shows is less about any I Spy violence and more about the extra work required by the Danger Man writing staff to get Drake out of a jam without the quick and easy plot device afforded by a gun.Music-wise I Spy and Danger Man are on similar footing, with memorable scores for both series. The 1960-62 ¬Ω hr Danger Man has a punchy, jazzy theme, with an even punchier theme accompanying the 1964-66 1 hr version (sold in the USA as Secret Agent, with the unforgettable Johnny Rivers theme). I absolutely love the I Spy theme as well, which rests nicely on the opening visuals where Kelly Robinson, in the blink of an eye transforms from a racket swinging tennis bum to an armed spy, taking the shot, and disappearing through the doorway formed by the upper case ""I"" in the title.

"1) Not Your Father's Cast IronAnyone familiar with the cast iron products of yesteryear will have to lower their expectations for this stove considerably. It is a very cheap, lightweight cast. This stove is simply another in the long line of lower quality, non-existent QC products from China. The first stove I received was missing the 4 legs, and the replacement was cast so poorly I had to drill out one of the holes where the burner attaches to the frame in order to get the mounting screw through it.2) Disposable Canister WarningIf you are planning on connecting a disposable 'Coleman style' (#1 1lb) propane canister to this stove you will need not one, but TWO accessories. First, you need the hose and regulator assembly pictured on this page in the ""Frequently bought together"" section (Sportsman LPHK5 5-Foot Propane Regulator Hose Kit). That gives you the regulator and the connection to the stove. However, the connector on this kit only allows attachment to a standard refillable propane tank (FEMALE Type 1 ACME), not to a disposable canister. For that you need an additional adapter to convert the Type 1 connector to the 1"" threads on a canister (Camp Chef Disposable Bottle Adapter).It took me a while to figure this all out because the company that distributes Sportsman products, Buffalo Tools, insisted that the LPHK5 hose/regulator would work directly with the canisters. Yes, I called them before ordering. But alas, they were mistaken. So the website description as well as the labeling on the box, is a bit misleading. This left me to enter the myriad, often confusing world of propane connectors, adapters, fittings and so forth and such as. I don't think the people at Buffalo have ever actually seen these stoves in person. I now have more info about propane connectors rolling around my brain than I should, but no worry, it should all be forgotten in a week or two.By the way, I did find an adapter that allows connecting a propane canister directly to the stove. This would negate the need to buy the regulator/hose kit. The thing is, I already have a different brand propane stove that works that way, and the problem is it's hard to regulate the flame. I seriously doubt if the valve on this stove allows for fine control of the flame, so even though the regulator may not be required to lower the pressure from the 1lb canisters, the flow adjustment on the regulator should help with flame control (I will update the review when I have used the stove more).So, Amazon defines three stars = OK, and that's just about right. It's clear from other reviews that the stoves do work. I'm going to keep and use mine for two reasons; 1) the price is right. It won't take too many cookouts to ""amortize"" the investment. Secondly, there appears to be no market for folks who wouldn't mind spending a little more for better quality. It seems prices jump WAY UP from here, and I have to wonder how the quality is on the expensive camping stoves as well. Hint: I'm not going to risk finding out.[UPDATE SEP, 2014]Dropping star rating TO 2 stars. Since I bought my unit for $23.90 in June of 2014 the price has nearly doubled. This makes this $50, larger, more sturdy stove (Bayou Classic Single Burner Patio Stove) a better alternative as it comes with the hose you have to pay $20 extra for with this stove.[UPDATE DEC, 2014Price is back down to mid-twenties so star rating back to three. Clearly the seller is trying to find the optimum price point. Under $25 and this stove is still recommended with above caveats.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAIUAD7AZHD0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094BPHAO#wasThisHelpful","RAIUAD7AZHD0R","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only came to Amazon looking for TP because I wasn't able to get to the store, and supplies were dwindling. Surprisingly I Found a price on a 48 roll package that was less than my local brick & motor outlet. But what was really surprising is that there are literally thousands of Amazon reviews on the subject of TP. What was really really surprising was that so many reviews are negative. In short, many people are unhappy with the quality of their toilet paper!I read a bunch of the reviews and started to realize that this tissue issue is actually a reflection of the state of modern consumerism. It seems that many reviewers might be holding the wrong parties responsible for their dooty dilemma. People deserve to know the big picture about why TP, as well as most other consumer products so often disappoint. For those interested in this subject matter, here is one person's attempt to address the question. First, let's round up the usual suspects...Suspect #1 - SelectionCould it be that the selection of TP is insufficient? This does not seem likely as TP is now distinguished by a seemingly infinite number of criteria: # of rolls in package, # of plys, roll size, sheet size, single or double roll, overall square footage, diameter of cardboard tube, tightness of tissue wrapped on roll, softness level, eco-friendly packaging, septic safe, scented vs unscented, virgin vs recycled paper, frustration-free packaging, where purchased, date of purchase, does it shred or leave ""dingles"" behind, odor (separate attribute from Scented vs unscented), and pattern (some people don't like hearts and flowers embossed on the sheets).Plenty of choice there. The TP isle at the giant retailers seems to run a good 2 miles these days. In fact its almost information overload. The purchase of TP is now a REALLY BIG DEAL that requires gathering statistical information, creating a decision tree, and performing complex calculations in order to derive the correct brand/model to purchase for your family. (btw - I wouldn't be surprised if some of these TP formulas have been adopted on Wall Street to calculate derivative return ratios).So it seems selection is more than adequate.Suspect #2 - Spoiled ConsumersAre we just a bunch of whiny, complacent, spoiled customers? We consumers have it all, and we're still not happy. Right?Perhaps, but reviewers seem to be arguing not for better TP, but simply a return to the TP of yesteryear. They claim that TP quality is rolling downhill. Do we consumers not have a right to have our nether-lands properly attended to in the manner in which we've become accustomed? I think the blame lies elsewhere.Suspect #3 - Corporate GreedClearly it's the TP makers who are the culprit here. They are trying to shrink the size of our TP, hoping we won't see it. They are using low-grade pulp, thinking we won't feel it. They give us double rolls one the one hand and then shrink them back to the size of a single roll with the other hand. They try to distract us with embossed floral patterns (which adds bulk but not paper). And .... they even imagine that we won't notice if the TP disintegrates and leaves shreds about. Who checks?It's pure corporate greed folks!!!OK. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Calm down. To be fair, the greedy corporations probably have some kind of lame excuse for their behavior. So let's hear it.... Well... costs are up! Pulp, processing plants, labor, insurance, embossing machines... all cost more than they used to. What's more, you `consumers' don't want to pay any more. You buy on price. Charmin has to compete with Scott, who has to compete with AngelSoft, and we ALL have to compete with Kirkland! If one of us raises our price on TP and the others don't follow, we are shortly out-of-business. And guess what... if we all got together and agreed to raise prices at the same time you would accuse us of everything from collusion to anti-trust behavior.[I tried to to look up the historical price of TP at this point. Results were spotty, although I did find a 1960 grocery store flyer showing 1,000 sheet rolls of Scott tissue going for 33‚Çµ a roll. But there is good historical data on the postage stamp. And if you think about it the two products are more similar than they first appear. They are both paper products, and a lot of energy and water goes into the production of paper. Both products also have transportation costs. The big difference between TP and postage stamps (other than the obvious), is that there is only one place to buy stamps! For the purposes of mailing a physical letter, the post office doesn't really have any competition. The post office therefore has more freedom to reflect the true cost of the stamp in the price. In 1950 a stamp costs 3‚Çµ. By 1968 a stamp had doubled in price to 6‚Çµ. By 1975 it had doubled again to 13‚Çµ. And by 1988 the price had again doubled to 25‚Çµ. Getting the idea? TP makers don't have that kind of latitude because their competitors would have them for lunch.]Suspect #4 - InflationIs it possible that the real culprit here is simply inflation? That insidious robber of wealth, that creeping crud that dilutes our purchasing power, that once great tool that was at first used, then mis-used, then ab-used. Inflation is an ideal suspect, but do you know where it comes from? I mean really? How about a quick primer?a) Inflation is the simplest thing in the world to understand. Inflation is the diluting of the currency. It's printing more money than the economy is geared for. Any time you dilute something, like watering down say, liquor, or gasoline (lower octane number), it becomes weaker. It loses its power. The same is true of currency. If you print money faster than the economy is growing its supply of goods and services you are diluting the currency. Economists call it `monetary inflation'. Inflate the money supply too much then you get more and more people with money in their hands trying to buy the same amount of goods. When that happens prices tend to go up. That's called `price inflation'. Monetary inflation often (but not always) leads to price inflation. Simple supply and demand. Every consumer innately understands supply and demand.b) Historically, all currencies that have come, end up going. They have all died out at some point (not too many Roman Denarius in circulation, eh?). New forms of currency replace old forms of currency. The life of a currency can be extended however. If a [paper] currency is tied to a commodity on a fixed basis (like 1 quatloo = 1 bushel of corn) it is difficult to dilute. Quatloos can't be printed without more corn being planted. Historically, the commodity most often used to back a currency though is gold or silver. Corn gets consumed, so gold, which is rare, rarely consumed, recognizable, divisible, hard to counterfeit, and is really cool and shiny, just works out better.c) US dollars used to be backed by gold. The currency therefore was quite stable. A citizen (the old name for consumers) could walk into a bank and exchange a $20 bill for a $20 gold coin. But to stimulate the economy after the Great Depression of the 1930s President Roosevelt made it illegal for citizens to own gold. Thus they could no longer exchange their promissory notes (currency) for actual gold. And thus, the government was able to start tinkering with the money supply. And that is when price inflation took off in this country (at least for this current inflation cycle. I'm simplifying).d) Although it was illegal for citizens to own gold, foreign countries maintained the right to redeem US currency for gold, at a fixed price of $35 oz. This helped keep the international monetary system stable. The US dollar was `as good as gold'. But in the 1960s the US began to seriously inflate the money supply. In particular, the money supply was inflated under President Johnson, with his `Guns & Butter' policy; a plan to both pay for the Vietnam war, while maintaining a high standard of living for US consumers. As a result, prices started to rise. But as everything started to cost more gold was still pegged at $35 oz. As gold started to become worth more than $35 in the free market, countries like France started redeeming dollars for gold. Yes, those dirty, selfish Frenchies had the gall (it as actually French President *De Gaulle*) to recognize that gold had become worth more than the US currency it was supposedly to be pegged to. How dare the French try and hedge against rising prices around the world. We should have switched from french-fries to freedom-fries back then! Anyway, to solve the problem of foreigners draining America's gold stash President Nixon (are you starting to see a pattern here?) put the kybosh on gold sales. Dollars were no no longer redeemable in gold by ANYONE.e) With the dollar now unfettered from the nuisance of being backed by a commodity, the US government (primarily through the Federal Reserve) was free to expand the money supply as it saw fit. This in-turn triggered the inflationary years of the 1970s that those who were there still remember. The problem of course continues today, and the result is both rising prices as well as lowered quantity and quality of goods (4-packs of high fructose corn syrup Coke instead of 6-packs of sugar based Coke, etc.)Suspect #5 - The GovernmentSo... it's the government's fault that TP ain't what it used to be!? Yes. No. You see, it can be argued that the government was told it could get away with inflating the currency. Uh huh. Government economic policy has been influenced by... economists.Suspect #6 - EconomistsIf you don't know anything about economists all you need to know is one thing; economists are wrong as often about the economy as a broken watch is about the time of day. Obviously that is an opinion, and I should therefore add a disclaimer that I myself am not an economist (but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night).The economist who wielded the strongest influence on government policy was one John Maynard Keynes. Keynes came forth during the Great Depression with a philosophy that boiled down to: We need to spend our way out of the depression. And if we don't have the money, spend it anyway. In fact, Keynes argued that not only is deficit spending tolerable, it's helpful. In other words, Keynes believed in monetary inflation. And indeed, monetary policy has been dictated by the philosophy of deficit spending throughout the 20th and now into the 21st century.So if you want someone to blame for the condition of your TP, blame Keynes.Now in all seriousness the mess we are in can't be blamed on one single person. And the blame game is pretty much pointless really. But there *are* lessons to be learned here, and in wrapping up this review I would like to mention two of them please.Lesson #1Keynes's theory of economics was not uncontested. There was another major economic theory being put forth at the same time Keynes was promoting government intervention to get past the depression. An Austrian economics professor named Freidrich Hayek espoused the opposite of what Keynes was pushing. He basically claimed that government intervention would backfire and that the economy should be left to heal on its own.Wow. Can you see why Keynes won the debate? Mind that I'm not asking who was right or wrong in their economic theory. We are not qualified to judge, no matter how many Holiday Inns we stay at. Rather, just imagine a time in this country when people were hungry and out of work. And imagine the government saying it wasn't going to lift a finger to help. Oh, did you think I was talking about the 1930s? No, I meant 2008. You see, even if Hayek was/is right, it was/is politically unfeasible to employ his ""do no harm"" approach. People won't stand for the government doing nothing (even if nothing is better than something) any more than they will tolerate TP that leaves dingles.Lesson #2The TP dilemma, with all the shenanigans about shrinking the rolls, degrading the quality, and such as and so forth, is actually a touch point for the less obvious ramifications of monetary inflation. It's not just about rising prices. And it's not just about smaller quantities. Inflation has been described as a force that leads to moral decay. It changes people's behavior. It forces us to cheat. In our little TP example we see that raising prices is not enough, nor is shrinking roll size. Companies get creative... they reduce quality, they emboss their sheets to fluff them up, they employ deceptive advertising, they hire professional liars like the company shills who troll Amazon reviews to make us believe that yes, although the rolls are smaller the quality is still the same, in spite of direct evidence to the contrary.The moral problem of inflation goes FAR beyond that however. It effects literally everything. No time here for piles of examples so let's just cut to the end game. In the end, inflation kills the underlining currency. We've seen hyperinflation kill currencies in Germany, Zimbabwe, Argentina, and in at least two dozen other countries over the past century. Those following the financial news may be aware that there is a worldwide movement taking place right now to drop the US dollar in world trade. Country after country is making trade agreements specifically designed to bypass the dollar and trade either in direct commodity exchange or in the country's native currency. The only thing that has allowed Keynesian economics to survive in America as long as it has is that the US dollar is used throughout the world as the currency of choice. But in eroding the value of the dollar we have eroded the world's confidence in the dollar. With a currency not backed by a commodity such as gold, CONFIDENCE is the only thing propping it up. If confidence evaporates we may well see prices (TP and everything) go to levels that will make all previous inflation since the depression pale in comparison.Yes, I'm saying that if unchecked spending is not curtailed we can expect dollar bills may soon be cheaper than sheets of TP when it comes time to do our dooty.-----PS - If you've ever camped in a National Forest campground and experienced the TP in those restrooms, everything after that feels like silk. Problems are relative. Enjoy the good life while it's here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31UZ6BU6NWYTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EIY0F6#wasThisHelpful","R31UZ6BU6NWYTI","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know it's been a million years and thousands of reviews later, but something has always mystified me about this movie. It's something that Trinity says to Neo in the subway station. She says she wants to tell him something, but she is afraid of what will happen if she does. The movie never made it clear what she was talking about! I went to every matrix forum I could find and the question is raised many times... but never fully addressed. Here is my attempt to answer the question once and for all. :>-------------In the first Matrix film, after Neo saved Trinity from the helicopter crash, the pair were in the subway station waiting for the phone to ring in order for Trinity could jack-out. Just before Agent Smith appears Trinity says to Neo: ""Neo, I want to tell you something, but I'm afraid of what it will mean if I do. Everything the Oracle told me has come true...everything but this."" She hesitates, and then Smith shows up to kill them and interrupts her.What did Trinity mean? What had the Oracle told her? Why was she scared to tell Neo? The film never made this clear.A common explanation is that Trinity was afraid to tell Neo she was in love with him. This does not wash however. In her phrasing, Trinity distinguished what had already come true (""has come true"") from what had not yet to come true. Clearly at this point in the film she was in love with Neo. He had just bravely risked his own life to save hers, and in fact she is hinted at being in love with him, as well as knowing he was The One before they even awoke him. So there is something else, something that has not yet happened, that makes her allude to ""everything but this"", with ""this"" being a reference to something she was about to tell Neo that had not yet come to pass.A twist on the above premise is that Trinity was scared to admit she was in love with Neo because she had been told he was not The One. But this explanation comes from people who are not recalling the timeline properly. The reveal regarding Neo having been told by the Oracle he was not The One came much later when he and Trinity were about to re-enter the Matrix to save Morpheus (also recall that Trinity was unaware the Oracle had told Neo that either he or Morpheus was going to die. This will be important later in this discussion). Furthermore we know at this point in the film that Morpheus and Trinity recognize Neo as The One. We have Morpheus just a few minutes before the subway scene announcing ""He is The One"" (from a rooftop no less) right after Neo saves Trinity from the crash. So neither explanation fits.Now we get to the explanation people have floated that makes the most sense. Only thing is, this line of reasoning has a giant rip in it, and this is what bakes everyone's noodle. First the explanation:Trinity thought Neo was going to die! That was what she was afraid to speak of. Neo's death was one of the things the Oracle had apparently told her, and that's why Trinity was holding back. It's why she had said ""I want to tell you something, but I'm afraid of what it will mean if I do"". A reasonable fear. How would the recently awakened Neo react to such news? Trinity also has to rectify the idea of Neo dying juxtaposed to the claim that he was The One. On this last point we have Cypher's later interjection when he is awake in the Nebuchadnezzar and about to unplug Neo: ""I mean how can he be the One if he's dead?"". Trinity is in love with the man she believes to be The One, so how can it be that he is due to die? (We later learn how this could be, but Trinity does not understand at this point).So Trinity is in dilemmaville throughout the story... until near the end when she is standing over a ""dead"" Neo. It is at this moment she gets it. In an act of faith --and a nice twist on the `Princess kisses the frog' fable-- she kisses Neo and he awakens. She verbalizes her faith just before kissing him with the line: ""Neo, I'm not afraid anymore. The Oracle told me that I would fall in love with a dead man. And that man, the man that I loved would be the One. So you see, you can't be dead. You can't be, because I love you. You hear me? I love you.""So there we go. We now know what the Oracle told Trinity, and we now understand what ""everything but this"" means. We can now desist in having our noodles baked.Except for one thing. The above words are not what Trinity spoke to Neo. And herein lies our giant hole. It appears that Trinity's actual lines were: ""Neo, I'm not afraid anymore. The Oracle told me that I would fall in love with a man. And that man, the man that I loved would be the One. So you see, you can't be dead. You can't be, because I love you. You hear me? I love you.""There's nothing in that dialog about her being told she would fall for a dead man! This has been heavily debated in the online forums, with people going back to watch the movie, turning on the sub-titles, looking over published copies of the script, and even lip reading Trinity's lines! When tallied up, the consensus is that Trinity says nothing of the Oracle telling her that Neo would die.So, this explanation too is rendered invalid, yes? No. Not on your life. Neo dying is precisely what Trinity had been afraid of. OK, then why does the dialog not support this assertion? Answer, I think they made a mistake in the film. The film makers at one point have Trinity seemingly knowing from the Oracle that Neo would die (we've eliminated the other theories), yet at another point she fails to verify this notion at the crucial moment where she reveals what the Oracle said. It's basically poor exposition, and I think this assertion can be proved.Keep in mind that there are several such ""mistakes"" in the film. One example is when Morpheus's team is trying to escape from the safe house after it is compromised by agents. Cypher trips, falls, then we don't see him for a while, until suddenly he shows up in the street making a call to jack-out, a fresh accident scene in the background. WTF? How did Cypher get there? How did he break away from the team trapped in the basement of the house? How did the accident occur? What was he doing in the vehicle? I used to puzzle over that each time I viewed the film. One could certainly extrapolate that a plan was in place to safely extract Cypher from the others so that he could live on and receive his reward while everyone else died. The traffic accident could have been staged by the agents to allow Cypher to escape from police custody. But there is no exposition making this connection. I learned years later that the scene I just described as missing was in fact filmed, but had been cut from the release version. There are a number of other incongruities throughout the film (we of course forgive the brothers because The Matrix is effectively a perfect movie).Likewise we are forced to extrapolate with this Trinity thing. She must have been told Neo would die. By process of elimination it's the only explanation that fits. And it fits oh so well. Bear in mind how integral to the film Neo's death was. One of the fundamental spiritual metaphors the Wachowski Brothers employed was the resurrection of Jesus. Think about the exchange between Neo and Choi early in the film:Choi: It's Choi.Neo: Yeah. Yeah. You're two hours late.Choi: I know, it's her fault.Neo: You got the money?Choi: Two grand.Neo: Hold on.Choi: Hallelujah. You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.Neo is the savior. He is the liberator of the lost souls of the Matrix. But to fulfill his destiny he must die. He must die in the matrix, and then transcend the matrix to be born again into a higher plane of existence. Neo's death and rebirth is the essence of the film. And the Oracle had to inform Trinity of this to prepare her for how to react when she faces a dead Neo. Don't forget that the Oracle was known for telling people what they needed to hear. Imagine Trinity's reaction after Smith shoots Neo if she had not been clued in that he would die. She may well have lost faith at that moment (just as Morpheus lost faith at the end of the second movie).So the fact that the film makers did not close the loop in Trinity's dialog is trivial. The movie is screaming what she knows. At the finale she states she is ""not afraid anymore"". She gazes upon the dead man she loves who is The One, and there is only one thing to do... she takes that leap of faith. She kisses the frog --the `dead' man who does not appear to be The One, but in fact is. Trinity knows this. She's been forewarned.And so Neo rises from the dead and the prophecy is fulfilled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P4HYOQK9OPYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HAB4KS#wasThisHelpful","R2P4HYOQK9OPYZ","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This documentary is absolutely positively must viewing for anyone ingesting fluoridated products. Unfortunately this does NOT just mean using a fluoride toothpaste or living in a locale where the tap water is fluoridated. Fluoride is added to a variety of commercial water and drink products, including water targeted to infants.According to this documentary, fluoridation began when the founder of Alcoa Aluminum was able to influence the government that an industrial byproduct of creating aluminum should be added to America's water supply. Fluoride was later derived from the waste formed when creating phosphorus based fertilizer. When that source was terminated in America, fluoride was then imported from China. And apparently the Chinese product labeled ""fluoride"" is not 'your father's' fluoride. Modern fluoride is apparently a composite of a variety of molecules, including heavy metals.The documentary attempts to illustrate that there was never any solid science behind the assertion that fluoride is safe for humans, let alone that it prevents tooth decay. Rather, the film makers point out fluoride is an industrial poison responsible for a wide variety of serious health problems, up to and including death.In my view though this film is an imperfect treatment of the subject. For one thing the film makers could have done a better job of outlining how dentists and other health care professionals came to believe that fluoride is safe and beneficial. The assertion is made that fluoride does nothing to help prevent tooth decay, yet no explanation is given as to why the first generation that grew up with fluoridated products have far less incident of requiring dentures than their parents. Rather, most of the effort is on pointing out the dangers of fluoride. You can pick out that the film makers went into the project with a strong belief that fluoride is extremely dangerous to human health, and the documentary is thus a bit biased. The film has been edited in such a way to continuously reinforce the point of view that fluoride is bad, including editing out portions of interviews that have the effect of putting words into the interviewee's mouth in such a way as to support the basic thesis of the documentary.At one point the film makers purchase a handheld device that measures the amount of fluoride in a sample. But rather than testing first a pure water sample (which should read 0 fluoride) and then a sample that they add fluoride to, on camera, they simply test a bottle of fluoridated baby water and show us the reading on the tester. THAT IS NOT SCIENCE. The film makers do provide some science to make their case, but that is offset by spurious anecdotal and/or subjective evidence, often provided by [well intended] lay people.This is unfortunate because fluoridated water does appear to be harmful. In some cases extremely harmful. As I picked my way through the film it became apparent that fluoride, especially today's ""fluoride"" is not a substance you want to put in your body.So despite its flaws, I highly recommend you view this documentary. You really need to hear the stories of the people who worked with this chemical and the devastating impact modern ""fluoride"" has had on their health. (Hint: the chemical eats through concrete and metal). In spite of the film being a bit light on science and a bit heavy oratory, there is a real wake-up call here. I ended up feeling gratified that I live in a place where the tap water is not fluoridated. I will never let a drop of fluoridated water pass my lips again, nor ingest a product infused with fluoride (such as toothpaste) in this lifetime.Final thought: Near the end of the film they mention a number of remedies to remove the poisons left by modern ""fluoride"". As someone who has gone through the process of removing heavy metals from my body I can tell you that the remedies they list ring true.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29H0NER9XZAC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJ1KUN0#wasThisHelpful","R29H0NER9XZAC0","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Despite appearances, this review contains no real spoilers.This movie may at first appear to be a turkey, but stick with it. I don't even know how the DVD ended up in my Netflix queue. I like James Garner (Wyatt Earp in Hour of the Gun and Jim Rockford in The Rockford Files), but not enough to pull down his entire filmology. But there it was in my mailbox so I fired it up. I nearly stopped the movie twice during the first 20 minutes or so. Initially the film gives off the scent of a poor attempt at being a light hearted war comedy.But the root dialog, once they get to it, catapults well over the top of the outdated opening (with James Garner's character giving every Navy Wave who comes in range a pat on the behind).The fanny patting stops however when Garner tries it out on prim, proper, fresh faced Julie Andrews (Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music), who plays Emily. She slaps his face good, and the movie upshifts a gear, but we're still not there. We first need to be exposed to what appears to be the Garner character's main claim to fame. He plays a procurement expert for a Navy admiral. He's good at obtaining things you're not supposed to be able to obtain during war, especially WWII England. You're not sure if his character will be similar to Jon Voight's highly enterprising 1st Lt. Milo Minderbinder in 'Catch 22'... or perhaps the more conservative obtainer of the unobtainable, Ensign Pulver in John Ford's classic 'Mr. Roberts'... or maybe the unabashed and hilarious 'Crap game' character in 'Kelly's Hero's', played by comedian Don Rickles. But it soon doesn't matter because Garner's real mettle, which comes out in a conversation with his newly acquired girlfriend's mother (the girlfriend being Julie Andrews), which reveals the character is about far more than then acquiring fine liquor, French perfume, and gourmet steaks (and fanny patting).Watch the movie up to the conversation Garner has with Julie Andrews's mother. That is where this film actually begins. Then you will know if the movie is worth your time. All the little spoilers I've been giving you up till now in fact spoil nothing, because, again, the movie begins here.

"The one thing I've noticed about Dell hardware is that it usually outlives the software. Our older Optiplex was humming along just fine, but Dell did not release any of the required hardware drivers (to drive the network card, video display, etc.) for an OS other than WINXP, so we had to upgrade. But out of the several dozen Dell laptops, desktops, and servers I've touched over the years, nary a one has had a hardware failure other then the odd hard drive failure from time to time. Dell hardware -especially the business class Optiplex line- is essentially bullet-proof.The refurbished market however adds a layer of variables to the purchase of a used computer, albeit Dell or any other maker. I was therefore delighted to receive this computer from CORETEK and find that it surpassed my [somewhat tempered] expectations. The computer was packed and shipped in a professional manner similar to how a new Dell arrives from the factory. Custom sized box and foam retainer fit the computer perfectly. Each component packaged individually (computer, keyboard, mouse, power cord). Clear and concise documentation regarding the specifics of the refurbished aspect of the unit, with a printed product key for Windows 7 HOME (with a 90 day support warranty), and -surprise surprise surprise- (that's my Gomer Pyle imitation) an actual Windows DVD.

"This product is actually sold for less $$ on the actual zmax website. As of this writing (Feb 17th, 2014) the single treatment lists here for $15.31 + $9.99 shipping. You can make the same purchase on the zmax site for a few dollars less. And, for $3.00 more you can get the entire 4 part kit on the same site. Be sure to click on specials to obtain the free shipping discount code. (HINT: The bottle of Small Engine Forumla can be used in your car engine. It's the same stuff as the engine treatment. So the kit is an even better deal).Now for two amazing zmax stories:Story #1: I had just bought a Honda Accord with 110K and an automatic transmission. Upon taking it on the freeway I noticed a problem with the tranny that I hadn't picked up on while test driving the vehicle (darn it). Once the car hit about 60MPH the overdrive cut in (effectively a 4th gear). But the moment I backed off on the accelerator the overdrive would instantly disengage, then re-engage a moment later. The effect was quite jarring and happened every time.Out of desperation I bought a bottle of the zmax transmission treatment and added it to the car (I had seen the old commercials on TV where they drive a car treated with zmax hundreds of miles with no oil in the pan). Within a couple of days of adding the treatment the bucking of the overdrive cutting out and in had completely stopped, and NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN AS LONG AS I OWNED THE CAR.Story #2. This one's even better. I had a Toyota Corolla, again with the automatic transmission. Out of the blue the tranny started making a noise. A loud noise. It happened mostly while backing up (gear shifter in reverse). It was a terrible scraping noise that sounded like metal on metal, like two garbage can lids being rubbed together. Again, out of sheer desperation, I bought a bottle of the zmax tranny treatment and poured it in (and no, the transmission was a tad low, but not empty of fluid). I swear, the sound stopped and HAS NEVER RETURNED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R5I51HV99521/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002T5ZGUS#wasThisHelpful","R2R5I51HV99521","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is going here? As of Feb 15th 2014 this product is listing for $129 and up. Huh? I bought mine last year for $14.95. This IS a $10-20 unit and is in NOW WAY worth a penny more. It does NOTHING other than play audio. No music controls, no hands free calling, nothing other than plug into a standard 3.5mm jack of any old digital music player that has one. There are dozens of FM xmitters that do what this thing does for $10-20. The vendors listing this item are either crazy, or, they think you are.I might also mention that the only reason I came to this page was because mine BROKE, and in fact has been failing intermittently for months. But not it failed completely and I am in the process of testing the warranty service of the distributor. Will report back with an update when they respond.UPDATE: I contacted the reseller who sold me my unit through Amazon, TripleNet Pricing, and they flat out refused to help with warranty service, not even providing me the manufacturer's contact information. I then googled the manufacturer, Coby Electronics Corporation, and found they went out of business late last year. They were reportedly bought by 'Gordon Brothers', who is not honoring the warranties. So now what is on sale is a questionable product, at a ridiculously high price, with a questionable warranty.

"I just went through four backlit keyboards trying to find one that that is actually usable. The first Three failed miserably, but this Logitech keyboard really fits the bill. Bright white backlight, ez to press keys with a fluid yet certain stroke, firm base, thin yet sturdy. Really one of the better keyboards I've ever used, backlight or no backlight. This keyboard comes in both wired and wireless versions as well. I personally prefer the wired version simply because it's just that much less RF in the living area.Having said that however, there are a few flaws in the design of this keyboard that belie the ""logic"" intimated by the manufacturer's name. Here are some thoughts on How Logitech could could achieve 5 stars for this keyboard:1) Take a look in the closeup photo of [what should be] the six keys above the arrow keys (INS, DEL, HOME, END, PgUp, PgDn). But wait, there are only five keys. The INS key is missing! It has been moved way up top to the function key row, ostensibly replacing the SCROLL LOCK key. Now it's OK to dump SCROLL LOCK (I personally have never used it except by mistake), but why did they move the oft used INS key? Longtime keyboarders are used to a six key grouping in a stacked two row arrangement. This is going to really mess up touch typists, but also if you look at the keyboard to type, then when you need one of those key you instinctively look for the GROUPING PATTERN as much as the text on the keys. Since the DEL key on this keyboard is now a single long key that spans both rows I found that when seeking DEL my hand instinctively went to the lower key on the stacked set... which is the END key. Totally through me off and now I must train my mind (if you have ever been asked for a phone number that you know but can't recall until you walk over to a phone and mimic the dialing pattern you know what I mean). Why? Why did you do this Logitech? To add to the confusion, the lettering on the DEL key is near the top rather than centered... and it is the lettering that is lit up, so at night when relaying on mainly the backlighting to type, the DEL looks even more out of place. I might point out that the wireless version of this model, which seems nearly identical to the wired version, maintains the traditional six key pattern. What was the wired design team smokin'?2) Another flaw in this otherwise awesome keyboard is the lighting of the function keys. If you look at the photo you will notice that the F1-F12 keys are now *alternate function* keys, meaning you must press the FN key in tandem with a function key to get the legacy function such as F1 for Help (although thankfully when accessing the thesaurus in MS Word SHIFT+F7 still works).Perhaps this is a reasonable move to people who don't use the traditional function keys much, and instead prefer the new primary functions Logitech has assigned to those 12 keys, such as start a program like mail or music. I tied to adapt to the Logitech paradigm, but the first time I went to send an email and hit the email key (what used to be F2) instead of sensing that my email program was already running (Outlook) and open up a new send mail window in the foreground, the key instead triggered a second instance of Outlook to open. Not all that helpful.One other drawback to this new F key layout is that if you go to use the legacy functions keys in dim light, the F1-F12 labels that are now on the front portion of the keys are not backlit. Hello?! Logitech? This is why we bought the keyboard.... to see the keys in the dark! Neither are the labels on the PRINT SCREEN and PAUSE keys lit, instead, just the funny looking (and too small to make sense) symbols next to the label. The symbols are lit, but not the text right next to them that we've been using to identify those key as long as we've been keyboarding. Again.... what were the designers thinking? Why not just light up the whole key?3) The cord. What happened here? Here you have this beautiful, smooth, silky, feels-just-right keyboard, and attached to it is the scrawniest, stiffest USB cord I have ever born witness to. It is so stiff it tends to remain in whatever coiled, twisted, kinked position it has worked its way into, rather than smoothly and naturally unkinking itself when stretched out. The cord is like the anti-matter opposite of the keyboard itself. It's convincing evidence that wherever there is good... it's evil twin opposite naturally arises (a.k.a. Data and Lore). This seems to be a fundamental law of the cosmos, so maybe the design team is not to blame here.4) Finally, the ""programability"" of the keyboard is weak. Logitech provides its SetPoint software that allows the user to reprogram certain keys. Great, except the software seems needlessly limited. The first thing I wanted to do was assign a string of characters I type often (my full name) to a function key. Can't do it. You can only assign a single letter to a key. To achieve the capability I assumed was there -known as a macro- you must install a 3rd party utility... and hope it's compatible with your version of Windows. It would be great to see Logitech add the ability to assign a string of characters to a single key.----------------------For your reference the three keyboards that did not pass muster:1) AULA wired gaming keyboard (AULA BE FIRE 3 Colors LED Backlit Expert Gaming Wired Keyboard). Even though it is a full sized keyboard the keys themselves are smaller than normal. Moreover, instead of stenciling the key labels on dual function keys in top/bottom arrangement (""@"" symbol above the ""2"") they placed the labels side-by-side which is just plain BIZARRE. The action on the keys was nowhere near this Logitech unit. Furthermore, instead of backlighting just the keys, the entire base of keyboard is unnecessarily lit up. Rather distracting.2)(Impecca KBL200 Slim Illuminated Keyboard - Large Font - Bright LED Backlit Keys). This keyboard has very large easy to read keys, and in fact would be a good choice for someone actually vision impaired. The tradeoff however is the terrible feel to the keys. A bit sticky. No fluid action at all. I had many missed keystrokes. This keyboard is not even in the same ballpark as the Logitech.3) I also found a backlit keyboard on eBay that was quite promising (search eBay: KBA-TG82R-BTURUS Backlit Sealed Surface Keyboard w/ Touchpad). This is a compact keyboard, with the keypad removed to reduce its size. The action on this keyboard at first seems GREAT. The whole keyboard is coated with a rubbery material that has a very solid feel to it. The Achilles heel with the unit however is that it takes an unusual amount of pressure to actuate a key. There is a pleasant and reassuring click of sorts when you make a letter, but you have to mentally focus on being sure you press hard enough to make that letter. Worse, the space bar only has actuators on each end, but none in the middle. So you have to press extra hard to make a space if your finger happens to land in the middle of the space bar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXQVPNOJQ3WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F51G16#wasThisHelpful","RFXQVPNOJQ3WF","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I was perusing these reviews to ascertain if this show was worth the time, I saw someone had said that 'The Duchess of Duke Street' was every bit as good a Downton Abbey and Upstairs/Downstairs. To me the gulf between Downton and Upstairs could be measured in miles so I dismissed the review. Downton is a rare gem that occurs only when story, acting, direction, set/production, and all those other ineffable, hard to quantify qualities come together to make *magic*. That series stands alone. I had just come down from watching first Downton and then the good but not great current rendition of Upstairs when it was time to consider this series.Wow. Magic! It's here. But, it's a different kind of magic. With Downton the magic is apparent in the very first episode. Not necessarily so with Duchess. It takes a while for this series to show its stuff, but the ride is absolutely worthwhile. The lead character Mrs. Trotter (the Duchess), is a bit harsh and abrasive. They did not draw her as likeable (which is actually refreshing). I have no idea what the real person Mrs. Trotter was based on was like, but if you suppress any reflexive urge to turn the show off because of Trotter's demeanor you will be rewarded with a rich and varied tale that winds it way through the events leading up to, during, and after WWI.In fact, I would venture to say that Duchess at the very least rivaled, if not surpassed, conveying the devastating effect the war had on Britain. Regardless, the breadth and depth of this series as a whole is nearly unparalleled. An array of writers produced a far flung, eclectic set of stories such that you never know what's coming next. You are taken here, there, and everywhere as the life and times of Mrs. Trotter - and the people in her life- unfold for your viewing pleasure. By the end of the series you are in love with all the characters (I particularly loved the head waiter) and truly sorry to see it all end. I cried. I am a man, and I cried. More than once.

It makes you think as well as emote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XVXMBWWESAWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QJA9AO#wasThisHelpful","R1XVXMBWWESAWQ","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There used to be a TV show called ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000', where a human and an assortment of mechanized miscreants would watch a really lame movie and crack jokes throughout, talking over the dialog. It was one of the best shows around, so naturally they took it off the air. The show was at its best when poking fun at films with highly implausible plots and silly dialog. Throw in a few models/actresses attempting to impersonate tough policemen and you had a theme the MST3K gang could really work with. Regrettably, MST3K is gone for good, so fodder such as 'The Last Stand' cannot be serviced properly.

"Hello?! Did I hear another reviewer say ""ok, but nothing amazing.""? Wow. I would like to taste the cookies that person thinks are amazing, because these oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are the THE BEST cookies I've ever tasted in my ENTIRE LIFE. They're the best ever. It's not Mrs. Fields folks, nor Toll House, nor even the fresh baked -and sometimes even warm- chocolate chip cookies sitting in the lobby of Doubletree hotels. Nooooooooo. No, Uncle Eddie cookies are bar-none the best cookies in the known universe. They rule over all other cookies.I have it on good authority that The Cookie Monster loves these cookies best!!!When I dream, I dream in *UncleEddieVision*. (copyright 2014)If I was trapped on a desert island and could only bring minimal food stuffs... these babies would be on the list. Bart Simpson used to claim that Butterfingers were a major food group. Wrong! It's these puppies! They are too die for! You can't live without them. They're death cookies.And speaking of that, if I *was* on my death bed and my family asked me if I had any last wishes, I would beg for a case of these cookies.If I committed a capitol crime (physically impossible for anyone on Uncle Eddie's cookies), and was sent to the chair... for my last meal I would request to dine exclusively on these goby gooey treats.Conversely, if you die and have to spend some time in Purgatory, I hear they serve Uncle Eddie's cookies in the waiting room. So what's to worry? Well, you do want to avoid dropping down into that 'other place' ... they actually serve these cookies there as well, but they have no taste. True damnation.Uncle Eddie's cookies should be standard issue in the army, on ambulances, and on St. Bernard rescue kits. All airline and hospital food should be jettisoned in favor of these cookies. If I was President I would make Uncle Eddie's the National Cookie. The world would be a better place.If I was given the choice between eating one single Uncle Eddie's Vegan Oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, or going on a date with the most beautiful woman in the world... I'd take the woman.

"After trying out a number of super low-cost LED based solar lights listed on Amazon -all of which originate from China- I came to the conclusion that virtually every device I purchased is on the one hand useful and workable, while on the other hand is very cheaply made. Very simple designs... very low cost components... mass produced with minimal QC. The result is a light that basically does work but has high failure rates. That's the business model, and we consumers help drive that model with our bargain hunting sensors always on full alert.One of the two lights I ordered one failed almost immediately, thus a 50% failure rate. But that was easy to remedy thanks to Amazon's liberal return policies. And it was worth the trouble because these really are great lights. I might note that depending upon the supplier (and quite probably other factors) you may receive one of at least two different versions of this light fixture. One version is as pictured, with an opaque, protruding dome cover, and another model that has a flat, transparent cover that exposes the LEDs (you can actually see the little LEDs making up the array. I much prefer the latter model, both because it's just cooler looking, as well the fact that the one that died was the former design.I tried to post a couple of customers images to show you the different styles, as well as the innards, but can't seem to do so for this product. Finally, for anyone finding that the light does not stay on in dim mode all night you can replace the stock battery with a higher capacity battery. The unit comes with a 4.5 volt battery, so I used three AAA replacements installed into one of these inexpensive carriers (2Pcs Spring Clip 3 x 1.5V AAA Battery Holder Case Box Wire). The carrier just fits in the enclosure. Unlike many of the solar lights I've been trying out, the battery in this unit is not technically replaceable (it does not plug in to a socket), but the leads are long enough that anyone handy with a wire cutter/stripper can swap in the replacement carrier ez-pz (no soldering required). The light must of course receive enough sunlight to charge the higher capacity battery set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18UZAAE96IH33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BZ0IR2#wasThisHelpful","R18UZAAE96IH33","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Whilst scanning Amazon for a USB CD/DVD writer, I spotted an ASUS unit -a well established and highly reputable brand- and the price and review ratings were good, so I bought it.

"Keep you refund trigger finger warmed up when you order these. My first set (as others have reported) were DOA. Amazon of course made the return painless and costless. The second set flickered on/off now and then the first couple of days, but since have been working fine for the last few weeks. I took the control box apart, and the circuity driving these lights is rather laughable. A tiny unsecured circuit board kind of flopping around inside.But the thing about these lights is that they are Cool with a capital C. They're fun. They stretch out 20 feet to slightly illuminate the surroundings with multi-colored LED lights shining through likewise multi-colored Chinese lanterns (the quality is actually decent on the lantern hardware. It's an appealing presence and they kind of make you happy as they glow merrily through the evening.I would not be concerned about the reviews commenting on the lights losing their longevity as time passes. It's really ez to pop in a replacement battery. I posted a photo that shows what it looks like inside the control box when you remove the four small phillips screws. The original 60mAh AA battery has been replaced with a $2 Tenergy 2600mAh rechargeable.

"This is a good book but I would like to pass on two caveats:1) Not everything you need to build a Windows networkThis is not a network administrators guide. I am setting up a Windows 8.1 / Windows Serer 2012 network from scratch, with only a Windows XP / Windows NT server background. This book does not cover all that's needed (and with the possible exception of the title it doesn't really pretend to). For example, the phrase ""roaming profile"" a staple technology for the user experience end of things, is not even listed in the index, whereas in Mark Minasi's 'Mastering Windows Server 2012 R2' the index lists 1/3 of a column for that term.2) Needs additional examplesGiven that I am building only a single server network, much of the book's material regarding Server 2112 was superfluous. However the passages I did read, while on the one hand included thorough explanations of a feature or technology, I often noted that they went no further. The book is a bit 'sterile', meaning, I would often read the section about a particular feature, and then wished the author had drilled down more. I was understanding the principals involved, but did not have 'context'. There were few real-world examples or workarounds. Passages are lacking tips about fitting the discussed piece into a larger context. I don't recall reading any 'from-the-trenches' anecdotes. For example, I wanted to choose the best approach for architecting storage on the server, but after reading the entire storage section, including one or two conflicting statements, I still wasn't sure of the best approach for my situation. But I would again stress that I did not read the book cover to cover, and am speaking only of the few chapters I did read.Having said that, clearly this is a highly regarded book and I am happy to include it in my reference library.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5WVBBK48MDK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0735666318#wasThisHelpful","R5WVBBK48MDK3","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best way to view this film is to go into it knowing as little as possible about the story. Fortunately, most of the descriptions I read about the movie before seeing it were inaccurate... thus the rather surprise ending was just that... a surprise. As it should be.Director Martin Ritt holds court on how to properly unfold a such story whose plot is based on ""plans within plans"". This is a movie that needs to be payed attention to in order to be *fully* appreciated. But if you don't there are still rewards in taking in the dank, black & white, otherworldly images that weld themselves to your consciousness. This film works on several levels, with timeless themes that make the ride worthwhile. Tip: Watch Richard Burton closely. His manner. His facial expressions. He is a master actor whose every move informs. Just don't assume he knows the whole story.One thing that can be revealed without incurring spoilage is that we run into 'George Smiley' in this film. Wasn't Smiley a character animated by Alec Guinness in the popular spy film 'Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy' and the 'Smiley's People' series? Why yes... the novels all these teleplays were based on were written by John le Carr√©.

"There are very few too-good-to-be-true things in life that in fact do turn out to be true. But this is one of those products. I have only used this product for one day, yet I am reviewing it due to the dramatic overnight results.I had a severe respiration problem that was getting progressively worse lately. Almost any toxin/allergen in the air puts me on my back starving for oxygen. I actually had to phone 911 a few weeks ago to get some oxygen when a few wisps of smoke from a distant forest fire wafted into my neighborhood. Contemporary medicine has provided no solutions. The few days leading up to trying Miracle II Neutralizer were the worst yet, and I was running out of options. Then a friend showed up at my doorstep with a gallon sized container of this product. To make a long story short I started drinking 6oz of the liquid every 4 hours. When I awoke the following morning I was breathing near normal. By that evening respiration was completely normal. Needless to say, this product's name is not exaggerated.Testing* later revealed that this is indeed a highly concentrated product and is actually as unbelievably inexpensive as it is unbelievably effective. My health practitioner determined that merely 4 drops of the solution in 6oz of tap water is equivalent to taking a straight 6oz of the product.Also, be reminded that the FDA places severe restrictions on what makers of products such as these can claim about their efficacy. Thankfully forums such as Amazon reviews tell what the manufacturer of Miracle II cannot. And now I've told you my story. In an age of a population with decaying health, and a medical industry co-opted by the pharmaceutical industry, citizens need to inform each other in such forums as these that there are indeed alternatives to expensive (and harmful) prescription pills and operations.* I use Applied Kinesiology for determining efficacy of food and supplements.

"Just before ordering these 1/8"" rope winches I had taken delivery on a 1/4"" rope ratchet that was a different brand (Carolina North 10010 1/4"" Rope Ratchet with 8' Solid Braided Polypropylene Rope, 150 lbs Capacity). The 1/4"" ratchet from Carolina North is very impressive for its cost, and I would rate quality as Good to Very Good. By comparison, I would rate these 1/8"" ratchet as ""Fair"" quality. They work, but next time I would definitely buy the other brand (the 1/8"" version of the Carolina North brand was not available on Amazon at time of purchase).A little more detail: There is a note on the packaging of this item that it has been ""improved"" by upgrading the ratchet wheel from plastic to metal. It was hard to tell, but I *will* say that the action of this ratchet (ratcheting the load / releasing the tension) feels a bit ""cheap"", whereas the Carolina North item had a nice smooth feel. I am using this item for a slightly more rigorous purpose than hanging grow lights, but I wouldn't doubt that this ratchet is up to the job of holding lights up. But if you appreciate a better quality solution I think the Carolina North brand is a better product (assuming their 1/8"" version is of similar quality to the 1/4"" item I bought).Either way, Happy Growing!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BXSNEQPGF1GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098R0600#wasThisHelpful","R1BXSNEQPGF1GG","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took delivery of this 1/8"" rope along with a pair of 1/8"" rope ratchets (Apollo Horticulture GLRP18 Pair of 1/8"" Adjustable Grow Light Rope Rachet Hanger w/ Improved Metal Internal Gears). The rope included with the ratchets was of a notably higher quality than this rope, and gave me something to compare to. This rope under review frayed surprisingly easy when it was drawn across the edge of a rough cut 2X6. I just don't see it lasting so I returned it.Gotta love Amazon.

"High marks for this mini-winch...1) The guts are metal, not plastic.2) Four screws hold the mechanism together, so you can take it apart far enough to wash out any dirt and grime that build up around the wheel (a rivet at the pointy end keeps the spring loaded release from flying off into Netherland.3) The rope is high quality with a nice smooth feel. The ends are terminated in such a way to prevent fraying.4) The ratchet makes a really cool noise when you tighten your load down.To set it up, thread the rope into the ratchet from the bottom and then rotate the knurled wheel to make the rope pop out the other side (very reliable. It's not a thread through a needle sort of thing). Hook the ratchet to what you are tying down and then either tie the other end down with the far end of the rope directly or tie the additional hook to the rope end first. To cinch it tight just pull on the end of the rope you threaded through the ratchet. Note that there is no ""winch handle"" to cinch it tight. You are using the strength of your hand(s) pulling on the rope.A solution that allows for actually ratcheting rather than hand pulling on small jobs might be this handy little item: Ben-mor Cables Inc C78005V Mini Winch Clothesline Cable Tightener. I almost bought one of these for my application (cinching down a tarp cover on a deck), but it seems it would be a bit tedious tightening it down each time the tarp cover is put in use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X2P63HP3Z5NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006P3B4A6#wasThisHelpful","R1X2P63HP3Z5NU","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in the boonies and got fed up one day about not having the right glue or tape on hand. So I went on a buying spree and bought a wide variety of differing types of tapes and glues. So no more boo hoo when something comes loose.The plans are to someday write up a comprehensive comparison review on both product categories, but you know how plans go. In the meantime I find that I reach for this Fusion brand more often than anything else when the urge to glue come upon me. It does glue most anything together. And I like that it does not clog up the nozzle after sitting for a while. It's always handy and quick when you need it.The only thing I've learned to shy away from using it on is vertical surfaces. It's a bit runny and takes a while to set. So you get drips.

"This review is mainly for people who use/believe in energetically testing products through the use of Applied Kinesiology (muscle testing). This Nutrex spirulina tests very strong... even better than the NOW brand.I have been purchasing the NOW brand of spirulina for years because they make great supplements. Spirulina is not cheap though, so I decided to look for an alternative of equivalent quality. The only thing I found that's a lot cheaper than the NOW brand is the bulk packaged products from places like China. Although such products could be muscle tested for purity I decided to not even bother. I noticed that the Nutrex spirulina is a bit cheaper than the NOW brand, and I like the idea of sourcing from Hawaiian waters.Delightfully, the Nutrex spirulina tests a bit stronger than the NOW spirulina. Not a *huge* difference, but given that it is also cheaper I jumped ship to the Nutrex brand (about $5 cheaper on a 1lb. jar at time of this review 4-2013). As a plus, the Nutrex product comes in a dark GLASS jar compared to the plastic bottle used by Now.By the way... I've used applied kinesiology for 20+ years and trust it over any lab test. The key is to find a practitioner who knows how to do it properly. Muscle testing a nutritional product alleviates the nuisance of trying to evaluate claims by the manufacturer (organic or not, clean waters, properly processed, etc.). Muscle testing bypasses all that nonsense and simply measures how effective the product is. For example, we have tested various non-organic products that rated better than their organic counterparts. Organic labeling can [unfortunately] be misleading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY79H6SEBWPJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039ITKR4#wasThisHelpful","RY79H6SEBWPJ8","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (Alice in Wonderland). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.REVIEW OF THIS 1981-82 PRODUCTION OF ALICE IN WONDERLAND . . .It is interesting to see what non-English speaking cultures do with the British born story of Alice in Wonderland. Of the 40 plus Alice productions I've viewed to date, several come from ""foreign"" contributors in France, Japan, the Czech Republic, and Korea/Germany. Probably the number one reason I decided to try and watch every version of AIW in existence is because of how each production renders the book so uniquely. Each and every AIW version is a distinct rendering of someone's vision of how to convert Lewis Carroll's words into moving pictures.Nowhere is this uniqueness more apparent than the AIW offerings from other countries. And now we have a recent entry from Russia! It's actually a 1981 production that recently found its way onto Amazon. The jacket design is the first clue to the individuality of this production. In viewing it you might infer that this is a 'jokey' installation of AIW, a cartoon, and with imagery that is both unique and at the same time adorable.Right on all counts. The number one reason to buy this DVD is to enjoy the remarkable imagery employed in this animated telling of both `Alice in Wonderland' and `Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There'. The stories are [thankfully] told in two separate installments, with Looking Glass actually having been produced the following year in 1982. Anyway, I could try and describe this beautifully rendered Russian imagery, but just a glance at the Cheshire cat on the DVD cover tells the story. The entire cartoon reeks of this playful approach to bringing Lewis Carroll's characters to life.Obviously the animators were not concerned about taking a hint from John Tenniel's illustrations, so the next logical question is, how close does this cartoon follow the storyline and dialog of the book? This has actually become my key question as I unwrap each new Alice production that comes my way. Are we going to experience scrupulous enactments of each passage of the book (each of Alice's discrete adventures), related in the correct order, with no mixing of the two books? And are we going to hear Lewis Carroll's textual descriptions and dialog as written? No. This just doesn't happen. Every production departs from the book(s), it's just a question of degree.With this cartoon you get the ""standard deviation pattern"" of so many Alice installments whereby many, but never all, of the book's passages are rendered, combined with [at times] a strict verbalization of the original dialog which punctually veers off into adhoc, nothing-to-do-with-Carroll dialog. So, no, this is not the Holy Grail Alice production a purist may be wondering about. However, besides being a fun ride, the animators have incorporated some elements from the book you may have never seen before. For example, recall in the book when Alice is falling down the rabbit hole. She has this thought; ""I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!"" Well, the animators decided to actually illustrate people on the other side of the Earth walking upside down. Why has no once else ever thought to do this!?At another moment in the rabbit hole Alice thinks ""'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?'"". Well guess what. We get to see that thought played out in a visual form. We also get to see a visual of when Alice thinks of sending a pair of boots to her feet once a year, while super-sized in the Hall of Doors. These are the kinds of elements, along with the cool animation, that endeared this version of AIW to me.As mentioned, the DVD also includes `Through the Looking Glass...'. The same animators are at work here bringing us the same Russian inspired imagery. We see the Red and White King and Queen not clothed in their original `Michelin Man"" Tenniel style wardrobe, but rather Czar inspired Imperial layered costumes. We see a Jabberwock, not rendered as an evil monster, but rather a jokey cartoon figure. On the other hand we get a full reading of the Jabberwocky poem!Notes: The Amazon description states that subtitles are in English, German, and French, but on my DVD it is actually English, Russian, and French.---------------All the Alice reviews in this series are on Listmania:1) Click on my user name2) Click on 'Listmania!'3) Then click on See 'Entire List'.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36I77JLFM6HJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A8E01C#wasThisHelpful","R36I77JLFM6HJY","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As noted, this film borrows from Dark City, Blade Runner, Terminator, The Matrix, Fahrenheit 451, and Total Recall, but this movie falls far short of those greats. There is a difference between employing genre, plot, character, theme, and other such elements from past movies and rolling them in to a creative, inspired, and unique film experience, compared to such films as this which represent nothing more than simply stealing from the successful and not even attempting to cover your tracks.Christian Bale looks great in this film, but his beyond-Neo super-human antics have no basis for believability, whereas the Matrix properly set the plausibility stage for how one man could kill dozens. We saw the same implausible kind of ripoff with the Selina character in 'Dark Knight Rises' who performs Trinity-like moves with the same lack of foundation. They're hoping we won't notice, or care.Equilibrium is also full of the kind of plot twists and unexpected character behavior audiences tend to go for.... except, again, absolutely no set up for the twists, so it gets less and less easy to suspend your disbelief, while at the same time easier and easier to predict what's coming next as the movie drags on. By the end of the film you are fed up with the nonsensical sequences, you realize there's not a fresh piece of meat to be found in this turkey, and you start to regret the time you've invested. Save yourself the trouble and instead catch one of the aforementioned films you haven't seen yet! :>","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIGZXQIQT7F2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P7CNE0#wasThisHelpful","RIGZXQIQT7F2K","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although this is not a true story, I used to have a client who at one time fell into the clutches of a cult from this era (the 80s), and he stated that this film is dead on accurate. The client was deprogrammed out of the cult, then went to law school to become an attorney that sued such cults, and also helped to deprogram others.This film is brilliantly written, produced, cast, and acted. It plays like a documentary. You will actually feel like what's happening is absolutely real and someone just happened to have a video camera handy. What exactly is happening? You are witness to the events that unfold for a lost human being searching for the truth and being misled and waylaid by a ""Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon"" style religious cult. This was the notoriously corrupt cult that received so much alarming press in the 1980's, the same decade 'Ticket to Heaven' was made.Laid bare are the seductive techniques employed by a cult to draft new members. You are taken full cycle -from the victim's state of mind that opened the door to such a path, to his indoctrination into the cult, to his programming once membership was gained, and finally to his ""kidnapping"" by family and friends who then commence to deprogramming him.It is the incredible realism of this film that makes it so compelling. The actors involved -including the great Saul Rubinek, who turned in a memorable Star Trek Next Generation episode as a villain in 'The Most Toys' - must have had to wash off some emotional scars that undoubtedly accumulated during filming. This is an adult film.

"I just recently took delivery on this timer to replace an Ergo Systems timer purchased from Amazon that died in about a year. After poking around and seeing poor reviews for so many of these timers, I was relieved to find that this unit was better received. The quality and good engineering of this product showed immediately. The battery is already charged, so you can program the timer without having to plug it into an outlet (once you remove the slip of plastic that keeps the battery from being discharged while in transit).There is a simple and advanced programming mode, and unless you need to create a LOT of events the simple mode works great. I did need to refer to the manual for initial programming instructions (thus 4 stars), but the timer programmed properly, was then automatically active, and the first timer event worked. So, very pleased so far.UPDATE: In use for several months and all is well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWL69Z0P9P5UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040718V4#wasThisHelpful","RWL69Z0P9P5UD","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This splendid film is a John Wayne ""sleeper"" and a true classic. It is a rare Wayne movie where he plays a ""bad"" guy (but not really). Moreover, it is a western you can view with gals who would normally steer away from this genre. I wouldn't come right out and call it a chick-flick, but it does have feminine appeal. The lesson given is how does a Quaker family (who call themselves 'The Society of Friends') behave when the water is cut off to their ranch by a cranky neighbor. Taken in by this high minded family when he is wounded, Wayne's character finds a plaque on the wall of his bedroom that reads as follows:""Each human being has an integrity that can be hurtonly by the act of that same human beingand not by the act of another human being""Wayne is transformed upon witnessing how his Quaker hosts respond to the life threatening action taken by the neighbor. He is also touched by the angelic devotion shown to him by his pretty-as-can-be love interest Gail Russell. If you have seen all the great westerns and are now seeking then ones you may have overlooked, this is a great place to start.BTW - another Wayne western that is not played all that often is ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"". Great character driven plot. One of the few films where Wayne dies. And the ladies may favor this one as well. Violence only where it is required, a hard working family plays witness to the injustices inflicted upon western neophyte Jimmy Stewart, and there's a strong female lead for the lovely Vera Miles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPN80WUH6T63G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009NH89#wasThisHelpful","RPN80WUH6T63G","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had seen the 1990 British version of this political drama first. It was so good I was keeping my expectations tempered for fear of a watered down American version. But this US version is very well done. Brilliant even. Full of detail and nuance. Impeccable casting. Kevin Spacey is one of the smartest actors in Hollywood and the script is worthy of his talents. The same can be said of the entire cast. This is a very different story from its British counterpart though. Yes, it's about politics and greed and betrayal, but from a different angle juxtaposed to what the Brits did. Both series are top notch thrillers in their own unique way.House of Cards illustrates the seedy underbelly of politics. If you really want to get a sense of how politics corrupts, how people can rationalize their corrupt acts -including murder- and still sleep at night, here is a great teacher. You witness first hand the enormous pressure elected representatives face in order to go-along-to-get-along. You come to realize that reform from within is made architecturally impossible.While viewing this series I was watching Kevin Spacey's character (an influential congressman) look his friends/associates directly in the eye and tell the most sincere of lies without a blink of his own eye. All to benefit his own personal agenda. I was reminded of another series about people in positions of power that portrayed the exact same behavior... The Sopranos. So, we have gangsters and politicians rendered as amoral liars that are willing to kill to get what they want. These fictions of course could not possibly reflect real life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R9DUD38FEZUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BC5I6Q2#wasThisHelpful","R3R9DUD38FEZUP","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh come on. This film makes sense only if the story is explained to you. The cues for the dream passages are simply not articulated well. It's like the director didn't really care if you understand what's going on. And why is this girl even dreaming? Where are we going? Storywise there's no THERE there. The movie doesn't end, it simply stops. It's like the film broke mid-reel and both the audience and take-up reel are left spinning in perpetuity. Still, it's David Lynch, and there's wonderful film making -if not story telling- taking place.If you loved Twin Peaks you will likely love this film. If you were disappointed by the untidy loose ends of Twin Peaks... the pointless plot points, the surrealistic path that leads nowhere, and the unresolved elements of the last episode, then you may be equally disappointed in Mullholland Drive, which was initially devised as a TV pilot. The pilot was rejected, so Lynch tacked an ending on to it. What ending? What got resolved?David Lynch is a brilliant film maker, rendering unparalleled mood and intensity on the screen. But he has some internal compulsion that pushes him too far. He's creative enough to invent new metaphors, but he sticks with the old ones, as with the dwarf and the draped room (Mullholland Drive is arguably the opening episode for season 3 of Twin Peaks). Surrealism is great, but give it meaning David... even 'pretend' meaning. We want to go for the ride, but you never get us to the destination. That would be OK too if you would at least give us something to wrap our willingness to suspend-our-disbelief around. But there's just too many needless sub-mysteries and we lose interest.When the unsatisfactory ending to Mulholland Drive arrives you almost don't care because it's clear that the investment you've made in following the story turns out to be nothing more than mental masturbation. The film's got some great moments though, and still worth the view. Just temper your expectations. For me Lynch is at his best when someone hands him the story and he simply makes the movie. Dune was a masterpiece.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38AK7TPIKZHHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JKJA#wasThisHelpful","R38AK7TPIKZHHY","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first googled for a replacement spark plug cable set my eyes about popped out of my head at the prices. And then I found a link for this Bosch set with distributor cap on Amazon. Roughly half the price I had seen on most other sites. Remarkable that Amazon is becoming a go-to site for car parts now too. Delivery was quick, the order had the exact parts advertised (the Bosch part in a new Bosch box), and coupled with a rotor I also found on Amazon I had the whole rig installed on my Corolla in a few minutes. What's not to love?Note: I did not have the same experience as the reviewer who says you need to twist 90 degrees. My cable set had the cable permanently attached at the cap end, and the spark plug end simply needed to be pushed on as normal... and it did click into place. Do NOT twist 90 degrees.UPDATE: When I placed the order on March 5th 2013 the price was $26.49, plus $5.49 shipping. On March 16 the price now shows as $43.16 and super saver shipping.

"I had this particular kit kicking around for some time before putting it to use by lending it to a friend who had suffered a direct impact to her knee when falling. Several days after the injury she was still experiencing quite a lot of discomfort, but upon applying first the cream, and then later taking the sub-lingual pills, she experienced clear and direct relief from both forms of the Traumeel. It seemed by combining both the topical as well as the internal forms gave the most effective relief, as well as triggering of the healing process.Heel is a trusted name in our family for many years.

"After a bit of research this [very complete] kit turned up as having the best price for a branded timing belt / water pump replacement. I hadn't thought of changing the fan belts at the same time, and was happy to see them included. I had a mechanic do the job, and he reported no issues with fit or quality of the parts. Yeah!I might add that I pushed this job about 15,000 miles past the recommended 60K interval, yet the old belt was still in great condition (at least on visual check). The water pump impellers were also still in good shape. So yeah, I maybe could have pushed it even further, but I'm really really glad I did the job now because all the goofy little noises coming from the engine have stopped! The new serpentine belts helped, but the mechanic also said the old timing belt tensioner was the one part that was worn, and that it can get noisy when this happens.Kudos to the supplier who put this kit together.

"The three excellent reviews from  Brad Ackerman, R. Jensen, and zolof911 posted here at the time I stopped by tell the story of this product quite adequately.I wanted a ""pure"" power strip sans the extra cost of surge protection, as most outlet strips want to throw that in for market appeal. I wanted a strip that could not be easily turned off, as with so many other strips simply staring at them hard seems to flip the flimsy rocker switch. And I wanted to be able to plug in a large number of power bricks without having to resort to shorty extension cords.This unit does all that. Turning the AC outlets 90 degrees so that many/most bricks stick OUT in the air rather than DOWN over another outlet was a simple design choice, yet so few power strip designers have had this light bulb come on (hello!?).If they had placed the cord at the opposite end of the toggle switch we would be talkin' 5 stars here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R241VQYSJZHRMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000L4F5UK#wasThisHelpful","R241VQYSJZHRMI","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewer Publius is correct when saying: ""So in short, 1) Pull the spring trap back 2)Lay the hook all the way down on top of the spring 3)Slowly lift the cheese up just to the point it catches on the hook"".In fact, Victor is the only brand I know making this style trap that really does work. Smaller Mice can be very light on their feet, and clever, and you really do need a trap with a 'hair trigger'. You do need to set the trap so that the wire is barely under the tab on the cheese platform to achieve that hair trigger. Anyone who gets their finger bit by one of these traps (ouch!) is simply handling it incorrectly. If you don't want to get bit don't put you fingers in the line of fire!Recently Orchard Supply Hardware dropped the entire line of Victor traps for a lower cost brand called TomCat. The TomCat traps look exactly the same, but they can't be set with that all important hair trigger. Thus the mice at my place were getting a nice meal of peanut butter every night. I also tried one other brand when I couldn't get the victor and it too failed to spring.And yes, peanut butter works better than cheese on our brand of meeeces. But not that natural, wholesome style peanut butter that is a bit runny and needs to be mixed well each time you open the jar. That's for people. No, you want the Jiff brand for mice. That stuff sticks to the trap platform like glue, and the mice have to wrestle it out of the holes... and that activity is what springs the trap. I suppose Skippy would do in a pinch.It's a shame I had to order a mouse trap online, but I could hear the mice moaning in the dark corners of my house when I clicked the submit button on my Amazon order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17C4XQK6R3F0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HJ79Y4#wasThisHelpful","R17C4XQK6R3F0K","A2RIRJJPGPMM8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RIRJJPGPMM8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although this little LED array is billed as a dome light replacement --and it does indeed come with a variety of adapters for that job-- I actually installed it in my RV to replace a 12vdc light bulb used to illuminate the stove area. The existing bulb draws 5amps of current, which is just too much when you're running on batteries.Given the price, the form factor, the overall lumen level, and the fact that the array comes with a sticky backing that made it ez to mount to the fan hood, this light seemed a perfect fit. And it is! Very very bright. Easily lights up the entire stove area. In fact, I had bought two of these thinking that's would it would take to adequately light up the area. But one unit did the job so well I actually did use the second one to replace the dome light in my 92 Corolla. EZ install and it works great!Current draw on this array is about 300ma.UPDATE: May 2014One of the two units I bought died. It was the one over the stove. It went ""Super Nova"" on me, going way bright and then 95% of the LEDs going out. It also created a short circuit which almost burned out the 12vdc power supply hooked to it. For all I know it may have been grease build up or something that shorted it out. The one in the car keeps on truckin'. So what am I going to do?

"I do not own this product. So why am I writing a review? Because I was telling someone a story today about how I determined the best ice chest on the market a while back, and it's Igloo. Then I realized prospective cooler buyers would like this story...We do a lot of camping in a Westfalia and often go to the desert. Ice always gave out in a few days. We started wondering if one brand of cooler would keep ice longer than another, so we went out and bought every cooler we could find at the local stores. We placed the coolers (about 8 of them) in a room, each with one block of ice, closed the lids, closed the door to the room, and checked the melt rate periodically.To cut right to the chase, the IGLOO ice chest lasted the longest (5-6 days), and the ice in the Coleman cooler melted first (3 days).

"How do they design, build, and ship overseas a really cool 2.1 speaker system and ship it to me for free under Amazon Prime for $38?

Even damaged, it's a little intense for every day use*Because it's a potent moisturizer, it's a little too oily on the face for day use. My face had an awful shine. Best used for dry facial skin avoiding the T-zoneOverall, the benefits supersede the cons. This Moroccan oil works well as a mask for overnight treatment (wrapped with head wrap) and body moisturizer, but everyone differs in terms of skin and hair texture.

"Frontline is the best topical flea and tick repellent I've found for my cats. I prefer a topical solution, because it's hard enough to catch my rescues to dose them each month. Other vet options were injections, and I didn't like the idea of what might could go wrong. Even though the cats act like jerks sometimes and new furniture isn't on the agenda as long as they live, I love them and seek out the best options to keep them comfortable, healthy and happy. I'd absolutely recommend Frontline Plus, because a flea-ridden kitty is a miserable one, and that just sucks. I advise buying the larger quantity boxes, because its less expensive per dose. I've used Frontline Plus on my cats for over five years, and they've never experienced adverse effects or reactions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XQDEJM21KH7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002J1F7G#wasThisHelpful","R1XQDEJM21KH7G","AVXG7ZEC66QGX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVXG7ZEC66QGX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a blended family so tortillas are on the menu at least a couple times a week. When I saw the opportunity for the Ceramic Tortilla Warmer from Uno Casa, I thought it would be a great addition, because tortillas are not tasty when they turn cold and hard. Here are my thoughts on the warmer:Pros*Love the beautiful, vivid coloring. Livens up meal time and makes it festive.*Love the microwave-safe feature, because it expedites the process--important when you have a little diva who will ""die"" if she doesn't eat asap.*Keeps the tortillas fresh and warm for awhile. I tested it out and checked the remaining tortillas in the dish 1.5hrs later, and they were still warm*I noted reviews about the ceramic being chipped, but fortunately that wasn't my experience. The warmer arrived in flawless condition.*Appreciative of the satisfaction guarantee and the xero-breakage (although I'm not going to drop it from the roof to check if its truly unbreakable)Cons*The only design flaw, and it's an important one, is the handle. It's difficult to lift without a handle lip. Without a firm silicone grip or sliding it off the bowl, it is a pain.*None other noted, but if this changes, I will revise my review to reflect any adverse changes.Overall, I love my tortilla warmer, and other than the design flaw, can't find other issue with it.

"I love diffusers and essential oils, because they're safer than candles for aromatherapy and the ideal conduit for oils containing holistic healing properties.

(It fits in my medium-sized hand with ease)*Portability is a huge bonus for me, and the Mobetta fits just so in my console.*For such a small diffuser, it puts out a great stream of mist to freshen my car and any room of my house.

"I'm a diffuser junkie and thrilled to have gotten the Innogear diffuser. I've seen a mixture of reviews ranging from good to bad, but my personal experience has been great. Here is my assessment of the diffuser:Pros*Although the diffuser is a little smaller than anticipated, it's the perfect size for my sitting and standing station*Rather than only one option for a constant stream of mist, I enjoy the additional option to choose intermittent spurts. Some oils are beneficial but a little overwhelming, so the intermittent setting is ideal for this.*I love the seven different light options, and blue is the most calming choice for me*There are no difficult instructions for set up, and the measuring cup and baseline on the diffuser make it easy for even beginner diffuser enthusiasts to enjoy*The smallish size makes the diffuser portable, and this is a convenience for frequent travelers who like to have diffusers with them. Last weekend I took a short weekend trip, and the diffuser fit nicely into my suitcase*Easy to clean and settings interchangeable at any time*Quality and price are reasonable for consumers at the time of this reviewCons*None noted at this time, but I will revise the review accordingly if the diffuser malfunctions before the typical lifespan is reached.I've had the diffuser for a couple of weeks, and I've really enjoyed it this far.

"I've mentioned in several reviews how I had a hair catastrophe from over-processing my hair, and I've been using a number of essential oils, hair masks and serums, strengthening shampoo and conditioner, and even wrapped my hair in saran wrap with coconut oil. However, I've now discovered a little easier route, and it's been in the form of argan oil hair masks. Here are my thoughts on this one:Pros*Has been beneficial in the continuing battle to bring health and shine back to my hair*Nice, thick mask that I use overnight for maximum hair restoration, and rather than using coconut oil, rosehip and other wonderful natural moisturizers separately, it's all included in this mask*After consistent use in the last couple of weeks along with my other measures, my hair is starting to look as nice as it did previously*Love the light, underwhelming fragrance, and with a simple head wrap, no messy pillow the next morning*Void of unhealthy chemicals and helps stimulate the scalp to aid in healthier new growthOverall, I love this Argan Oil Hair Mask, and a huge bonus is it isn't too messy or oily. I simply apply it and go about my business. Fortunately, that business is at home. Of course, with enough damage no product will work miracles, and I did end up having to get a few inches cut. However, I needed a little length taken off anyway, and it helped even more. I'll be using this mask and a couple of others until my hair is back to normal.

"The Blue Ridge Mountains are less than two hours away and are home to some of the most beautiful waterfalls in the southeast, but some of the hiking required to get to them is brutal for one as clumsy as me. I've never had the opportunity to own trekking poles, so I'm always worn out and have tripped over a tree root or two before making it to the waterfall of choice. One nasty fall can easily end in that last goodnight on some of those narrow trails with no barriers to the steep ravines, and after test running these poles on some of the local park trails to prepare, these are my thoughts:Pros*Portability makes life easy for me, and these poles easily collapse and fit without a fight into the sturdy bag they came with*My confidence in avoiding injury or worse has increased, because the poles help keep me steady with the rubber hand grips*I love the adjustable height feature, and I've tested the poles enough to have them out of the bag and locked in place at the ideal height in a flash. I've tried walking sticks before, but they're never at the proper height and I usually end up carrying them or ditching them along the trail.*These trekking poles are deceptively lightweight for the rugged tasks they're made for, and after a few local hilly trails locally, it's obvious they will meet the tougher challenges on the fall agenda to take on some of the most treacherous hiking trails awaiting me in the Chatahoochee National Forest*My legs and feet don't hate me when I use the trekking poles. I've used compression stockings and excellent sneakers for my excursions, but the shock-absorbency of the poles is impressive. Some aches are to be expected after any strenuous cardiovascular task, but since the poles take the brunt of the impact, aches and pains are a fraction of the former pain I used to experience afterwards.*Superior quality and reasonable pricing make these poles highly appealing to any hiking enthusiast, and it's obvious they were designed to last a long timeCons*None noted at this time, but I will revisit my review should that changeI don't know why I didn't think of trekking poles in my life before, because they are awesomeness quantified, and when these wear out at some point in the far future, I'll be buying another set.

"I've tried a variety of rubs, and Biofreeze is one of the two my chiropractor uses in his office, but the other is less effective. His Biofreeze is far more expensive, so I've purchased the smaller quantities, roll on, and spray versions, but this bottle of gel contains much more.Pros*Freezes away pain in my back, neck, and shoulders from long hours of working*Economic size makes it less expensive per ounce, and it's lasted awhile already*Allows me to wait it out a little longer before going to see the chiropractor which saves me more moneyCons*The smell is a strong mentholated odor, and I smell like a grandmother.*Messier that the roll-on kind and spray, so it easily gets on clothes (but easily washes out)I saw reviews dated back to 2013 saying that this wasn't the same product, so I'm assuming they went back to the old formula or something, because it brings relief when nothing else will.

"I've used a lot of anti-aging moisturizers, but I've never had the opportunity to try Yeouth until recently. Nothing will completely stop aging, but a great moisturizer is a critical part of slowing down the process. Here are my takeaways from Yeouth:Pros*Nice and thick but not greasy or heavy when applied*Convenient, functional pump to measure the amount needed (face and neck, roughly a dollop the size of a pea needed)*Skin looks and feels smooth, soft, and beautiful*Several natural ingredients good for the skin such as aloe and grapeseed oil*Formulation is good for all skin types provided the specific individual has no allergies to any of the ingredients. Always check your labels.*Small vial but will last awhile due to the small amount needed to moisturize the skinCons*Contains polysorbate 60 where studies from the 1950's showed potential for cancer but only in high dosages. Highly outdated research but more needed.*Contains tocopherol which isn't noted skin irritant but is an eye irritant. Use caution around the eye area.Overall, it's a nice moisturizer to use but to see anti-aging benefits, long-term use is needed.

"Essential oils are huge in my household, and I especially love concentrated oils with a variety of uses. Ylang Ylang is one I had no experience with, but I've researched essential oils and most are useful when steam distilled from the actual plant they're derived from. Synthetics are bunk, so always check the labels. Here are my thoughts on this brand of Ylang Ylang Oil.Pros*Steam distilled process. 100% natural, and large quantity*I love the light floral fragrance. It's not powerful or overwhelming, and I'm enjoying it for aromatherapy in my office diffuser.*Glass dropper is included, allowing for a more precise dosage than the average plastic dropper.*Is a nice calming, soothing addition to a warm bath, and there's no need to use too much of it to achieve the result.*According to most of my research, Ylang ylang is good for anxiety, stress, and anger, helps maintain healthy skin (including excema), helps the nervous system, and reduces blood pressure. Some research also indicates there is insufficient evidence to deduce Ylang Ylang is beneficial, but I believe in trying natural solutions over pharmaceuticals as often as possible..*When used is as a moisturizer, I enjoy the fragrance and my skin feels smooth and soft.*I wrecked my hair going from no processing to over-processing overnight a few weeks ago, and since Ylang Ylang is recommended for scalp stimulation to help hair growth, I've been using it for that, also.. So far the jury is out on this, but it doesn't leave my hair limp and gross when I use it on my scalp overnight.ConsNone noted, but pregnant women are advised to refrain from using Ylang Ylang until further researched.If something negative happens while using Ylang Ylang for external use only (I wouldn't see the benefit of ingesting it), I'll come back to revise my review.I did receive this product at a discount for an honest review, and I never guarantee 5 stars or recommend a product I wouldn't use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TXAOGJ5AEBVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YMMOHU6#wasThisHelpful","R1TXAOGJ5AEBVX","AVXG7ZEC66QGX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVXG7ZEC66QGX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After washing my face, I apply a nice toner, thin layer of the serum and then a light moisturizer after it dries.

"This pillow is absolutely fabulous!!! My 9yr old loves to use it, because it's plush, soft, and an ideal size for her. I love that it's hypoallergenic, because she gets the sniffles for seemingly unknown reasons outside of the typical allergy season, so I'll be able to rule out the pillow as the cause during my next allergy investigation. What a relief not to have to worry about needing a pillow case, too! Small travel pillow cases, socks, and other small laundry items tend to disappear around here, and I have no idea how or why.

"I love the variety of vitamin C serums, especially when they include retinol, and I opted in for this for the anti-aging properties and occasional blemish. Thus far I like it. It's not my favorite one ever, but it certainly keeps my face looking nice when used in conjunction with my normal skincare routine. I've seen reviews about allergic reactions, and fortunately I haven't experienced adverse affects. I'll update this review if something unusual arises, because I strive to be helpful and informative in my consumer reviews. This is the first product I've tried with niacinamide, but I'm waiting to see how well it improves elasticity and nourishes my face. I don't think it will take away the freckles I've always had, but that's genetics and not product. I'm relieved the dosage of salicylic acid is only 2%, because it alone can be incredibly potent.

"I am a huge essential oils fan, and I was a wellness advocate for another brand that was high quality but high priced. I love this lavender oil, because I can use it for so many things. My daughter always comes first, and when she's sick, I always mix a ratio of lavender oil and coconut/olive/safflower oil, and rub it along her neck, cheeks, chin, and spray a little on her pillow. Even when she's restless with a fever, this calms her and knocks her out every time. Unfortunately she caught a bug last week, but it gave me the opportunity to test this lavender oil, and it worked beautifully to calm her and put her to sleep. I like to run it in my diffuser when I feel anxious and need to chill out a little, and as long as I don't go overboard (the smell is potent), I enjoy the fragrance and feeling. It works the same way when I take a nice, long bath and put a little lavender in it. One of the most important things to look for in essential oils is the way they are extracted, and steam has been touted as the proper way to do it. This oil is steam distilled, and it's a plus for me that these oils come from ethically farmed, pesticide-free fields. I also appreciated the helpful books sent to give me more tips and uses.

"I'm the first to admit I'm not the best about getting proper nutrition, and I definitely don't eat the fruits and veggies I should. I nag my kid to death and make sure she gets her servings in but often work so much I neglect me. Cranberry supplements are a great addition to the ones I take, but it's not so much because of UTI infection problems. These small, easy-to-swallow pills have an insanely high concentration of amazing vitamins, and there are just some of the benefits I've researched:Because cranberries contain proanthyocyanide which prevents the formation of plaque, it's great for oral health. Cranberries also have anti-inflammatory properties that reduce inflammation of the gums to help teeth-supporting tissues.A 2005 study revealed cranberry can also help prevent H.Pylori infection, a bacteria which can cause peptic ulcers and stomach cancer.Cran contains antioxidants that fight free radicals (bonus age fighter!). For those unfamiliar with free radicals, they're nasty little things able to cause damage to cellular structures. Cran ranks among the highest fruits with antioxidants.Their anti-inflammatory properties make them great for reducing chronic inflammation in the stomach and large intestine and are mostly responsible for the cardiovascular benefits, too. The phytonutrients are responsible for fighting inflammation and with the combined antioxidants help lower LDL (bad cholesterol) and total cholesterol for cardiovascular health.Studies are showing a possible link between cranberries potential anti-cancer and immune system boosting abilities. I'm watching for more peer-reviewed studies and conclusive findings and will update if I find something significant.Even though I received these supplements in exchange for an honest review, I accepted the review because I know cranberry supplements are potent agents supporting overall health and wellbeing.

"I thought this was a good idea. I have ~200 lumens flashlights that cost twice this flashlight / charger combo. And it looks impressive and feels good in the hand with the rubberized exterior. But after using it for a couple of days, I was rather disappointed.I'm only rating it average for 3 reasons :1. The flashlight button is quite difficult to press. I'm not sure if it is an issue only with my light. The lower button is much easier to press, so it might be a manufacturing defect.2. The flap protecting the ports from water and dust is rather loose, and is easily knocked open.3. USB charging requires you to manually turn it on. Almost all other USB chargers will start charging your device when you plug it in.I also had the red (low battery) light turn on after only using the flashlight on high intermittently for less than 10 minutes. I will run a test to see how long it takes to deplete and update.I'm also a little disappointed at the low capacity (3000 mAh) and that it is only water resistant instead of waterproof, but as these are stated in the product description, I did not lower my rating based on that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJTBFJG36A8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36XX6C#wasThisHelpful","RYJTBFJG36A8","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned a number of headphones over the years, and I know what I like : good quality earbuds for portable use, clear and accurate sound reproduction, no perceivable distortion, over ear headphones for desk use, and avoid anything that says ""enhanced bass"" like the plague. I like DJ type headphones because they're closed (so no one else complains about noise), blocks external noise, have a neutral sound quality (if I want to tweak the sound, I want to do it with an equalizer) and I have a strong distaste for boosted bass, as it tends to drown out the details of a musical piece.The closest thing I have to this is the Sennheiser HD280 Pro, which I purchased in 2003. Even taking inflation into account, this one is still about 3 times what I paid for the Sennheiser. So what's the difference?The most obvious difference is the build quality, The HD280 has come plastic clips on the headband. They broke within the first week of me owning it, and I was only using it at home. I fixed them in place with clear packing tape, and they've held up well over the last 12 years, but it was still very disappointing to have it break so soon after buying. The A5Pro is built like a tank. Lots of aluminum all over. It is heavier than the HD280, of course, but surprisingly not that much heavier.The headphones come with cushions that fit over the ear, but in my case, just barely. I'd like larger ear cushions. The cushions are easily removed and replaced with a slight twist. The included cushions are 93mm in diameter. 80mm (on-ear) and 110mm cushions are also available. The cable is detachable, locks in place when pointing down, and - this is the part I really appreciate - can be attached on either the left or the right. I thought I read that there is a shorter, non-coiled cable with mic input available that can be used on a phone, but I have not seen it for sale.Speaking of travel, it can fold into a really compact size, and comes with a simple cloth bag for transport. When folding the cups up, there is a pretty loud click as a plastic clip releases for it to swivel up. This is the only part I'm worried about it breaking, as it is not easily replaced.Sound isolation is good, but not as good as a well fitted pair of earbuds. It also works both ways - it keeps external noise out, and it keeps what you're listening to from leaking out. The cushions are nice and soft, and fairly comfortable, but if you're not used to DJ style phones, you may find them tight. And you will definitely feel the weight. My HD280 feels more comfortable, but it is like an old pair of shoes, broken in, and the comparison is not fair. I recall the HD280 felt tighter when it was new as well.OK, enough about the construction and the great design. How does it sound?It sounds great to me. I hear all the details very clearly, and it does appear to be quite neutral (I have no way of measuring this except by comparing it to other headphones, like the V-Moda M-80, which sounds a fair bit brighter. Bass is not artificially boosted (yes!) but if you're listening to a bass heavy track, you definitely can hear the bass. I tried it with a range of music, from classical, to vocals, instrumentals, rock, and it performs superbly. Compared to my HD280, it sounds more substantial. Don't get me wrong, the HD280 sounds great, but when comparing it side by side, it sounded a bit hollow. I'm sure I'm not using the correct audiophile terms for this. The difference is not great, but it is definitely there, and easily heard.The headphones claim to be able to handle 3500 mW. I'm not sure what 3500 mW will sound like, but I'm pretty sure it's a recipe for hearing loss. When I first plugged it into my computer, I had the volume at 40%. It was loud! On the bright side, I didn't detect any distortion even at that ridiculous level that was not there at a lower volume.Used with my phone, the sound level seemed slightly lower compared to my earbuds, but surprisingly not by much.The only thing that gave me pause is the price. It fluctuates a bit, but no one is ever going to describe it as ""inexpensive"". It has a great design, solid build quality, and sounds great. Is it worth 3 times the price of the Sennheiser HD280 Pro? That's a hard question to answer if you're not a professional DJ. If you like DJ style headphones, however, it is definitely worth considering.Now I just need to figure out where to buy the 110mm cushions from.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17D8E4KO0FS83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU2KJSO#wasThisHelpful","R17D8E4KO0FS83","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my 3rd stapling pliers, the other two are the Bostitch B8  Xtreme Duty 45 Sheet Plier Stapler, Black (B8HDP) and the Rapesco Porpoise Classic Plier Stapler, 40 Sheet Capacity, Chrome (R81000A3). I purchased the Bostitch for a project originally, and this as well as the Rapesco were provided for review. No one person really needs 3 stapling pliers, obviously.The Bostitch could be opened up to be used for tacking (to stick a sheet of paper to a cork board, for example) and requires slightly less force for the same amount of paper, either due to the design of the staples or to the longer handle. The Bostitch's handle is plastic, unlike this and the Rapesco, which are 100% metal.Comparing the Rapid K1 and the Rapesco Porpoise, they have more in common than not. They can both pin as well as staple by changing the anvil (pinning is similar to stapling, but the legs bend outwards instead of inwards - like using a pin to hold a few sheets of paper together. It's easier to remove than staples). By size, weight, looks, and construction, they are very similar. One major difference - the Rapid K1 handles a 50 page stack of regular copier paper without any problems, but the Rapesco doesn't grip it as well. Fair enough, given that this one claims to have a 50 page capacity, while the Rapesco only claims 40.In use, on the same stack of paper, I find the Rapid K1 to need just a bit less force to staple. The end result looks identical. They have the same mechanism for loading staples, but I find the Rapid K1 to be more difficult to load, as the hook that holds the spring in place is not as smooth to engage and disengage as the Rapesco. The Rapesco has ridges on the bottom handle for a better grip, but the ridges don't really make any difference in the grip. The spring on the Rapid K1 looks stronger - the wire is about twice the thickness of the Rapesco.Summary of above sentence : this stapler requires slightly less force for the same amount of paper, has a stronger spring to hold the staples in place, but loading staples is slightly more difficult as it doesn't unhook as easily.The paint on this Rapid K1 protects it somewhat from fingerprints, but the price difference for some of the colors make it a bit hard to justify. Fortunately, there is also a version without any paint on it if all you care about is utility.I find the Bostitch to be easier to use, but if you're worried about plastic parts breaking, this or the Rapesco are both good choices. This one has an edge with thicker stacks of paper,","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OD5NK1EKHF00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDCIAPU#wasThisHelpful","R3OD5NK1EKHF00","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many things to like about this bag. Let's start with that.It's a small backpack designed to hold two GoPros and some accessories securely. The case is very well made. The material feels great, the zippers smooth, it is comfortable to wear (in one position - more on this later) and while wearing it, you can easily swivel it to the front to access the items in it. Thought has been given to small details, like an oversized zipper pull so that it is easier to grab when wearing gloves.It has one main compartment (where the foam insert goes in) with two zippered pockets (cables, memory cards), one smaller compartment where you can put accessories, and a tiny compartment lined with a softer material for a cell phone - that should just barely fit the largest phones today. There's a smaller phone pouch on the main strap that will not fit a phone with a 5"" or larger screen. I wish the front pouch is not there, so that I can use a Polar Pro backpack mount.The foam insert is easily removable. I suppose you could get your own foam insert built for custom gear. The one supplied will hold two GoPros inside a waterproof case (they must be inside the case, or it will rattle around), two BacPacs (battery or LCD), one wireless remote, and two batteries.The most comfortable way to wear this is to sling it diagonally, with the strap resting on the left shoulder - as shown in the video. You could wear it on your right shoulder by not slinging it diagonally, but it is not as secure or comfortable. There's a smaller cross strap to further secure it so that it doesn't move around. That small strap needs to be unclasped to swing the back forward to access the backpack - or to hold it in front when you're in a crowded place and you're worried about pickpockets.I think this bag deserves more than 4 stars, but not quite 5 stars, due to the high price and inflexibility with the inserts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EF29TVTDQY7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI4KFX2#wasThisHelpful","R3EF29TVTDQY7J","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure : I was offered this unit for review by Arkon, but with no obligation on how I write my review, after they saw my review on the GN047.I could go on about how much I disliked the GN047 - it falls off frequently, it was finicky to put on, the clips look fragile, and the ball socket was a bit loose for a 5"" Nuvi (the 2460).First improvement : there is only one beefy clip instead of two small fragile looking clip. MUCH easier to install. And the most important part, it stays where you put it.Next improvement : the ball appears to be slightly larger. It holds the same GPS without shifting. So there's no need to constantly adjust it. And when you do adjust it, it doesn't just fall off the vent like the GN047.If there is one negative, it is the price, about $5 higher than the GN047. But it is worth the difference just to avoid the frustration that is the GN047. However, at this price, it comes close to the price of a dashboard friction mount (a sandbag mount) which is more convenient - it has more flexibility in mounting positions, and it doesn't block the AC on hot summer days. In fact, an AmazonBasics friction mount is less expensive than the price of this right now. Vent mounts do hold the GPS more securely than friction mounts, especially after about a year of use when the grippy part seems to lose its effectiveness. The reason I got the GN047 was because my Nuvi on the Garmin friction mount was sliding off every time I make a turn.Again, I did receive this at no cost to me for review, but I feel that it is totally worth the higher cost compared to the GN047. If you're considering getting the GN047, do yourself a favor and get this one instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19BOBXPH8CACJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SV2LZW6#wasThisHelpful","R19BOBXPH8CACJ","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received mine free for review, but I will gladly pay for it.I had an earlier version of the Contigo Autospout (the Addison). This one has a few improvements over it :1. Screw-in straw that won't drop off2. Switch to lock the spout from popping out3. Carabiner clip built into the handleI used that for more than 2 years before I lost it. It had functioned flawlessly, and for one handed use (e.g. when cycling) I find it to be very convenient, and it was my favorite non-insulated water bottle. I was about to buy a replacement when I was offered this one.It has the same features : screw off top makes it easy to fill, and easy to clean (I highly recommend the Oxo bottle brush). Spring loaded spout pops out when button is pressed, spout easily closed with the thumb. Shield keeps spout from coming into contact with clothes, although it won't keep out fine dust. I have Camel bottles with a spout that needs to be lifted manually. There's just something satisfying about having it flick open at the press of a button. I'd sometimes find myself absent mindedly opening / closing the spout continuously while reading, much to the irritation of my wife.I filled it with water, removed the straw (it is more likely to spill without the straw), turned it upside down, and shook vigorously for about 30 seconds. There were a few small drops of water, but I'd say it is indeed spillproof. Leaving it upside down for a few minutes, nothing spilled.One issue with the Addison is that if left in the sun, the expanding air will force some water out. I expect this to have the same issue. Might be an issue with elevation changes as well - I'll test this the next time I go on a hike.A couple of small negatives about this bottle : the lock is a bit difficult to operate with one hand using the thumb, and it seems to take a little more effort to suck up the water compared to the older design. The lid felt heavier than the previous one as well.I think the improved straw is worth the slightly higher price compared to the Contigo Addison. The lock is a good assurance against it popping open in your bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OX2FWLYV22BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYBBYN8#wasThisHelpful","R1OX2FWLYV22BS","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had to look at a photo to confirm that those two plastic tabs really fit around the corners of the LCD panel. Together with the two elastic bands for the lower part of the laptop, it works surprisingly well and smoothly with my T450s - opening the case means that the laptop is opened, and I don't need to remove it from the sleeve in order to use it.The material feels like some kind of synthetic fabric, and the shell is mostly rigid. It has a 3D pattern that should provide some additional cushioning in case of bumps without adding much bulk, and it looks quite attractive as well.The only problem with this sleeve is that there is no space for a power adapter or accessories such as a mouse. It also blocks some vents and in some cases may cause a laptop to overheat and throttle down. If you're worried your backpack may not provide enough protection, or if you want a sleeve around your laptop at all times to protect it from scratches and knocks even when in use, this is an excellent choice, especially for laptops with excellent battery life and doesn't run too hot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2315NCJP9CAPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVZPTOU#wasThisHelpful","R2315NCJP9CAPZ","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this is a great looking laundry cart, there are some flaws that really shouldn't be there in a $50 laundry basket.First, there is a small gap on one of the side frames. Not a big deal, and if this is the only flaw, I'd have rated it 5 stars.The hooks where the laundry bags hang from don't just drop easily into the top rail. This is a minor point, and again, if this is the only flaw, I'd still rate it 5 stars.Next, the edges are sharp. If you knock into a corner, even at a fairly low speed, it is going to hurt a lot. I wish the edges are beveled or rounded. I may try doing this with sandpaper to see if it affects the finish on the bamboo.Finally, the casters are stiff and the cart does not roll easily. Yes, I did check to make sure they're not locked.For the same price, I bought the Seville Classics Heavy-Duty 3-Bag Laundry Sorter Cart a year and a half ago. Still working great and looks just like new. Like this one, it has great build quality. It doesn't look as attractive as this one with its bamboo frame, but the casters roll smoothly and there's no sharp corners to knock into. The casters on this one is what I'm really unhappy with. Other than that, assembly is very easy and everything fits together perfectly. All attachment points on the bamboo frames have metal screw threads embedded into the bamboo frame so there's no fear of the threads getting stripped. I will try to find replacement caster wheels and to sand down the edges, but for a laundry basket at this price, it shouldn't be necessary for me to do so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NSVYM8DU7XZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH5QTJW#wasThisHelpful","R2NSVYM8DU7XZZ","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first ""real"" backpack. I've had other backpacks, but none of them are as large, or have an internal frame. With a little adjustment, it fits me comfortably. I was surprised by how light it is relative to the size. Adjusting the torso fit strap is easy - as long as you're making it shorter. I'm not exactly flexible, but I could easily reach the loops and pull it to tighten until it is just right. If you over-tighten, however, you'll need to take it off to loosen it. Not a major inconvenience.The backpack does not fit either of my teenage daughters, however. They can carry it, but even when adjusted for the shortest torso length, it does not fit them perfectly - if the shoulder straps sit perfectly, the waist belt is an inch or two too low. They're 5' 3"" and 5' 7"" - not exactly short. I believe it will fit them better as they grow.The number of straps on this looks quite intimidating at first glance, but a closer inspection showed what they're for. Some of the straps may be more easily adjusted by another person after you've put on the pack (remember that I'm not flexible). There's a large main compartment with top access and a zipper for side access, and a few smaller pockets - one zippered pocket on the lid, two zippered pockets at both sides of the waist belt (the only ones easily reached without removing the backpack), two side pockets for water bottles, and a compartment for a hydration pack.Tag on bag says it is made in Vietnam. The backpack has a limited lifetime warranty - Kelty's website says it includes material and workmanship, but does not include normal wear and tear, or damage from hazardous weather, animals, UV light or abuse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OL620EM76D7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCEZ56#wasThisHelpful","R2OL620EM76D7P","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really want to like this activity tracker. But the limitations are just too frustrating to me.I've been using a Mi Band for the last two months. It is a very inexpensive device and looks nowhere as solid as the UP3. I'll compare the two devices later. First, let's look at what the UP3 provides.If you want an app that nags at you, provides lots of feedback and tips, points you to studies about health and fitness, this app is for you. On the other hand, if you just want something to track your activity, you may feel irritated by the app. I don't think it is quite that bad, but I would have preferred a much lower ""nag level"".The UP3 contains an accelerometer (to track movement), heartbeat sensor, galvanic skin response (to measure skin conductivity), and according to the specs on the website, tracks respiration as well. Anything else it tracks - your weight and caloric intake, are entered by you into the app. The only interaction with the app is to tap on it to wake it up, then to put it into either wake mode (running icon) or sleep mode (moon icon). It doesn't appear to be strictly necessary - I forgot to switch it once and it seems to still measure my sleep that night.The accelerometer works as advertised. It would measure steps even on a treadmill or elliptical (provided you're moving your arms on the elliptical). Heartbeat sensor seems to be used only to measure your resting heart rate. Sure, it is good to know my resting heart rate when I'm sleeping, but it would have been great to know my heart rate when exercising. I'm not sure why this is not provided - I can only guess it is due to some technical limitation.I have no idea what is galvanic skin response used to measure with the UP3. Maybe it is only used to keep track of whether the tracker is being worn? GSR together with heart beat and blood pressure is used in a lie detector, so maybe the UP3 can tell if you're lying when you're entering your weight.The clasp is quite frustrating for me. The video makes it look so simple to put on, but for me it has been frustrating to put it on with one hand. Maybe it gets easier with practice. I almost lost it 3 times in the 1 week I've been using it when the clasp came undone because I brushed it against something. Fortunately I noticed it in time.The magnetic charging cable is very nice, but not perfect. The cable is short and inflexible, and the strap on the UP3 is inflexible as well. You need to position everything properly when charging, and sometimes it involves propping up the UP3 with a book. A short and flexible USB extension cable may be helpful.Battery life of about 7 days seem pretty accurate. The UP3 can vibrate to alert the wearer of alarms or reminders. For some reason, I cannot set one time off reminders. Reminders will repeat on the same days every week.Now, let's compare it to the Mi Band.The most obvious difference is price. The Mi Band sells for about 1/10 of the price of the UP3. It does not have a heart rate monitor (rumors that the next version will have it) but you can get one for much less than the difference in price, and the HRM will track your heart rate during exercise, and not just resting heart rate.The next difference is battery life. Somehow, the Mi Band can last for 30 days on a single charge. Extremely impressive.I thought I'd test this by wearing it together with the Mi Band. Either by sheer coincidence, or by some strange interaction, my Mi Band that had been working flawlessly for more than a month suddenly malfunctioned after I installed the UP app and added the UP3, and it died the next day. I don't blame Jawbone for this - if there's any fault here, it lies entirely with the Mi Band. As a result, I couldn't do a side by side test of the two, but in terms of number of steps measured, they seem to be in the same ballpark.Compared to the UP app, the Mi Fit app is very spartan.Now this is the part that disappoints me the most : what the Mi Band can do, and the UP3 cannot.1. Smart lock. Android allows you to add a Bluetooth device as a trusted device. What this means is that if your device and phone are close to each other, the phone will remain unlocked, unless it has been idle for a long time (a few hours), or you explicitly lock it. It is very convenient, and I miss it terribly.2. Notifications. The Mi Band can vibrate when you receive a phone call. With 3rd party applications, you can also have it vibrate on other notifications, such as when receiving SMS, a chat request (Hangouts, Whatsapp, etc.). To me that's the most useful function I want out of a smart watch, and I can get it without having to deal with the high price and short battery life of a smart watch.I didn't quite expect it to handle notifications (although it should be possible through software) but I was genuinely shocked and bitterly disappointed when I can't use it for Smart Lock. I don't see the UP3 under paired devices in my Bluetooth setup. If it's not a paired device, it cannot be a trusted device. I was so sure I made a mistake, and started searching the web for a solution, but I could not find one.I rated this 3 stars because it does what it is supposed to, and it appears to do it reasonably well. But compared to a Fitbit Charge HR (which has heart rate monitor, and adds a display, for a lower price) and to a Mi Band (no heart rate monitor, but MUCH cheaper and adds a bunch of convenience features that has nothing to do with activity tracking), I find it extremely hard to recommend this to anyone. It may be the most advanced tracker, but a lot of that potential is unrealized.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XR3EF5EBFP90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9E6DUK#wasThisHelpful","R1XR3EF5EBFP90","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I prefer to carry my DSLR with additional lenses in a camera backpack. I currently use a LowePro Fastpack 200, and I'm able to squeeze in a 5D Mark III with a 24-105mm f/4L, a 50mm f/1.4, a 580EX flash, and a 70-200mm f/2.8 IS in the top compartment. That's a fairly heavy load to be carrying around, but it is fairly comfortable, and it leaves my hands free. With that backpack, it is very easy to take out the camera - slip off a shoulder strap, swing it in front, open side pocket, and remove camera.There are two main disadvantage of the backpack. The bulk can be pretty awkward in crowded places, and everyone knows that you have photography equipment in there. It's harder to keep an eye on things when it is on your back.This messenger bag doesn't look big, but to my surprise it fits that whole list of stuff mentioned above - apart from the 70-200mm lens - pretty comfortably. There's still some space left that will fit another small lens, or the camera's battery charger. There's also two pockets - one velcroed and one zippered - that will hold the usual spare batteries, memory cards, filters. There's also a slot in the side compartment that can fit a tablet. My 11"" Acer Chromebook fits in there fairly comfortably as well.All the camera gear fits into a pod that can be removed. If you want to use this for something other than photography gear, the insert comes out easily with all your gear securely held in it. Without the insert, you can fit a 13"" or 14"" laptop in there, though it is a tight fit with the 14"".There's a zipper to access the tablet sleeve without opening the flap. You can reach your tablet, wallet, purse, or whatever small item you store in there without showing everyone that you're carrying a camera in your messenger bag.The bag is sturdy, the shell made of nylon and is water resistant, and it is quite attractive. And it comes with an amazing 25 year warranty.Much as I like it, I do have one quibble about it. The clips that hold the bag closed are somewhat awkward to operate. The buckle is partly recessed into a flap, and if you have fat fingers like mine, it's not easy to release the clip when carrying the bag. It's also difficult for me to buckle it back up without looking at what I'm doing - that may get easier with practice.It is not as comfortable to carry as the backpack - no surprise, since weight is distributed across two straps. But the way weight is distributed, it is not bad, and significantly better than carrying the backpack with only one strap.Overall, I prefer the backpack for long trips, especially if I have to bring it on a plane, but this messenger bag looks perfect for a day trip when I don't need huge telephoto lenses.For anyone who finds the country of manufacture important, the tag says the bag is made in Vietnam.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBBINWGL6NLA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QWRMWKQ#wasThisHelpful","RBBINWGL6NLA2","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hole puncher is built like a tank. It has a big footprint and is really not meant to be moved around. I can't really tell if the ""50% less effort"" claim is true - it does take less effort to punch through thicker stacks of paper. It can punch through 45 sheets of copier paper with a little effort. The springs are really strong on this one, so it takes a fair amount of effort to press it down even if there is no paper. But punching through paper only takes a little incremental effort. The arm makes it really easy to push down with the palm of your hand, unlike smaller hole punchers.Hole position is perfect. When aligned properly, which is really easy to do, the distance between top of page and top hole and bottom of page and bottom hole is identical, and middle hole is positioned exactly in the center. And of course it fits a 3 ring binder perfectly.I've owned hole punchers where you can adjust the alignment guides, disable the center hole, even change the position of the holes. This one has nothing adjustable. The only moveable part (other than the handle) is the lock, to hold the handle down, potentially saving some space. No need to worry about accidentally releasing the lock and having the handle spring up. To unlock, you need to press down a bit on the handle before unlocking.The base is plastic and has 4 little felt circles to keep it from sliding around. It doesn't grip as well as rubber feet, but it does the job and does not slide around in use.The tray is the weakest part of the hole puncher. It does not latch / unlatch smoothly, and when removing the tray to empty it, I usually spill a bit of the chips. Maybe it will get smoother with use. A little disappointing in an otherwise fantastic hole puncher.If you have lots of material to punch, and the table space for this, it's a great hole puncher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KK17U4HAX9JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIM5QAU#wasThisHelpful","R2KK17U4HAX9JK","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own another stapler that can staple 40+ sheets of paper, the Bostitch B8HDP. I've had it for over 4 years now, and it is what I'm comparing this stapler against.Construction : the Bostitch has a plastic sheath over the metal guts. This Rapesco is all metal. Plastic may make it more comfortable to hold. While the Bostitch's loading mechanism is a plastic clip that will probably be the first thing to break, this Rapesco is all metal and looks like it should outlast me easily.Staple : Both the Bostitch and this Rapesco takes special staples. The Rapesco staple is very slightly wider (1/2"" wide) and almost twice as thick - about 1/128"" for the Bostitch and 1/64"" for the Rapesco.Use : I tested with a stack of 45 sheets of normal photocopier paper. Even though the Rapesco Porpoise is rated for 40 sheets, it stapled through it without any problem. The Rapesco (with 24/8mm staples) may take slightly more effort than the Bostitch (with 3/8"" PowerCrown) but the difference is negligible. I do have large hands (glove size L to XL), but it was very little effort to operate either stapler.Other uses : The Rapesco has an anvil (the part at the lower ""lip"" which bends the legs of the staple) that can be rotated to pin paper instead of staple them together. What's pinning, and what is it used for? Normally the legs of a staple bends inwards to hold paper together. In pinning, the legs bend outwards, to form almost a straight line. It is used to hold paper together temporarily as it is easier to remove. The Bostitch cannot be used for pinning.The Bostitch, on the other hand, can be used for tacking. The lower jaw can be unhinged and the stapler used to, for example, tack notices to a cork board. The jaw of the Rapesco is one solid piece, so that's not going to work.Price : The Rapesco is almost half the price of the Bostitch.If you need to staple thick stacks of paper (normal staplers can handle about 20 sheets) this stapler is an incredible value. Just remember to buy the special staples - it does not take ""normal"" staples.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FXG8PFORO1IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NLVDFM#wasThisHelpful","R1FXG8PFORO1IH","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The box that this comes in is huge. Due to the shape of the contents, there is a lot of empty space in the box. Don't panic when it arrives at your front door.The satin black finish on the units is subtle and does not draw any attention to it. There are two LEDs on the sound bar that provides status. I don't find them distracting, but if you do, black electrical tape is always an option. The subwoofer fires to the right side when placed as intended, when you're facing the TV. The sound bar is just a little bit longer than my tiny 42"" Panasonic TV.Setup is extremely simple. Significantly easier than wiring up a surround sound system, and all parts except for wall mount are included. If you want to mount this on the wall, a drilling template is supplied, but you need to get your own mounting hardware (2 x drywall anchor if necessary and screw).As the name suggests, the connection between the sound bar and the subwoofer is wireless. The sound bar needs 2 connections - one for power, through a power brick, and one for input. The woofer needs to be connected to a wall power socket, but can be located anywhere within 50 feet of the sound bar.An optical (TOSLINK) cable is supplied. If you want to use RCA cable instead (or in addition) of optical, you need to supply your own. Either way, physical installation consists of :1. Connect power cable to subwoofer2. Connect power cable to power brick, and power brick cable to sound bar3. Connect optical cable from TV to sound bar4. Insert coin battery into remote controlIf you need longer power cables, the cable type for both the subwoofer and the power brick is the common IEC 60320 C7 (a.k.a. ""Figure 8"") ungrounded cable.You're done. You can start using it. The supplied remote control has a few buttons : Power, volume up / down, mute, input select, bluetooth, and 3D. Using the input select, you can choose between 3 inputs : optical (LED is green), RCA (LED is yellow - actually more like a lighter green) or Bluetooth (LED is blue). Power it up, it takes about 3 to 4 seconds before you start hearing sound. If you have a separate audio player with RCA out, you can hook up both your TV and audio player to the sound bar.Some additional setup makes life just a little easier. First, turn off the speakers on your TV. Not only is the sound from this way better than the TV's speakers, there seems to be a small but detectable time difference between soundbar and TV speaker output when I play video from my BluRay player, resulting in a very odd echo effect. Next, you can configure the sound bar to recognize your TV remote's volume up / down / mute buttons, so that you can use the TV remote for these instead of the sound bar's remote - less juggling of remotes when watching TV.Some people have mentioned that it comes on when the TV is turned on. It only happened once with me - if I turn off the switch behind the sound bar, then back on, it is in standby mode. When I turn on the TV (using the TV's remote control) after that, the sound bar comes on as well. But when I turn the TV off, the sound bar remains on. I have to use the Klipsch remote control to put it in standby. After that, turning the TV on does not turn on the sound bar, but adjusting the volume will turn it on, so it's not a major hassle. It would be nice if it turns on / off together with the TV though.Bluetooth pairing took me a couple of tries to set up. When I turn the sound bar off and on again, I had to disable / re-enable Bluetooth on my phone to get it to reconnect. I need to experiment more with this, and will update this review. By comparison, my Jabra Bluetooth devices connect flawlessly to my phone almost every time.The sound from the TV is best described as ""better than nothing"". Compromises obviously have to be made when fitting speakers onto a flat panel TV. That this sound bar sounds better than the TV should come as no surprise to anyone. But what surprised me is how much better it sounded. Obviously the bass that was missing from the TV's built-in speakers adds a whole new dimension to the sound. But even the mid range sounds much clearer. Speech is definitely easier to understand. And you can crank up the volume very high without much distortion.I tried the ""3D"" effect but I'm not impressed with it. It does change the sound, but I felt it's for the worse, and I couldn't really detect any 3D effect. I'd consider this a very good stereo speaker system, but it won't give you an immersive experience of a true surround system.The manual is pretty minimal and is mostly pictures with few words. The only part I found just a little confusing is the instructions on how to reprogram the remote control buttons - the step numbers are jumbled around, but it's not difficult to figure it out.1. When LED on sound bar is solid green, press and hold MUTE button until LED flashes yellow2. Press button to be reprogrammed (MUTE, VOL+ or VOL-). LED will change to solid yellow3. Press corresponding button on TV remote control 4 times slowly. Each time the LED will flash green.4. LED will go back to solid green when programming is complete.I measured the total power draw of subwoofer + sound bar with a Kill-a-Watt and got the following measurements :Standby : 1 WOn : 9WSoundbar On, Subwoofer Off : 5WOn, volume cranked up : 10WBoth the sound bar and subwoofer have physical power switches located at the back if you want to trade convenience for saving power.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TCQG9MWOPP5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3RW64K#wasThisHelpful","R2TCQG9MWOPP5D","A2W9GX82SLKROQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W9GX82SLKROQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's inexpensive, has power to spare, no ugly wall wart, uses a detachable C7 (""figure 8"") cable, and supports USB OTG. Device won't charge when using USB OTG.

Flash drive may require additional software - especially if you have an unrooted Nexus device.I like the detachable cable. If I'm traveling overseas, I can usually pick up a C7 cable for that country and leave the supplied US cable at home.

"It didn't take much experimenting to figure out how to install this, which is fortunate since it did not come with any instructions. I contacted Retrospec Bicycles and was told that no instructions is available. Basically, you attach one part to your bicycle - hooks over the handle and a velcro strap around the post. Then lift the handles in the basket straight up, slot everything nicely into the part attached to the bicycle. Lower the handles, and the basket is locked in place. I suggest pressing down on the basket to make sure it won't come into contact with the front tire even with a lot of weight in the basket. There's a support that can be adjusted for distance from post, but be careful with that - I managed to pinch my finger adjusting that as it is fairly tight. Gloves would be good if you're clumsy like me.The basket is heavy, but this is obviously not meant for road bikes. It provides an easy way to carry things for short commutes. I can carry a backpack, but it gets pretty warm. Having it in the basket means I can get to the train station without getting all sweaty.

For some reason, the apple flavor seems to taste less sweet than the other two, even though it has about the same amount of sugar.

"I received this cable for review, as well as the PVC type, both 3 ft length.The cables are well constructed and the ends molded nicely. They're also quite flexible. The TPE might be slightly more flexible than the PVC, but the difference is very small. The most obvious difference between the two is the feel - the TPE feels soft and rubbery, while the PVC feels hard and smooth. The feel of the TPE cable is quite unusual, unlike any other cable I have.

It definitely stands out - I have no other cables that looks anything like it. This cable will definitely not get lost in my bag.The reason for getting either the PVC or TPE APLWL cable is the color. It's not a lot more than most cables, and the color makes it easy to pick out in a bag filled with other cables. Especially this one.Normally, for charging, the longer the cable, the greater the loss. Since USB is only 5V, and the wires usually very thin, the resistance adds up.

I recently purchased a PortaPow USB Power Monitor, so I could tell how much current is flowing through the cable.Apparently the most power hungry device I have, a Nexus tablet, would only charge at 1.1A. I tried different cables and chargers and the results are identical. So I can only report that this cable performs flawlessly at 1.1A.

"This is a great set of screwdrivers with just the right sizes for probably 95% of your around the house tasks needing either a flat or Philips head. The black oxide tips really do seem to help with the grip. Despite another reviewer's claim, I did find these heads to be magnetic and easily hold the screw. I'm attaching a photo showing me holding it vertically head down with a screw magnetically attached. The two smallest sizes are very handy for those hard to reach screws like those tiny ones for battery compartments.The holes in the handle serve multiple purposes: you can use them to hang them for storage. You can also put another driver through the whole to get better leverage and grip on hard to budge screws. Between that and the oxide tip, you should experience much less slippage (and stripping of screw heads). The grip is comfortable and the bulbous end is a good fit in any hands. I would highly recommend this set, especially to a new homeowner/renter who needs a decent affordable set of screwdrivers to serve most purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAOC568VWT2BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00931QH40#wasThisHelpful","RAOC568VWT2BY","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Zippo 12-hour hand warmer is a must have for anyone who spends a decent amount of time outdoors in cold winter months. While it touts being able to last up to 12 hours, I've actually been able to get even more hours out of it. It is slim, easily fits in a pocket and stays very warm. Here's how it works:-Pop off the chrome upper half lid-Take off the catalytic burner unit-Fill with lighter fluid (sold separately)-Put the catalytic burner back on-Light - Once lit, put back on the lid and put into the fabric bag.I also had a previous version, which came with a different lighter fluid refilling reservoir. It had a wider fill opening, making it more susceptible for spills. They have improved that design. While it works very well, there are a couple things I don't like about it: it is sort of a hassle to get it filled, lit, and ready to go. It takes me a couple minutes, so I have to make sure I leave enough time to get it filled and lit before I go outside. Also, if you aren't careful, it is easy to spill fluid as you are filling the warmer's reservoir. Furthermore, it is sometimes tough to tell exactly when the catalytic burner is lit. You can easily tell if you are in complete darkness, but in the light, it is harder to tell. Despite the hassle, I still love having this hand warmer and use it frequently.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AKS524QQVDXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HLGTL2#wasThisHelpful","R2AKS524QQVDXE","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't get pedicures often, so it's a special treat to pamper my feet now & then. They do get pretty atrocious when ignored for too long! I get nasty calluses on the sides of my big toes and around the perimeter of my heels, because of the way I walk.Rough skin isn't my only foot issue - I've also suffered from plantar fasciitis for years because of large heel spurs growing underneath. After orthotics, special shoes, and other external methods didn't help, I had surgery 5 weeks ago to remove one of the heel spurs. It is healing slowly, and because I can't afford to slow down and rest as much as I need to, it still aches and hurts a lot. My doctor has been giving me ultrasound treatments to reduce inflammation and pain, but I only see him every couple of weeks at most. Much to my VERY happy surprise, this device feels almost the same as the ultrasound vibrations at the doctor's office! And provides almost as much relief! And, I can use it every day to help relieve the pain - more than once, if I want! The brush attachments & sonic waves, combined with soothing lotions, feel absolutely wonderful!As a pedicure device, it has some limitations. When I ordered this gadget, I thought the brush/file head would spin instead of just vibrate (I don't read descriptions very thoroughly, I admit). I suspect that spinning would be more effective when it comes to sanding down the calluses, though you would go through the textured pads really fast. As it is, the device emits a subtle vibration (at 3 varying speeds) & you move the brush in a circular motion to gently rub down the rough areas. It provides more control this way, I think, though it still wears down the textured pads pretty quickly and I can't find replacements at Amazon! On my first try, I did use it for a long time on various settings, and my feet felt REALLY nice. It is much more gentle than the Ped-Egg (OUCH - whoops), and provides more subtle & soft results. My feet have stayed very soft for days.The device is indeed water resistant in the shower, though it's a pretty awkward way to scrub your feet while standing up (I did not try in a sit-down bath). I really liked it best outside the bath, when using the brush attachment to apply a soothing peppermint cream to my poor aching feet. Using the different speeds and a circular motion, the sonic vibrations & softening lotion felt FANTASTIC. I could barely walk on my sore post-surgical foot after a long day of painting walls & moving furniture, and after an hour with this gadget my foot felt as good as new! The very-stiff brush bristles are kind of hard to clean, when it comes to lotion, but it's all worth it!As a pedicure kit, it's okay. It's not a fast process for softening & pampering your feet, but you're supposed to be relaxing right? What I would REALLY like to see with this device/kit, is a) extra sanding discs for the calluses because they wear down too quickly, and b) some kind of case for all these attachments. Between the plug, dock, brush, brush heads, and covers, you get 7 different pieces and no way to really store them together unless you keep the original box. Even a cloth drawstring bag would be handy; I just know I'm going to lose at least 3 of these pieces within a few weeks. Because of these issues, I wanted to give it only 3 stars, but those sonic vibrations left my foot pain-free when nothing else helped! As a post-surgical healing aid, I'd give it 10 stars out of 5! But I understand, that's not exactly a common issue, and more people just want a quick and pleasant pedicure. The other reviewers make some valid points on that issue, but I adore this thing and am going to use it a lot!Also, the loud BEEPS when it wants you to switch feet are kind of unnecessary, and they scare the crap out of my dogs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YIXQ2NM9EBW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CE2JVC#wasThisHelpful","R2YIXQ2NM9EBW4","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The setup was easy with the wizard and most of your standard router settings are easy to find and change. I had no trouble finding and setting up the guest network and security. I was up and running within 10 minutes of getting it out of the box. I've never had a router where you could purposefully limit the range, which this router has - good for a dorm room or small dedicated office where you don't want the signal broadcast everywhere. Another feature I didn't realize I wanted was the ability to turn off the LEDs.Overall I have very few gripes about the router. There does seem to be fewer settings available for tweaking, compared with my old TP Link. My former routers (TP Link & D Link) also did a better job with giving descriptions and explanations within the settings you are tweaking. This one doesn't have as much documentation embedded on those settings screens. The wi-fi analytics tool app I found pretty much useless. It lets you analyze the available wi-fi networks and things like channel strength. However, it isn't a full fledged router settings manager and doesn't show you any sort of network map of the devices connected. At this price, I would hope there would be more options for managing the router from your smartphone.Overall, this is a very powerful router with a very wide range. It would just be nice if it had a few more options and documentation within the settings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIWX4HV3UFIWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013H4AVT0#wasThisHelpful","RIWX4HV3UFIWC","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think I read the description very well, because I was expecting it to be about a foot long & maybe 6"" tall at most. Imagine my shock when the UPS man came strolling up the walk with such an enormous (yet not very heavy) box! This dog is so big! Stands 15"" tall and stretches to a full 3 feet; it is pretty substantially long when not stretched, too. The slinky dog in Toy Story struck me as looking like a hard plastic toy (I don't know if that was intentional, or if it was just my imagination), and this one is very soft, huggable, and just delightful! Looks just like the dog in the movie, to me, but really big and really soft - all good things!I think any kid would go crazy for this, even if they aren't a huge Toy Story fan (if that's possible). Even if you consider it just a stuffed animal, it is pretty unique! I never imagined a slinky would be so soft and hug-worthy! What kid wouldn't love a big soft dog that stretches halfway across your bedroom?I don't know if this will ever be considered a ""collectible"" for Disney/Pixar enthusiasts, but for the adult collector this would make a really fun conversation piece. The surprisingly large size makes it so playful, and I think his spring-shaped belly would be a fun way to display some of your smaller Woodys & Buzz Lightyears. Maybe I'm not normal because at 43 I still like stuffed animals, but to me this seems like a good gift for a Toy Story fan of any age!Amazon needs to figure out something different for shipping though, to avoid damage to the original box. Despite being all alone in a generously-sized box with a lot of crinkled kraft paper for padding, the original display box had gotten crushed somewhere along the way so it has very crumpled corners & sides, plus a big rip in the top of the cardboard. Obviously you can't really ""break"" a stuffed animal, but with the holidays coming, gifts look nicer if the box hasn't gotten all beat up first. Kids probably don't care anyway, but I prefer to give a new-looking gift!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EVG1KSD0TM3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHVOL14#wasThisHelpful","R2EVG1KSD0TM3V","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is so awesome, it's ridiculous. Though it has clearly been designed for a frequent traveler, or maybe even a professional coder who hauls a lot of tech around the office, it also suits my different needs rather perfectly. I make things for art/craft fairs, and have to haul a lot of very random, awkward things to every show, and it has been wonderful!It is extremely durable, even internally - it can take the punishment of a metal cashbox full of change without so much as a scratch, even while the other section is extremely overstuffed with snacks to share with show visitors. The side pockets are the perfect shape to lug bottled water or pop (in bottles or cans), and the front pocket has little sections for wallet basics as well as a surprisingly roomy area for the other essentials so I don't have to bring my purse if I don't want to! There's even a flatter zip pocket above it that is the perfect size for my phone, to keep it from knocking around into things the other crowded areas (also allows one-step access to grab my phone, score!).Today I took it with me to run errands on my bicycle. I had to drop off a fragile package first, which was well-padded in one of the primary compartments. Next, I stopped at the grocery store for a few things...but apparently I was hungry because I bought a LOT OF THINGS. Again I was able to cram everything into this amazing backpack without so much as bruising one apple! It was packed pretty tight (I was real hungry, no joke) but I still carried it home on my bicycle quite comfortably.I can really see where this would be perfect for travel. It has a perfectly-sized, well-protected compartment for a laptop, though I don't carry one I would feel very comfortable shoving my iPad in there. I also don't carry a lot of files or briefs (though a sketchbook and pencils are not out of the question) and while they would fit well in there, it will also carry all my clothes and toiletries MUCH better than the typical Jansport backpack that I might normally lug with me for a weekend trip. Not just more heavy-duty (and attractive), but it has myriad pockets inside the myriad pockets, to fit all sorts of weird items you might need for whatever it is you do. Also, it has a padded sleeve on the back which makes it easy & convenient to slide on the handle of a rolling bag for travel.It looks elegant but simple - you can see the quality, but it's not so ostentatious that it would automatically attract thieves. I'm very proud to carry it around, but not so deeply concerned about watching it every second for theft like I might for a designer handbag that cost the same amount. Maybe I'm just being foolish, but it doesn't trade looks for function. It simply looks like a very well-made, high-quality, heavy-duty backpack.I will say, if there is a drawback (other than the price, which is fairly steep), it is not only heavy-duty, it's also very heavy. This is to be expected with something that has so many great pockets and so much padding for your delicate electronic devices, but it might not be something you want to take on long hikes unless you're really used to a good amount of weight before adding anything to it. It's really not a huge drawback, and not very surprising when you take into account all the things it can haul, but it's heavy enough to merit a mention.Still give it 5 stars. I absolutely love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R178CHVG69GHZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XC616XO#wasThisHelpful","R178CHVG69GHZI","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a camper, which I've been slowly decorating in a vintage tiki style. Previously, I had some straw-style Hawaiian-themed placemats that were very cute, BUT...one of them got mildew after rain came in the dinette window, and the other got ruined when somebody (me) spilled chocolate milk all over it. These are not just a perfect replacement, but MUCH more suited to the task of camping!The look is very nice - they look like a bamboo/grasscloth with just the right texture, so in my camper they echo the tiki style. But, I can imagine them being very versatile for any room; they're really a neutral color that will look fine in any decor. The texture feels similar to the nubby straw placemats I had before, but with a slightly more rubbery feel. This is fantastic in my camper because they a) won't slip around on the dinette table, and b) they will REPEL moisture (in the form of water or chocolate milk) instead of soaking it in and getting ruined. Honestly, what was I thinking getting fragile, non-water-resistant anything for camping? I'd feel very comfortable using these outdoors as well as inside. Even on a gross campground picnic table, they will keep the food neat & tidy and easily wipe clean after a meal.LOVE them. I'd recommend them for any home, but especially for any camper!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VP4CAJPIKGJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TS9Q19I#wasThisHelpful","R2VP4CAJPIKGJN","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Considering the price of this unit, I think you can get much better results from one of the many other options available. This unit touts its versatility as a 5 in 1 device. However, I found the open grill/griddle positions to be close to useless, due to the amount of time it took to cook. I had to turn the temperature up to sear and it still took me over 20 minutes to cook pancakes. I tried doing burgers and it took equally long. I placed my hand about a cm up from the grill on sear and I could have held it there all day. It only felt like it got moderately hot. The grease collection does not function well either, since the grill is level. Also, I wish the grease collection cups had a way of locking in place, instead of just being separate and possibly sliding out of position.The plates themselves were very easy to clean with the ceramic coating. I was nervous since the grill ridges were very deep - I was afraid food would get stuck and I wouldn't be able to clean it, but that was not the case.If you were planning on using this as a panini press, you might be okay. That functioned alright. The size of the plates seemed bigger than other presses I've tried. You could easily fit two large sandwiches on it - so that's a plus. However, I would avoid this if you are truly looking for a versatile device that can also function as a griddle. There are too many other options on the market that function as a panini press better for less.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPWU6XL4KG6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BHEBVA#wasThisHelpful","R2LPWU6XL4KG6U","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the best backpacks I have used as far as quality and design is considered. It has all the features you would expect from a premium backpack, plus more. Most notably, I love having the crush proof compartment for delicate items. I feel much more secure putting my glasses, phone, watch and other more fragile items. It has lots of small pockets in smartly designed places, including a vertical zipping small front pocket. It is also designed to be used as a daypack for outdoor enthusiasts, meaning you can insert a water bladder if you want. There are also convenient side pockets for water bottles. It features a main large compartment, two mid-size compartments, then the crushproof area and a front small pocket. And each of those compartments has sub-compartments within.It may be slightly undersized if you are looking for a pack to carry all your electronics and a lot of books or papers. I think it can do one well, but not both. I can fit a very large laptop, plus a tablet in there, and have room for all my cords. However, there isn't a ton of extra space beyond that. It fits very comfortably with wide straps, a padded back, and torso straps.Overall, this is a very well crafted, designed, and constructed backpack, suitable for most, but not all uses.Pros: High Quality Zippers  Lots of compartments  Crush proof pocket for glasses, phonesCons: May be too small if you need to fit in a lot of electronics and books","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REYRUQ8W0VD4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8KBCKM#wasThisHelpful","REYRUQ8W0VD4M","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are awesome. I make some items to sell at a local consignment shop and usually make my own tags, but these seemed so much cuter for my Halloween designs. The size is PERFECT for the small circular stickers I got from Vistaprint for my logo, and I used small rectangle price stickers for the other side. The tags are a good thickness that won't rip or bend easily while still being lightweight, and the little hole at the top is perforated but not removed (so you will have tiny black dots all over the place after assembling them). It comes with two 50ft lengths of jute twine that can be cut into whatever size you need for each tag. For my Halloween products, the jute added a really nice touch!! This would be cool for a rustic, homey-looking holiday or birthday gift wrap too.I thought the quality was awesome for the price. You get a ton of them, and I like the fact that you can cut the twine to variable lengths. I like everything about this product.

"Very, VERY soft!!! One side has the textured pattern seen in the photo, and the other is just a ridiculously soft plush faux fur. The textured side is extremely soft too, but the other is like, a level of softness that feels almost otherworldly. This blanket is going to be so nice and warm in the winter!! The pillow forms didn't quite fit our pillows (our pillows were slightly too large) but we still managed to cram them in there anyway - made for very hard, overstuffed pillows! Not the covers, which are insanely soft, just the loft because we were too lazy to buy new pillows and tried to fit 20"" of pillow into an 18"" cover. Covers have a zip closure, but it's an invisible zipper, which means it's hard to find and grasp but will not leave uncomfortable zipper marks on your face if you fall asleep on that side of the pillow.The diamond pattern as shown in the photo is actually much more subtle in person; it's more of a texture with a slightly lighter thread color outlining the diamonds. It doesn't look like white outlines at all, just adds a little something extra to the look and feel of the material. It's a very rich purple though, so you have to really like purple! The blanket is a bit thinner than it appears in the photo, which is actually good because this soft faux-fur material can get mighty hot after a while - you definitely would not want it to be any thicker or heavier! The blanket is a nice big size too, plenty of room for snuggling with a friend under there. Much bigger than your average ""throw"" which generally leaves your toes sticking out.The way it comes packaged is PERFECT for gift-giving. I suspect they had this in mind for the holidays and packaged it accordingly (it would be great for a dorm room or housewarming too, but it is wrapped with wide red ribbon that vaguely implies ""Christmas""). It comes all folded into a tight rectangle with cardboard inside to keep it from collapsing, and has ribbon looped through a shiny cardboard label detailing the materials, washing instructions, etc. It really does look nice! I could imagine it sitting atop a small pile of fully-wrapped presents, just as is without any additional wrapping. Then the recipient could wrap themselves up in the soft blanket while opening the other gifts! Sounds like a very merry holiday indeed.Pros: SUPER soft, blanket is an excellent size & perfect thickness, diamond pattern/texture is very subtle & not at all tacky.Cons: Really must make sure the recipient likes purple! And you may have to work out a blanket-sharing schedule with your pets, because they like super soft faux fur just as much as you do.Draw: I don't know if the pillow forms are really necessary. How many people want to match their pillows to their throw blankie? Maybe a lot, I don't know. I wound up taking my too-large pillows out and letting the dogs cuddle with the empty pillow covers. That way they don't get too possessive of the large blanket & I can have it all for myself!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I47G3SKQ5HV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131LJ7NA#wasThisHelpful","R2I47G3SKQ5HV5","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems like a perfect food for small dogs - nutritious, tiny kibble (good for problematic mouths like Pekingese & Pug, or elderly dogs), it is a flavor my dogs usually go nuts for...I don't know why they didn't like it. I thought they would go bananas for it! I've tried Nutro brands with dogs I've had in the past, and they liked it. Maybe mine are just hopelessly spoiled after having tried AvoDerm, they always eat that with no problems. This Nutro, they ate some of it but all 3 of them left a good portion in their bowls. And since I mix their dinner with a bit of canned wet food, these tiny kibbles seem to become one with the bowl when abandoned until the next day's meal - very hard to clean out the leftovers.I am not giving this a bad rating because I seriously believe this is very good dog food. It's very healthy, full of natural ingredients & excellent nutrition, I trust the brand, and I think the kibble size is perfect for small breeds or elderly dogs. My dogs just didn't seem to want to eat it, and they refused to explain why. I'm going to say they're very spoiled, and there's nothing wrong with the Nutro!

"I still recall the day I upgraded my 20GB Xbox 360 HD with a 100GB HD and thinking, ""There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again."" Fast forward 4 years, lots of Rock Band DLC and the ability to store full games to the HD and I find myself at about 90% full. Enter the Seagate 2TB drive. Now I can have that feeling again of, ""There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.""This Seagate game drive seems to be a pretty typical 2TB hard drive, priced similar to other 2TB drives, but with officially licensed Xbox One or Xbox 360 compatibility and design. When you consider the basic Xbox One 500GB console is currently priced around $350 and the newer 1 TB model is about $400, you could get the 500GB model and one of these drives (currently $100) and spend about $450 and have a total of 2.5 TB of storage. Basically, an extra 1.5 TB for an extra $50, which isn't a bad deal. Of course, you have to consider your current usage and potential future storage needs.The main thing I think it lacks is a little more in the way of instructions for transferring data from the console to the drive. While it wasn't that difficult for me to figure out, it might be a little more challenging for a parent who is not as up to speed on how these work. Especially considering it is an officially licensed Xbox product, it was surprising there was little more than a short pamphlet describing the drive's features included. I wish it would have gone into more detail about how it handles in-game DLC licensing content vs game content. It was not the most user friendly in that regard. I finished transferring data and wasn't positive if I was going to be able to play with DLC once it was moved to the drive (I was). A little more clarity in what it would and would not transfer would have been helpful as well as explanation on what you need to do if you use it on an Xbox 360, then upgrade to the Xbox One. I plan to do this in a few weeks, so I may update the review if I hit any other snags in that process.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QEQK2UHCZSFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01065S79E#wasThisHelpful","R2QEQK2UHCZSFZ","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been taking Viva Labs CLA for almost a month now. While I haven't been noticing any significant weight loss I can solely attribute to the supplement, I have noticed these Omega-6s did leave me feeling full for longer, even when taken with relatively small meals. They are the same large size as the largest fish oil pills I have taken - so expect large pills. However, they did go down easy and you don't get the fish burp after taste like you would with the fish oil. To gain the full effect, they recommend taking 1-2 of these three times daily. Taking 2 of these three times daily seems excessive, unless you are obese.

"The Stanley Classic Vacuum bottle is a decent recreation of an American classic. I do not have another original ""US made"" Stanley thermos to compare this to. However, I can say I am reasonably pleased with its ability to retain heat and cold. It works better than a comparable Thermos brand bottle and a large hot water carafe I have. I placed ice in it and 5 days later there was still solid ice in it. I also put hot liquid in it and it was still hot enough for my liking by the end of the day. If you can fill it with hot water before pouring in your drink of choice, I think you will notice a better heat retention. The only issue I have with it is the handle is very stiff and completely made of plastic.

"SUPER tight and sturdy - I think it is a fine product, IF you have a very large, strong dog to run with. I have small dogs, but one of them (a Tibetan Spaniel) pulls on the leash all the time so I thought this might be a good way to walk her. The bungee is so tight that she can't stretch it at all, and because of that she's always running right next to my foot - this is a recipe for big time tripping over each other and face-planting the sidewalk.Bottom line is, might be great for your big strong Rottweiler, Pit Bull, etc, but this is not going to work for small dogs.

If you need very light support for inside a shoe, it might be somewhat useful, but if you have painful plantar fasciitis, this won't do anything. I have sport-fit athletic socks that offer more support than this product.I don't know if this was a fluke, but they came packaged in a thin plastic bag (like a sandwich bag) with no labeling.

"I have toy dogs (a Pekingese, Pomeranian, and a Tibetan Spaniel), and these kibbles are just a tad too big for them on some days. I try to mix it with some wet food with lots of gravy to soften them up a bit. I don't know if it's the size or the flavor, but two of them (the Peke & the Tibbie) can really take it or leave it - some days they will cheerfully eat their dinner, other days they sniff at it and then look at me like ""Can I have something else?"" Ironically, the Pomeranian is the only one who truly loves it, and she only has 5 teeth so I didn't think she'd be able to chew the large kibbles at all!It does seem to be very healthy for them, though they don't have any particular allergies or conditions so they don't really NEED a specialty food. I haven't noticed any adverse effects; their digestion works great on this food (when they decide to eat it, of course). I probably won't buy again because they just don't seem to like it very much so I'm always scraping sticky old kibble out of their bowls the next morning. They all LOVE AvoDerm (toy dog formula, chicken flavor) so I'll switch back when this bag is gone. They like this CORE food well enough so I don't have to donate it to charity, but not enough to buy again.Doesn't mean that it's not a good quality food, just a matter of taste.

With this product, they've gone the extra step to provide a mountable base onto which you can attach artwork, chalkboard, or dry-erase board.The art itself sits about 1"" from the wall, which gives it some depth. Additionally, there is an optional riser to allow you to position art even further from the wall, which allows for the possibility to overlap and create some unique setups.It is super easy to install - especially with the integrated level within the base! You don't have to worry about putting any level lines on your wall. The instructions are clear, with words and pictures. There are also examples of other artwork you can choose to easily slap on the base. I would expect you can just buy different artwork (and not pay for the base again), but I'm not seeing where that is a product alone. It would be great to be able to switch out the artwork based on your mood or the season, especially since they make it so easy. This will be 5 stars once I see the ability to buy other art tiles w/o the base.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JPQ94O4EX9RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9Q7XCS#wasThisHelpful","R3JPQ94O4EX9RZ","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For making free-standing lace embroidery, this is The Stuff. It feels like a thick sheet of plastic when you hoop it, and holds even heavy lace designs very well. It takes a fair amount of rinsing to remove it all (you can tell when it's completely gone because the lace will not be sticky anymore) and the soaking bowl gets kind of slimy afterward! But all worth it because the final designs are beautiful and never fall apart. I never have gaps where the embroidery has pulled apart when I use this. That's not to say that thread never gets snagged and messes up, but you'll find that happens occasionally on pretty much any project if you sew/embroider a lot.Previously, I had been using a fabric-style stabilizer for making lace, which tended to have some problem areas after soaking to remove the stabilizer. The fabric style is easier to wash away & the final product feels softer against sensitive skin, but so many of my designs had parts that became disconnected or didn't catch, that I had to spend hours repairing them and it wasn't worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10P2KTJG2SYXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010ESB88#wasThisHelpful","R10P2KTJG2SYXR","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are awesome. They look nice - fancy enough to be part of a design, not just a hidden attachment. And the magnets are pretty powerful. DO use some interfacing inside your fabric when attaching these, or the magnet may pull your project apart too much. Actually you should use some interfacing anyway, but you may want to step up to a medium or heavy interfacing instead of lightweight, just in case.GREAT deal, much cheaper than I've found in craft supply stores for closures that didn't even look as nice as this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25UA3DJ0Z8IYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NS6J7PW#wasThisHelpful","R25UA3DJ0Z8IYE","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a FitFlop devotee since they first came out with the thick-soled flip-flops so many years ago; they hug my problem feet so nicely and are the only shoes that don't leave me limping in pain the next day. I've since purchased the house slippers (pink & fuzzy!) and winter ankle boots (people say I look like an elf in them), along with several more pairs of flip-flops! I have plantar fasciitis, arthritis, and some other painful undiagnosed issues, so most shoes hurt. Not these!All my previous pairs of FitFlops have been pretty wide and not super feminine, so I was VERY surprised at how dainty and light these shoes are. Absolutely delighted, to tell the truth! I had ordered as kind of a compromise-shoe for summer, something that wouldn't look too terrible with a pretty summer dress but wouldn't hurt my aching feet even if I took some long walks. But these are seriously CUTE!!! I actually WANT to wear them with everything because they look great, it's not a compromise at all!!The fit is fantastic. The soles are light as a feather, but still hug my foot to keep me well supported. This helps with my foot pain as well as a tired back after spending 8 hours on my feet in a marble-floored retail store. Shockingly, they are actually super comfortable right out of the box, with no breaking-in period! After about 10 hours of continuous wear without socks (all standing or walking, very little sitting), I did notice a little rubbing on my right heel, but that's a lot less than I expected after spending the last 6 months in thick socks. No rubbing on the sides of my feet, near my toes, around the strap, nowhere. Oddly, my feet weren't very sweaty either - I don't know if they have wicking material in there or what, because my feet usually get pretty gross without socks. They feel WONDERFUL! I could not be happier with these shoes. If they made them in fashion colors, I would buy 65 pairs of them. Even though they are pretty spendy, I admit. I'd sell a kidney. Worth it.They are quite a bit more narrow than the traditional FitFlops, but my feet are *average* (not narrow or wide) and they fit perfectly. If you have an extra wide foot, they may not fit you quite as well as some of the traditional FitFlop designs. But for average & narrow feet, I think this is a perfect, perfect, perfect shoe. And so much cuter than orthopedic sneakers!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXJ7VHJIET6I4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M35BJE6#wasThisHelpful","RXJ7VHJIET6I4","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The AeroGarden 3SL has one major thing going for it, compared to all the other ""self-contained"" growing apparatuses: SIZE. I believe the SL in the model number refers to slim. It is just that and fits pretty easily on a kitchen countertop and underneath upper cabinets. The upper arm extends, so it could start off fitting under our taller upper cabinets. As the plants grow, you easily raise the arm up and it still fits under our shorter upper cabinets.Another critical review of the product cites the proprietary bulb as a drawback and that you can easily make this product DIY for cheaper. That reviewer is correct. However, the proprietary bulb is what allows the top section to be so slim. And not everyone wants to make their own. If you just don't feel like making it yourself, then this may be for you. The device has a handy fertilizer reminder light that goes on every two weeks to remind you to add fertilizer. Instructions for setup were clear. The main disappointment with this herb garden is the flimsiness of the constructions. The extendable arm feels very weak. The housing for the bulb is also not very solid. Be careful around this if you are dealing with big heavy pots and pans. I could see  someone accidentally taking the top off.This herb garden may be good for the apartment dweller or someone with limited counter space. However, just know you are paying for a kind of cheap bunch of plastic pieces.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZB7GRS8U6RJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PY3JQSA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZB7GRS8U6RJY","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using this product for about a week, my asthma got a whole lot worse. At first I thought I had caught a respiratory virus, but in general I felt fine - other than having trouble breathing. It continued to get worse & worse, so that even the lightest amount of exercise (a 10-min walk with my dogs, going up a staircase) would leave me gasping for breath. It felt like trying to breathe through a very clogged filter, or at times felt like I was trying to just sip air through a thin straw. I nearly called my doctor to get checked for pneumonia, even though I had no fever - I just couldn't breathe!There are no warnings on the product literature that I could find, but a couple of internet searches revealed that Garcinia can interfere with the effectiveness of asthma medication. I take an inhaler twice daily to keep my asthma under control, and occasionally use an albuterol inhaler for acute breathing trouble, or before exercise to ward off a possible attack. I've had it all my life, and it doesn't usually keep me from exercising even if I forget a dose or two of my daily medication, but while taking HCActive I was having terrible trouble breathing all the time. I even had to sleep sitting up, or else be awakened in the middle of the night by an asthma attack.So, I didn't get to give this a very lengthy trial, I had to quit in order to get my asthma back under control. In the short time I did take it, I didn't notice any drop in appetite or change in metabolism, and I obviously could not exercise because I could barely breathe - just changing into my workout clothes made me winded. I definitely didn't lose any weight; I think I actually gained a pound or two. After discontinuing use, it took about 4 days for my breathing to get back to almost normal. Maybe I would have seen more effectiveness if I'd been able to take it longer, but not being able to exercise makes me doubt it. Honestly, I never gave ""appetite suppressant"" much respect because I eat more out of habit or boredom than hunger, but a few months ago I tried a different product that actually worked - I sincerely WANTED to snack but was just too darn full! So, now I know that my appetite is capable of being suppressed, but while on HCActive, my appetite returned with full force. I don't think anything about HCActive worked for me. I have read it can be very effective at increasing your fat burn during exercise, but if you can't exercise because you can't breathe, that becomes a moot point.If you don't have asthma, you may have good luck with this, I really don't know. But if you do have asthma and take daily medication to control it, please be warned that this could potentially be very dangerous.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZK2V8U4CUF5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDQZSBY#wasThisHelpful","RZK2V8U4CUF5S","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll probably only get this brand of tape in the future. It works so well. It can probably be accused of being too sticky - which is good. This is the tape to use when you need a real, strong duct tape. The two pack comes individually wrapped, so you can be sure it won't be dried out when you need it. I didn't have any issues with tearing it with just my hands. I would suggest also storing it with some sort of plastic wrapping it.

"My little dogs (a Pekingese & a Tibetan Spaniel) absolutely LOVE this food. I mix their dry food with a little canned at dinner time, and they usually try to eat around the kibble as much as possible - not with this food! They both station themselves at their bowls and barely take a breath until it's gone! This bag of lamb-formula also included a sample of turkey-formula which they loved even MORE!I will say...it seems to create a very, um, robust digestive situation. They've gone from making 1-2 healthy poops per day on Pedigree right up to 3 very LARGE poops per dog, per day. It all seems quite healthy, it's just - surprising! I don't know if it has a lot of fiber, or is just easy to digest, or what.

"Bottle Battle!!!!Bottle Battle by Zune is a new, fun game you can play outside (or even inside, if you have a large enough space and aren't worried about a stray flying disc breaking something). Please watch the manufacturers video on this product page for a quick and simple explanation of how it's played. I like that all the components come in their own carrying case, with straps to hold each one in its place. Set up was very easy - it only took about 5 minutes in total. The components are a decent quality build, too. The metal poles have numbers and a small plastic slider, to act as a scorekeeping mechanism. This was a smart design choice.If you like these types of games, but are getting tired of tossing bean bags, big washers, or two golf balls connected with a string, then give Bottle Battle a try for a new challenge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGE1ZHC1775U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6GOYMM#wasThisHelpful","R3FGE1ZHC1775U","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our latest in a series of many countertop grills, and so far one of the best we've ever had! Our most recent (and previous favorite) was the Cuisinart version, which we used for years with no problems (& will probably keep for our camper). This new Foreman has a slightly larger grill area than the Cuisinart, which is nice for toasting sandwiches on extra-wide bread or grilling more/larger pieces of meat, fish, poultry, etc. The floating hinge is VERY large, and accommodates the way the ceramic plate edges seem to ""surround"" whatever you're cooking, but feels very loose at times, like it is about to slide right off the food! Of course, it doesn't (or hasn't yet), but can be a bit startling!The best feature is the ceramic - it heats up super fast and cooks the food much faster too! It doesn't stick to food at all, even fish, which tends to stick to everything. This also means cleanup is a breeze! The clip mechanism that attaches the plate to the grill takes some getting used to, but otherwise I love these ceramic plates a LOT. I could feel the fast-heating appeal when I washed a fully-cooled plate under hot water and it got as hot as the water almost immediately! No wonder they cook the food so fast! Grilled cheese sandwiches used to take almost 10 minutes on the Cuisinart, on this Foreman they take 3-4 minutes tops (and the bread is perfect crispy with nice grill marks).Also love the fact that you can set the specific temp and set a timer right on the grill, plus it has general temp/time guidelines printed directly on the grill itself. This is GREAT because if they were on a separate piece of paper I would lose it instantly and never remember what settings are correct! So far I've used their advice for temps & times and everything has cooked just perfectly.The waffle plates are not ceramic, so they're a little tougher to clean (also because of all the little waffle holes, haha), but it's really not too bad. Also they cook a little slower than ceramic, but that's okay. Unless you're making two huge waffles for one person, they're kind of hard to separate once they're cooked! But, we haven't had a waffle iron in years so this is a really fun little feature. However, there is one problem with making waffles on this, and that's the ""lie flat"" feature.The ""adjustable height"" feature has two settings: up or down (incline or flat). Maybe it's just our particular grill, but the ""flat"" position actually puts it at a slight decline angle. This is a huge problem for waffles, which have to be cooked flat, because the liquid waffle mix oozes down the back of the grill and makes a huge mess. The back of the grill is NOT non-stick, doesn't come apart, and involves a lot of nooks & crannies that are nearly impossible to clean thoroughly. This could have been solved if the adjuster-knob had a couple of intermediary settings instead of just two, so instead we're experimenting with propping the back of it up on some magazines to make it level. So far we have not succeeded in finding the best angle, because waffle mix drips out the back every time. I'm not using the flat setting for anything else, even though you're supposed to use it for sandwiches, because I can only imagine trying to clean butter out of there! Yes, my grilled cheese slides off when the grill is inclined, but I'm always there to catch it.This is really the only problem with the grill, otherwise I love it! And seeing all the other 5-star reviews, I'm wondering if I just got a bad one and all the others actually lie flat. Don't let it hold you back if you're thinking of getting this grill, the ceramic plates & other features make it worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLMZZJI8BT9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYK18O#wasThisHelpful","R1GLMZZJI8BT9Z","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Setup: Very simple. It walks you through the process using a quick start menu. Of course, there are lots of other options to set up the router and the zones exactly how you want. I also really like how on the admin screens, it shows a split screen with the settings on the left and a sort of help screen on the right - for people like me who know a bit about networks, but is not a professional IT person, and still want to tweak the settings.App: I've just started playing around with the TP-Link Tether app. I like how it displays all devices connected and gives the option of renaming them right within the app. However, there are limits on what sorts of settings on the router itself you can control. You can turn on/off parental controls, turn on/off and rename each wireless channel and guest networks. Those guest networks on/off toggles are handy to have on a phone app, in case you have guests and don't want to share your password.Range: If you are going from a wireless a/b/g/n to an AC router, you will probably notice an expansion in range. Prior to this one, I had a D-Link AC750 router. I think that one actually gave me a slightly wider range, though I plan to experiment more with placement to see if it improves. So far, I've had some spotty connection stability at corners of my house where I didn't used to have a problem with the D-Link router.Speed: No issues here. I seem to be able to maximize all my up/down speeds from my ISP. I have over a dozen different devices connected at once and can easily wirelessly stream HD video to multiple devices. The quality of stream from my Slingbox seemed slightly poor, though I can't confirm it is a result of this router. More testing is needed.Other features: 2 USB ports should allow for file/media sharing from an external hard drive to the devices on your network. Also, it should allow for connecting a printer for print sharing on your network. My D-Link router does not have these features and I wish it did.Overall, you can probably upgrade to a cheaper AC router and get the benefits of dual channel support and wider range. However, if you are looking for the USB ports, this may be a good option for you. Also, the app capabilities are limited, but what it does do, it does well and makes it easy. I really like this TP-Link router and if I can improve its placement to help with its range, I will probably bump the review up to 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E1CVKIWTK2VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZFG6QS#wasThisHelpful","R2E1CVKIWTK2VA","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This doesn't seem to position right into the palm of my hand the way it seems like it should, but the low height overall really lets you get excellent leverage when scrubbing. Some of the dishes that have not cleaned well with my regular dish brush (notably our favorite pizza pan, which always gets cheese baked onto it) work really great with this scrubber! It definitely is not abrasive on non-stick surfaces, but removes the gunk pretty easily nonetheless. The drip tray keeps each scrubbing pad fresher longer, and keeps the sink cleaner too.As a few other reviewers have mentioned, the shape doesn't allow for effective corner-scrubbing in square or rectangular pans. Also, if you have something filled pretty deeply with soapy water, prepare to get your arm wet because this guy is short! Those are relatively small complaints, though. For the price this is a really nice little scrubber.

"I like to have a large water vessel nearby throughout the day, and on my nightstand while I sleep, because I like to drink water all the time. After I dropped my last cup and broke it, I thought this sounded like a fun option for adding a bit of flavor to my water. I don't really like the sports-bottle style, and I need a cover & straw because otherwise my cat will stick her head in there!The strainer/divider doesn't seem to sit firmly in the container, and the holes are pretty big, so you kind of have to just keep large chunks or sections of fruit on one side because any pulp will just float through. That being the case, your fruit will have to sit in there for quite a while before it actually flavors the water at all. To get any real flavor, you'll have to squeeze your fruit a bit which means you'll have pulp floating around. That's not a big problem for me, but then - what's the point of the divider?The bigger problem is that the cap is not a screw-on, instead it smushed on with a thin rubbery seal around the top. I never felt it was sealed especially well as it seemed to drift up a millimeter or two every time I closed it. After only about 3 weeks of use (refilling about 3-6 times per day), the rubber seal fell right off into the glass! I tried to put it back on, but it never sealed tightly again. The lid just sat loosely in the container with no tightness at all. I tried using it that way for a few days, until it tipped over and fell off the treadmill, spilling 24 oz of water all over the floor.This is not well made.

"Though apparently my dogs are giving this treat 0 stars, I'll give it 3 because they are pretty finicky. I'm not willing to taste them myself in order to give a really well-rounded review; I love you Amazon, but even I have limits.These seem nice and healthy, they're soft, they're a good size for breaking up if you have one small dog and one smaller dog (such as a Pekingese & a Tibetan Spaniel) - it seems to have all the bases covered. I thought they would love it! But they won't touch it. All the Pekes I've ever known have been picky about their treats, and my current little girl is no different...however my Tibetan will usually eat anything (including fuzz, plastic, and small pieces of yarn). When I passed these out, the Tibetan happily took one, chewed for a moment, then spit it out in her dog bed. The Peke wouldn't even take it, not even the small bite I broke off for her. Sniffed it four or five times, then walked away. If she'd had a ""REJECT"" stamp, the scene would have been complete.I really don't think there's anything wrong with these treats, in fact they seem quite healthy and well-made. Maybe my dogs just don't like lamb? They are more into chicken, as a rule, but I haven't seen them reject anything so firmly in a long time. If your dog likes lamb, maybe this could be a big hit in your house. Or not. Maybe they're more like health food for people; good for you, smells bad, tastes terrible. Pass the bacon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XGF190LXGM8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VRJ2CM#wasThisHelpful","R2XGF190LXGM8R","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The one thing that would make this set perfect would be to include a small plastic tub to be used as a liner for the smallest basket. It is very small, as you can see from the stated dimensions and there are very few things you can fit in there that won't fall out. Any handy person should be able to improvise and find something that would fit. These fit very tightly into my pegboard and don't move around when grabbing things out of the baskets. They are good quality, sturdy, and vinyl coated for protection and durability long term.Pro tip: Put them at the bottom of your pegboard, so the baskets fall under the base of the board. They take up less pegboard space that way.(One weird thing about the shipping from Amazon - they used a slightly smaller box than needed so parts of the largest wire basket had broken the box and were poking out when it arrived. This has nothing to do with the product itself and does not impact my star rating, just something to be aware of).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D82D4BUPQSW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LH0SEY6#wasThisHelpful","R3D82D4BUPQSW5","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The iDevices Kitchen Thermometer does exactly what it says, with the only drawback being the limited connectivity range between the base and your device. I tested it with the probe that plugs into my convection oven and the iDevices thermometer was consistently only about 5-10 degrees higher, which was probably due to the probe not being in exactly the same location. The base is magnetic, and there is a provided metal plate with an adhesive backing. This would allow you to have it be magnetized anywhere. However, I just keep the base stuck to the fridge when not in use. I also like the probe wire wraps and the fact that the two snap together, which makes it easy to store when not in use. The description on amazon indicates it is compatible with Android. However, the box does not specifically indicate Android compatibility and only includes the icon for the Apple App Store and not Google Play Store. I can confirm, there is a compatible app for Android devices. As said before, it would be nicer if the range were a little larger, but I can still comfortably sit in the adjoining living room and monitor the temps from the couch instead of getting up, which is nice for low/slow roasts. Also, if it does disconnect, it quickly reconnected once in range.PROs:-Accurate Dual Probes-Magnetic Base - can stick to fridge when not in use-Probe wire wraps keeps them tidy when not in use - They two wraps click together for easy storage-App available for Apple and Android-Large, bright temp display at the baseCON:-Limited bluetooth range (but quick to reconnect once in range)-App could stand a UI redesign.

"I think my hair might be too short (approx chin-length) to work properly with this gadget, although after reading the other reviews I suspect that might be why I didn't get tangled or stuck in it!  It was a real challenge to get it into the right position to actually pull any of my hair into it, and once it did, it kind of sat around the barrel very loosely. The instructions say that it will beep 3 times when your curl is ready to release, and I never did get it to beep after spending a good 20 minutes curling my whole head - even having timed it for more than 30 seconds on some sections of hair.That said, the curls I was able to get were loose, smooth, and quite pretty. I think it might look nicer (and be a little more user-friendly) if my hair were just a few inches longer, so I'll try it again when I grow it out and update my review if necessary. Based on the other reviews, it doesn't sound like you'd want to use it on super-long hair either because it seems to get stuck inside the barrel mechanism. Maybe medium-length hair is the best for this type of curler.It's very bulky and heavy, and takes up a ton of space in the hair-gadget shelf of the closet. It's also hard to align your hair sections correctly into the small hole where it needs to be for proper winding, especially toward the back of your head, using the mirror image. It doesn't work unless you use fairly small sections of hair, even for wide/loose curls, so it takes quite a lot longer than a regular curling iron. I do like the general look of the curls, but it's such a hassle that this would only be a ""special occasion"" hairstyle for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQJWE8NX3GWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OA431J4#wasThisHelpful","RYQJWE8NX3GWL","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two small 3-yr-old dogs, one Pekingese and one Tibetan Spaniel, and they both LOVE THIS!!! Usually I feed them a bit of Mighty Dog mixed with Pedigree ""Small Dog"" kibble, and they either finish it or not, depending on how hungry they are. After their first meal of Cesar (still mixed with the Pedigree) they now go NUTS at dinnertime every night! They squeal and dance while I'm preparing their bowls, and they finish every last bite. I don't know if we'll ever be able to go back to Mighty Dog now, they love this too much!I think we got the Chicken Stew flavor, rather than the Beef Stew in the photo. My dogs are around 15 lbs each, and they each get approximately half a container of Cesar per day mixed with about 1/2 cup of dry kibble. It looks almost like people food and is very easy to mix with kibble. They particularly like it if every last kibble has a bit of Cesar flavoring on it! I suppose one drawback might be that the containers don't fit with the standard can covers, but the containers are small so it's really not necessary (there aren't many leftovers). The lightweight containers will be easy to transport when we take the dogs camping with us, or when we have to leave them at a kennel. I think we may be long-term converts to this dog food!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6IWA5LADKQIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLSBJOS#wasThisHelpful","R6IWA5LADKQIN","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This magnetic world map puzzle is a great tool to get your kids interested in geography in a fun way. In a globalized society, having knowledge of world geography is essential. The level of detail to this map is appropriate for the targeted age level. The pieces do not neatly align with borders and multiple small countries may be grouped together. This is understandable based on the target age (what 5 year old would not lose Monaco, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Vatican City, etc). What is also great about this map is the artwork. There are graphics to show certain points of interest, which can start other conversations with your kids. For instance, Russia shows a train across the country to represent the Trans-Siberian Railway. You also see the Pyramids of Egypt, the Taj Mahal, the Eiffel Tower, among other landmarks.I would have preferred slightly stronger magnets to hold the pieces in place better, but the overall weight is relatively light, considering the material. (Stronger magnets = more weight/price) I would have also preferred some more accurate borders. However, that would have prevented some of the nice artwork from being as visible as possible. This is priced correctly considering the size and scope. I have seen handmade wooden map puzzles go for over $100, just for a single continent (with country specific pieces - designed for older kids/adults). You might think the price is kind of high for a simple puzzle. However, if you think of it as a tool to start a lifelong interest in geography and consider its material, it is really right in line.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJ4GV2Y6L7TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EYLW98#wasThisHelpful","RRJ4GV2Y6L7TH","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There sure are a mixture of reviews on this product. I have been using it for over two weeks now with absolutely zero problems. There definitely seems to be something going on with customers receiving knock off versions instead of the actual Belkin Mixit. The cable is slightly longer than the stock Lightning to USB cable that comes with your iProduct. It seems to charge at the exact same rate as stock.As far as the negative reviews go, I think the review from Mr Birge is probably accurate.

"The two best things about this soap dispenser: (1) solid, metal, sturdy construction; (2) the whole thing pops off at the top of the sink so it can be easily refilled. It was such a pain to have to unscrew the reservoir under the sink every time to refill the old one. It is slightly pricier than my last soap dispenser, but has a feel like it will last forever. There are plastic pieces in the mechanism and the threads/nut are plastic, designed to be hand-tightened. However, that should require little manipulation and therefore, should leave little to wear and tear.Installation was very simple (once I got my old one out of there, which was a pain). Basically, you just put the top part through the hole, screw in the mounting nut under the sink, then screw in the reservoir.

"The Stiga Evolution Table Tennis Racket is a great step up from more basic rackets with noticeable improvements over basic models in the $20-$40 range. Since this is your primary piece of equipment in the game, I think it is totally worth it to spend a bit more money for an upgraded racket. However, if you are just looking to outfit your rec room with some basic equipment, this is probably overkill.The first thing I noticed about this racket was its balanced heft. It was a bit heavier than my former paddle, but still easily controllable - not too heavy, but not too light. Ball strikes were also much more consistent and controllable. I had much more reliable returns, regardless of where on the bat face the ball hit. Be prepared for a bit of a learning curve if you are going from a basic racket to this one. It is taking some time to get used to the speed and spin, but that will come in time. I am getting a bit more speed than my 5-ply comparison racket (this one is 6-ply) and spin seems a big step up.The only flaw I noticed was the tape covering the plys seemed very loosely adhered out of the box. I pressed it down harder and it seems to be staying.Who this is for: the amateur player who plays regularly and looking to upgrade your racket without completely breaking the bank.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L91LHOAU6T9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFY9F1C#wasThisHelpful","R3L91LHOAU6T9Y","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very decent set of wired headphones and a good value if you are paying around $30 or less for them. The sound quality is above average with quality bass levels. The box boasts a 40mm driver unit. I did not notice the mid-ranges as very muddy as another reviewer noted, but I did feel the higher ranges tended to be a bit washed out at times. Though these are advertised as ""fully enclosed,"" it does not mean the foam pads go fully around the ear. They are designed to sit on-ear. However, I was able to wear them for over an hour with little to no discomfort. The foam pads are comfortable and the wide headband made it so they didn't add excessive pressure. I appreciate the compactness of the foldable design, which allows for more easier travel. Also, I like the aesthetics of them, with the raised Pioneer logo over circular grooves, with a chrome circular bezel around the outside.Specs:Impedance: 32 OhmsSesitivity: 105dBFrequency response: 10Hz to 30,000HzMax input power: 1,000mW","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NEFZR1HOGFNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMLX0AW#wasThisHelpful","R2NEFZR1HOGFNE","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dogs don't have any allergies that I'm aware of, but thought I'd try this high-end food because I love them and want them to be healthy! At first, my Tibetan Spaniel was very enthused, taking each kibble away to her secret lair to savor like a special treat - the Pekingese was unimpressed with it as a treat, but that is her way. Still, I thought we were onto something. I mixed it for dinner with a bit of their old kibble (Pedigree) and some canned food, which is their usual dinner.After a few days, the Tibetan seems much less impressed. She often leaves some kibble in her bowl after dinner, and it seems to be a higher percentage of this expensive food while more of the Pedigree has been eaten. If anything, she feels pretty neutral about both and neither one tastes better. The Peke enthusiastically finishes anything that is mixed with canned food, so she's no help at all! She is finicky about treats, but always finishes her dinner.If your dog has grain issues or other allergies, they will probably do quite well with this. The flavor seems to be good (I haven't tasted it, just going by my dogs here) and there is no trouble with digestion. If your dogs have no issues and you're okay with commercial food, you can probably save money and just get a ""healthy-ish"" food at the grocery store. If mine were over the moon for how great this tasted, I'd continue to get it for them despite the higher price, but the fact that they don't seem to care and have no health problems - I'll probably go back to Pedigree. Good quality stuff if your dog needs it though!One issue that is a sure star deduction however, is the non-resealable bag. It's a HUGE bag, and stuffed quite full, which seems a good value at first but it's nearly impossible to recluse even with multiple sturdy chip clips. It has to start tasting stale pretty fast, I would think? Especially for small dogs like mine that only eat about a half-cup each day. Even at the current high-end price, I'd still pay a dollar or two more for a zip-closure bag that keeps it from getting stale.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CG321C6DRSTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECOLDP6#wasThisHelpful","R3CG321C6DRSTZ","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It seems everyone is looking for a way to get their whiskey and bourbon cold without diluting it with regular ice. This freezable whiskey glass has a partially liquid-filled pocket. You place the glass in the freezer upside-down until the liquid freezes. Pour your whiskey into the glass and the frozen glass cools it without diluting it. There is also a rubberized base for gripping and to prevent excessive sweating. I would probably pass on this method of cooling your favorite rye or even getting it as a gift for someone.Problem 1 - the method of packaging the set of two glasses led to one of them being cracked upon delivery. Because the glass was cracked, the liquid inside leaked out of the glass. I think there is a weak point near the top of the glass. Also, the method of packaging seemed pretty flimsy. For this reason, I would avoid buying this as a gift for someone. Still, one glass was intact, so I was able to try it out.Problem 2 - it really didn't cool the whiskey all that much very quickly. It did cool my lips rather well, and room temperature whiskey passing over cooled lips does sort of give it a cooler sensation. I just didn't think it chilled it enough. I probably didn't leave it in the glass long enough. However, when you do, that leads to problem 3.Problem 3 - After a while, the ""ice"" embedded in the glass starts to melt partially and you see the ice/liquid mix move around within the glass. You also see the ""frost"" on the outside melt in weird patterns. It is not a very ""pretty"" sight. It is just ugly, especially with the black silicone base. One potential solution of this is to use the glass simply to chill the drink, then pour it into another glass. For that reason I gave this two stars, instead of one.If you don't like the whiskey stones or the huge ice cube, this might be a way to cool your drink, as long as you don't care about looks. And hopefully, you'll get a package with both glasses intact.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R170G8K6O1RSN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M72R7QY#wasThisHelpful","R170G8K6O1RSN3","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The description is accurate - feels like a solid, soft fabric out of the package, yet dissolves completely in water! You *could* use an additional thin layer of the clear, lightweight water-soluble stabilizer on top, but I haven't encountered a need for it yet. This was my first time making free-standing lace on the embroidery machine, and it came out absolutely perfect! It's AMAZING to watch it dissolve in water, crafts meet science in the coolest way!! I used a small bowl of warm water, but temperature didn't seem to matter. It feels a bit sticky if you reach in and mess with the project while the stabilizer is melting; make sure it dissolves completely before drying it out. I let my lace lay flat on a paper towel overnight, and it became stiff-but-flexible, perfect for sewing on embellishments!This package is quite small, I got it just because I wanted to make sure it worked before committing to a huge roll. I liked it so much that I ordered a big roll immediately after trying it out, but found I was also able to use some of the decent-sized scraps. If you don't have a piece big enough to hoop, you can overlap them to make them hoop-able for stitching out a project. I tried this and it stitched just perfectly; the stabilizer melted away just like it did in a single layer and the final product looked exactly the same as the single-layer projects.

"Wish these came with instructions, but they're very easy to figure out. Just poke some tiny holes in your fabric, attach the backing, and you have a beautiful professional looking snap closure! SO much easier than traditional sew-on snaps, and gives a polished look to your final project. I use them on handbags and they're awesome! Adding some interfacing (even just a small square of it) between the prongs and the washer really helps to protect your fabric upon repeated use of the snaps, opening & closing your handbag (or whatever you've made) over and over. The magnets are good quality too - stick to each other but not TOO tight, just the right amount.This seems like a very good price to me, considering how many you get. I haven't really shopped around though, it just seems very reasonable for what I wanted. Honestly, any time I go into a fabric store I buy WAY more than I came in for, so ordering online saves me a lot of money even if it would have been a little cheaper for the same product in a brick-and-mortar!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIFXYEIMIZID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FR39RMM#wasThisHelpful","R1WIFXYEIMIZID","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been doing basic sewing for probably 30 years, but have never tried a serger before. I always wanted one, but when it arrived...it was VERY intimidating! All those threads, those dials, the extra needles, how do you even do this?? The videos that came with it made me even more afraid of the thing - they're very poorly produced, blurry, and go way too fast over the more complicated parts, such as threading the loopers. Thusly, after excitedly unwrapping my new serger, I let it gather dust in my sewing room for nearly a year before even turning it on!Finally I took an all-day serger class at the American Sewing Expo, which finally made me less afraid of the thing, so I finally gave it a shot. It came pre-loaded with some white thread and pre-set to a basic 4-thread overlock, so really all I had to do all along was step on the pedal and go! Unfortunately, the machine I used in class was an incredibly expensive, self-threading BabyLock, so I'm still struggling with looper threading and some of the other settings for decorative edges. This machine CAN do lots of interesting edges, don't get me wrong - it just takes some dedication to learning how. It's a powerful little machine, but it doesn't hold your hand. You have to practice; serging is not the same as sewing!The books that come with it are much more helpful than the videos. The booklet that outlines the settings required to do various decorative stitches is extremely useful, but it's not a bible - be prepared to tweak and experiment with different kinds of fabrics before tackling your real project. Having taken a class beforehand was very helpful too; if you have access to a class and have never used a serger before, I highly recommend signing up, if only to get accustomed to the terminology and have some tips from serger veterans. The main operation book does tell you how to thread the loopers, but this takes practice! Also, after I spent an entire day struggling with a lower looper that looked right but didn't serge correctly, a friend tipped me off that you often have to re-thread the entire machine, left to right, even if you're only trying to change just one of the threads. I don't know why this worked, but it did!This is a GREAT price for a powerful little serger, and is a good starter model for newbies, but be prepared to do some research on the side & plan on practicing a LOT before it will give you the professional results you want. Don't be like me, don't be afraid to touch it for nearly a year! It's not scary at all, and it can do a ton of cool things. You can figure it out if you put a little time into it, and for very little money you will add a whole new dimension to your sewing!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XIEHRCIOWS1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJW5OTC#wasThisHelpful","R1XIEHRCIOWS1P","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had started playing the first couple Assassin's Creed titles and was seeing improvement in each one up through Brotherhood. I really got bogged down in Revelations and sort of got bored with the series. So, unfortunately, it took me a long time to get back into it and play AC IV: Black Flag. I was missing out. This game is a marked improvement over AC III in the controls and the environment. A huge open world environment gives you lots of things to do. Adding the seafaring component of gameplay really freshened up the type of gameplay I was getting bored with (climb up big buildings, accidentally trigger a chase scene with guard, kill said guards, walk away). Don't get me wrong. There is still an element of repetition in the missions, which AC games really have a hard time shaking since the original. However, for the most part, the fresh perspective and setting made it much more bearable.

"This is NOT my first pair of FitFlops; a few months ago my basic black ones just looked too beat-up to wear outside the house & my sequined black ones broke a strap. Clearly I love the FitFlops and can't go without a black pair! They're all quite comfortable & hug my high arches, helping tremendously with plantar fasciitis pain, but this pair is even BETTER! Not only is the flower pretty (but subtle), there is a bit of padding beneath the T-straps now, so the top of my foot feels just as comfy as the bottom! Also the padding decreases any slight looseness, so my toes don't try to grip the shoe at all, which caused a few foot cramps in the sequined pair.I also have FitFlop slippers and ankle boots - they really work for my ouchy feet!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SPEGDEJRIN3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FLMT9U#wasThisHelpful","R1SPEGDEJRIN3M","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We loved every minute of ten seasons of this goofy, over-the-top, sugary-sweet show, and the finale of Season 10 was clearly meant to be the series finale. Most of the series regulars had departed, and a group of new ""orphans"" were tacked on in S11 just because otherwise there would be no plot whatsoever. Notably, all the early characters (Jessica Biel, Barry Watson, etc) who had moved on at various times throughout the series all returned for a heartwarming cameo in the Season 10 finale, yet were barely mentioned in S11.Granted, one of the reasons we loved the show was that so many of the plot lines were pretty ridiculous, but S11 went so far past the mark that it barely even made sense. We pushed through and watched the whole thing (because hey, you don't slog through an entire series just to give up halfway through the last season) but if we ever sit down and watch again, we're just going to pretend that they didn't really make Season 11 and skip it.We read a few articles online that Season 10 really was intended to be the last season, and it's very clear that the final episode that year was meant to be the series finale. I don't know how they talked Stephen Collins, Catherine Hicks, and Beverley Mitchell into coming back for this pointless farce, but most importantly - I don't know WHY.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F1Z2C063ECSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWMAX9Y#wasThisHelpful","R3F1Z2C063ECSM","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Oral B Crest Complete Whitening Kit is a bundle of decent products designed to get your teeth whiter in as little as two weeks.  Mostly what you are buying is the toothbrush, some extra heads, and whitening strips.  It also has some extras such as a small bottle of mouthwash, some whitening toothpaste, with a small tote bag and a luggage tag? I have a feeling this pack was designed for swag at a dental conference or something.Toothbrush:I think the toothbrush is great.  I love that it comes with a travel case where you can also store the extra heads.  I always brush too hard and it has a light I can see in the mirror to notify me when I'm brushing too hard. The only bad part is that it seems to take awhile to fully charge.  However,  I think you can probably still get several days out of it with regular use before having to recharge, even when only mostly charged.Whitening strips:Pro: Super sticky when applied to dry teeth.Con: Tough to adhere to moistened teeth.In short, they will stick well to the upper teeth. With the saliva near your bottom teeth,  you probably want to use cotton in your lower gums while trying to adhere the strips to your lower teeth. My teeth did seem a little whiter after using, but it was hard to discern a noticeable difference.Mouthwash:The peroxide whitening mouthwash left me with a weird aftertaste,  sort of like dried mushrooms.  It was really weird.  It also leaves a slight foaming residue.  Definitely not something I was used to, but not terrible, and the aftertaste went away quickly.Toothpaste:This kit included some whitening toothpaste.  I can't really say it made my teeth any whiter by itself,  though.Whitening power:I think if you were really committed to getting whiter teeth to go to all the hassle of using this entire kit and the strips for two weeks,  you could probably get better results from a professional dentist.Overall:You are basically buying the toothbrush here with a bunch of extras.  The toothbrush is fantastic though, leaving my teeth feeling super clean.  However,  it was about the same as the other Oral B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 (which I also own).  I like the travel case and the extra brush heads and head holder.  However,  I'm not sure the kit is worth the extra expense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQB8LK0MA9IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZH3FGM#wasThisHelpful","RAQB8LK0MA9IB","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The newest version of Rocksmith sees some improvements and advances in game play over the prior version,  making it a joy to play and stick with. I got the original Rocksmith and was pleasantly surprised at how much it was able to teach me.  However,  the menu and progressing through the lessons was a little unintuitive.  It was tough to get from just playing a song,  back to the lessons.  The newest version has a much more intuitive menu,  where it is easy to just pick up and play some songs, or, if you are going down the lesson track, to sit down and learn a song, or specific part of a song to master a technique.The ""guitarcade"" is a collection of mini-games to help practice your technique. It is themed around an 80s style arcade,  which doesn't really fit with the rest of the style of the game, but that's okay, it's still fun.  You will have no problem with lag as long as you use the audio out through the RCA cables and not the HDMI or Optical out.One aspect of this version that is both good and bad is the inclusion of the lead or rhythm guitar learning track (or you can choose bass track).  With the last version, you would learn aspects of the lead guitar along with aspects of the rhythm guitar.  I like that it provides an option to focus on what you do best (or want to focus your learning on). On the other hand, I liked having all parts of the song intermixed in one track. I'm mainly on the rhythm guitar learning track, but I really miss being able to play certain lead riffs.There is enough variety of styles and genres in this to keep you interested,  even if every song is not your cup of tea. You should find enough songs to learn to make it worth it, no matter your musical taste.  A great game and a big improvement over the last version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HFGYQWF2599I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6PTMSW#wasThisHelpful","R1HFGYQWF2599I","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My arches are very high, and in the summertime my Fitflops conform to my feet like a firm version of memory foam, helping alleviate pain from plantar fasciitis. I've been wearing cheap slippers for too long & my feet hurt, so I shelled out to get some REALLY GOOD slippers like these.They're a little tight in the toes, and take a while to break in, but I really do love them. I suppose if I spent more time standing up, they'd break in faster! At first they felt very hard and cold but after a few hours I was reluctant to take them off. After wearing them for about 6 weeks now, they're starting to conform to my feet and feel good. Even though the backs are open, they are quite warm and cozy.The bottoms are extremely thick and waterproof, so I have no problem going outside in a little bit of snow or rain to get my dog if I need to. That was a must, for me!They're taking longer to break in than I expected, but I do love them so. I feel like the long break-in period means they will not fall apart easily and I can wear them for many winters to come. They are VERY good quality, solid, warm, and well-constructed. Much pinker than in the photo! Pretty close to Barbie Pink, which is a bonus for me but may not be for you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MUERH6TG3LK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQZH5O2#wasThisHelpful","R1MUERH6TG3LK2","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before you open the box, gather up 4 AA batteries and one of those tiny little Phillips-head screwdrivers. One of the screws holding my battery cover in place was in so tight that it took 4 different screwdrivers and the screw head is almost completely stripped now - I won't be screwing this back in too tightly, on the off chance that the batteries may die someday.The box is much, much bigger than the pieces require, so they rattled around a lot during shipping and the ""stage"" portion is pretty scratched up. I'm sure my 5-year-old nephew won't care very much but it just seems like they're trying to make you think you're buying a much larger, more impressive toy than you actually get. Inside, the smaller pieces are divided into plastic bags in a way that makes no sense whatsoever - basically you need to open every single bag before you can assemble even one portion of the final toy. The packaging engineers at Playmobil need to buy a few pieces of Ikea furniture and take a lot of notes about how to package in a logical, space-saving way that follows the chronology of assembly. Ultimately it only took me about 55 minutes to assemble the whole thing (about 15 of which involved wrestling the battery cover), but fortunately I didn't have my nephew over my shoulder impatiently demanding to play with it sooner. So if you're getting this as a gift for someone, open 'er up and assemble it FIRST.The light feature is pretty cool, and the fact that you can broadcast your own music through the speakers is fun. The speakers are very cheap and sound tinny, but it is a pretty inexpensive toy so what can you expect. Unfortunately, kids today are accustomed to very sophisticated technology so I don't know if my nephew will find that to be a cool thing for long or not. Fun idea though. It does come with two pre-loaded songs that are pretty awful, and the volume control has two settings: ""not that loud"" and ""slightly louder."" Plugging in an mp3 player, iPod, etc, is very easy through a headphone jack connection (which means you can use anything that has a headphone jack) but integrating a small holder for your iPod or phone would be a handy improvement.Once assembled, the stage does look pretty cool and the instruments (especially the guitars) are great looking! The band members, not so much. As others have mentioned, they're all dudes, which is pretty outdated, and their outfits - OMG. Does the designer think that today's kid's love Def Leppard and Bon Jovi or what?? VERY dated, goofy outfits. Maybe current ""rock bands"" do dress like 1980's AC/DC tribute clubs, but just in case, maybe Playmobil could offer some other ""bands"" to play on your stage, even include a little keyboard or DJ booth in the future. This has some potential for expansion, if your kid doesn't break it first - everything feels a little flimsy but I suppose it all depends on how hard they want to rock out.Loved the idea of this, but am not too impressed with the execution.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KQ3J29O8KUEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFOD6OQ#wasThisHelpful","R3KQ3J29O8KUEB","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We originally got this for our younger dog, Peach, who is a puppy mill rescue and has some separation anxiety when I leave the house. It seemed to make her pretty sleepy, which will be excellent for thunderstorms and fireworks but not for everyday use. We don't use it with her very often because for general purposes, I'd rather not have her sleep the day away. She's a sweet, playful dog so I don't want to knock her out unless there is something she is REALLY upset about (i.e. fireworks).I decided to try it on our senior dog, Dennis (very senior - 16 yrs old), because some nights he just gets so fussy and can't seem to get comfortable enough to settle down and go to sleep. He's on a variety of other medications and supplements due to his age and various ailments (arthritis, deteriorating vision & hearing, etc) so I checked with the vet & the natural ingredients in this Calming Aid would not interact with anything else he takes. It REALLY helps him get to sleep if he is having a rough night!Our dogs are small, under 25 lbs, so they're supposed to get only 1/2 treat per dose. Unfortunately, the fact that these must be stored in the fridge makes them really hard to break in half without mushing them into oblivion. Honestly, Dennis does better with a whole treat anyway, with no adverse effects that I can see. Half a treat does nothing, while a whole treat lets him sleep. He likes the taste, too. Many of his treats & supplements must be given to him over & over because he spits them out the first 3 or 4 times, but he chews these right up happily.In general our dogs have pretty mellow personalities, so if your dog is really crazy and energetic, it might just make them calm. For mine, it makes them sleepy. But for some situations that would otherwise be upsetting for them, it's not really a bad thing to have them take a little nap instead of having a freak-out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPAM3MIKWM1V9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFQ6TQM#wasThisHelpful","RPAM3MIKWM1V9","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My pekingese, Dennis, is a pretty ripe 16 years old. He has arthritis in his back & hips, is nearly blind and seems to have some trouble hearing, too (tries to respond to noises but generally looks the wrong direction). For the last year, he seemed to be feeling worse & worse and would sit on his bed wailing for help several times per day. The vet had him on several pain medications but we couldn't increase it anymore, so they suggested he may be suffering from some mild dementia due to his advanced age, and recommended a veterinary supplement (not this one - stick with me, it will all make sense soon). After a few days, little old Dennis decreased his wailing and began getting up to have a snack or ask to be let outside for a potty break.The change after beginning the vet supplement was mild but good, so I asked them if it would be okay to add this product (Canine Plus Senior) to his daily treats; they said it couldn't hurt. He seemed to get even better, even faster! It's almost like, he was crying before because his belly hurt but he didn't know why - now he seems to know when he's hungry or has to go potty, and gets up to do something about it. He seems to have a little bit of an easier time getting around, too, so I think this is helping with his arthritis (just a little bit, but still). The two supplements seem to be working well together, but the Canine Plus Senior seems to be the more helpful one for Dennis. If we skip a day, he seems to get very fussy and confused again within the next 12-24 hours.It's not a miracle cure, don't get me wrong. He's still a half-deaf, mostly blind, arthritic 16-yr-old dog. This really seems to have made him more comfortable and energetic though, and a lot less confused, so I am very happy we discovered it! He likes the taste too, so we don't even have to wrap it in lunchmeat (unlike the ones from the vet). I'll definitely be buying more when we run low!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12LKY271VWHCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018MBR1U#wasThisHelpful","R12LKY271VWHCT","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First the good: it definitely does charge your iPhone 5, and does it very quickly. So, as a backup charger, that's very good. I often work at art fairs where I may be outdoors for 12 hours or more with no access to electricity, so being able to charge my phone at some point is very important. Make sure the Power Case is charged all the way up before you need it, because you get one charge out of it and then it needs to be plugged back in. To me it seems to take a very long time to recharge the battery once it has been used to charge the phone.Other reviewers have mentioned the bulky size/weight, and I will too - for a backup battery, it's not unreasonably heavy, but as a general case, it adds some fairly significant bulk to the phone. Maybe if I had gotten it at the same time as my phone, I would be used to it, but I've had my phone for a year and am accustomed to its size and shape so adding this large case feels a lot different. Also, I currently protect my phone in a thin, light, plastic case with a pretty design on the back - sue me, I'm female, I'm a designer, I like my phone to have a little personality. So, for charging, I have to carefully snap the phone out of my normal case before snapping it into this charger case. I have no desire to switch to this Power Case full-time in favor of the cute one. I LIKE my cute one, and this is the electronic equivalent of a Hefty bag.The thing is, it charges the phone so quickly that there's really no need for it to be a case rather than an external charger. I would actually like it a lot as an external charger! As it is, I have to take apart my other case, snap this one on, charge for less than an hour, then take it apart again and put my old case back on. If it were lighter, more streamlined, and let's face it - better looking, it might have more use as a case too, but as simply a backup charger, it involves a lot of extra unnecessary steps.I used it twice and went back to my old external charger for art shows. I still take it along if I'm concerned about using my phone a lot for long hours without access to electricity, but I find it pretty inconvenient and prefer to use something else when possible.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ5QMM9B5Q52I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENZRQ96#wasThisHelpful","RZ5QMM9B5Q52I","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT/UPDATE: These stupid crap spools have now ruined countless projects. If you thread them beneath the spool as my machine dictates, they become wound around the spool pin because the spool cap doesn't fit neatly inside the small end of the spool. If you thread them above the spool, they fit into the larger spool cap perfectly but continually get caught on the bobbin winder. Either way, first they get stuck, then they yank the bobbin thread through the project, then the needle snaps in half. I wish I could give this thread a rating of negative infinity! DO NOT BUY if your machine feeds thread from below the spool, it will not work!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -I don't really follow color charts; I look at what the design is going to require and what color fabric base I'll be using, and sometimes vary widely from the recommended colors for a particular pattern. If you prefer to follow color charts exactly, you may have a problem with these for two reasons. First, based on the other reviews, these color numbers may not match up with your machine's brand or your pattern's advise. Second, the color number is printed on a sticker at the end of the spool, which must be removed before use. Maybe you could peel it off carefully and stick it carefully somewhere inside the bottom of the spool, I'm not sure.I have a Brother DZ820E, which is basically the same as a PE770. It came with a starter pack of Radiant Thread, which worked great, so I sought this brand specifically. The thread is nice quality, rich colors, and usually moves smoothly through the needle and inner mechanisms of the machine. With 100 spools, you obviously get a pretty good variety, but I was disappointed to not see more shades of gray and no ""peach"" that looks quite right for a caucasian skin tone (I like to embroider a lot of pinup-girl motifs). Also, be aware that these are are 550 yards, so they're about 1/2 the size of what I was used to - the spools themselves are shorter in height, not thinner wound. There are plenty of infrequently-used colors that should last a good long time on a small spool, but for things like black, you'll run out extremely fast. Wish they could have skipped a shade or two of bright orange and thrown in an extra black.Though the thread is nice, the spools are hateful little things! They are the main reason for the 3-star review. They are cheap plastic, with rough edges where the thread occasionally gets caught. The worst part though, for my machine, is that they don't fit tight to the spool cap for mounting on my horizontal spool pin - other brands I've purchased (Marathon, ThreadArt) fit neatly into the spool cap like a puzzle piece and rarely get tangled around the pin. These spools leave a small angled gap between the cap and the spool, and the thread gets wound up around the pin CONSTANTLY, stopping the supply of thread to the machine & needing to be rethreaded every single time. It is extremely annoying and hard to prevent. In fact, just as I was typing this, some thread got tangled up so tightly around the spool pin that it actually snapped off the end of the needle way down at the other end of the sewing machine.I've had almost no fraying with this brand of thread, but the spools are just too much of a pain for me to ever buy these again. I've got the ThreadArt sets back on my wish list and will just have to try and supervise these spools as much as I can to try and keep them unwinding smoothly off the spools.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V6HKKI1XU9Y6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZSF01S#wasThisHelpful","R3V6HKKI1XU9Y6","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this review is of the EnviroBulb PAR30. This is the version without the diffuser cover. The LED light is around the outer right and reflective material angled in the center spreads the light out. Without the diffuser, this is a very intense light, which I like, but may not be for everyone.It fits perfectly in our standard size recessed can lights. I‚Äôve had other bulbs that fill the can and practically touch the sides. This works great with our dimmer switch, too. It doesn‚Äôt have any hum and smoothly dims from brightest intensity to lowest. I‚Äôve tried other CFLs that claim to be dimmable, but they just bounce around at different intensities. Not the case with this EnviroBulb. While I do not have the capacity to test and verify their energy savings capacity and lifespan, I can say that the emitted light is bright and intense, but pleasant. If the energy savings are anywhere near what they claim, it is well worth the increased cost of these LEDs, especially considering their superiority over CFLs (whose light quality I cannot stand).I would like to see all of my can lights replaced with an LED bulb like this, but due to their cost, I will probably have to replace them one at a time. I can‚Äôt afford to just buy an 8 pack of these the way you could with incandescents. Here‚Äôs one thing to keep in mind with LEDs - there is a wide variety in bulb shape and design. I have a couple in my home from different brands and they look completely different. If you are buying them one at a time and are using them in open recessed light cans, you may want to make sure you are getting the same kind, if you care about the matching aesthetics of the exposed bulb.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U5NJPS5MCBQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3T6OHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2U5NJPS5MCBQM","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This divot repair tool would make an excellent gift for any golf aficionado. There are many similar tools out there (for the same price or more), but don't have all the extra tools this does. Most others have a magnetic ball mark and the ball mark repair tool, but they don't have the bottle cap opener, cigar holder, can opener and club rest. I especially like the club rest. When I walk towards the green with my wedge and putter, I hate having to set the putter down on the wet grass. So I just pull this out, stick it in the ground and set the putter into the top grooves. This is such a simple thing, I can't believe all of these tools don't have it. For this reason alone, this warrants 5 stars.I can't see using the bottle cap opener much since I don't usually have bottled beverages on the course, but if you are a cigar smoker, the same thing functions as that. The tool also has a heft most others lack - made of a thick, polished metal, it definitely has a solid feel in your hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33SR7CT4GYA77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007C8FC9W#wasThisHelpful","R33SR7CT4GYA77","AQMUXDDCLJSSV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQMUXDDCLJSSV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So first thing is that these gloves seem to run small in size. I normally wear a women's medium in gloves. These fit except they are too long in the fingers. I think a size smaller would have been too tight.The gloves are well made and are pretty warm though I don't think they would be warm enough if I wore them while shoveling snow. Which is too bad because they have extra padding in the palm and thumb that makes it comfortable to use a shovel. I wore them while raking leaves and I appreciated the comfort of these gloves.

I used another product before that had that in it and I also liked that scent very much.This does not come in a jar but in a tube. It takes up less room in my already over-crowded shower shelves.

"Disclaimer: I received this product free in exchange for an honest review.This is the second Luseta product line I have been lucky enough to receive for review. This first was the Argan Oil line, which I loved. The Keratin shampoo and conditioner are equally wonderful. The shampoo is moisturizing without stripping color, which is important as I color my hair red and that can fade easily. The conditioner is also moisturizing and my hair was very soft after use. It was still soft after using the blow dryer and hair straightener, I did have to use any oil or serum with it. When I just air-dry my hair, it didn't get frizzy. And the smell is very nice, not like products with added fragrance that can be too strong. And no sulfates!Both shampoo and conditioner come in large bottles, so the price is pretty reasonable for the amount you will be getting.I noted in my review of the Argan Oil products that the shampoo and conditioner look the same, a creamy white, so just double check the label as it is the same with the Keratin line. They are packaged well so that there is no leakage during delivery. The pumps are handy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R128KIELIL8RQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JEZSAA#wasThisHelpful","R128KIELIL8RQX","A1QXWM5P0CT45","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXWM5P0CT45?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I received this product free in exchange for an honest review.I love having the opportunity to review shampoo and conditioning products because even if I don't like them I can use the shampoo as bubble bath and the conditioner for shaving.  But after using them, I know the Luseta Argan Oil products will not be in my bath! I have been disappointed with some of the oil hair products that are coming out. The last one made my hair drier. It was also nice to be able to use the shampoo and conditioner together and get a better sense of the quality of the products.I used these after coloring my hair, when it can be dry. Normally, I have to use the conditioner that comes in the box. The Luseta shampoo was creamy and moisturizing, it did not strip any color, it is sulfate-free. The conditioner was fabulous, my hair feels softer than before I colored it. It's so soft, I keep running my hands through it. It didn't get frizzy when I just let it dry naturally. I am very happy with these products. They both also smell nice. I look forward to trying out their hair oil treatment.They come in very large bottles, so I think the price is very reasonable for the pair. This will last a long time. I also like that it comes in a pump form, it is more convenient. Just note that both the shampoo and conditioner are a creamy white, it would be easy to mix them up without looking at the label. My only suggestion to the company would be packaging that differentiates the different products in their line. I have received their Karatin shampoo and conditioner to review and the bottles look the same as this line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0C1PYYYTFQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GRXWCO#wasThisHelpful","RL0C1PYYYTFQI","A1QXWM5P0CT45","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXWM5P0CT45?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I did not love every story in here and I am not a James Patterson fan, I really enjoyed this as a whole. I am assuming that Patterson as editor means he picked what stories went in the collection. I think he did a great job and short stories might be my new favorite way of reading mysteries.  Many of the stories are not mysteries in the traditional way and I would consider them more as dark and literary stories. But they were still good. If I didn't like a story, no biggie, it wasn't very long. The only story I truly disliked was ""Many Dogs Have Died Here"". It was ridiculous and made no sense. But I discovered that Jeffery Deaver, whom I have heard of but never read, is a great writer, ""The Adventure of the Laughing Fisherman"" was my favorite and one that is a more traditional mystery and one that I had hoped to find he'd turned into a novel. I now have a short story collection of Deaver's on my Kindle to read. Joyce Carol Oates is in here with ""The Home at Craigmillnar"". I have read that previously in one of her collections and enjoyed it. Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly wrote a story that brought together two characters they are known for; Patrick Kenzie and Harry Bosch. Most of the authors I had not even heard of before which I liked so then I didn't know what to expect. This was a great collection, perfect for people who enjoy mysteries even if they don't read them often. I think I may purchase the 2014 mystery collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C679ZXQSKC3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544526759#wasThisHelpful","R1C679ZXQSKC3T","A1QXWM5P0CT45","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXWM5P0CT45?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is also not too loud so I don't disturb my co-workers. This worked great for regular pencils and mostly pretty well for my colored pencils, a couple were a bit choppy.

"Oh, how I love memory foam! I have a few toppers and practically have another mattress worth of them. I thought about adding this one on top but then I wouldn't even be able to climb in bed without stairs. I decided to remove the top one as it really was only a couple inches of memory foam and one inch of regular foam. When I put this new one on instead, I really noticed a difference. It is all memory foam and since it wasn't shipped as compressed as most of them are, it quickly became the full three inches. There are air holes for ventilation. I have never had an issue of memory foam being too warm, so I didn't notice anything different. I put a quilted topper on this and I sleep between layers of comforters and quilts, so I wouldn't notice anything anyway as far as temperature. The company says this is supposed to be one inch shorter in each side to fit with your sheets. I did not notice it shorter than my queen size mattress but it is shorter than other toppers. This is nice as it makes the bed look neater.So for the final test; sleeping. This topper is firmer than other toppers that I have and it actually was much more comfortable and hopefully, more durable. I slept fantastic!!! I find memory foam so much more comfortable than regular mattresses. My regular mattress was getting a bit soft, these toppers are a great way to put off having to make an expensive purchase. I would definitely recommend this topper, it is the best of all that I have tried.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NONB6P973V20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YHD53VM#wasThisHelpful","R2NONB6P973V20","A1QXWM5P0CT45","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXWM5P0CT45?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This oil shampoo doesn't have much oil in it but it is a very creamy shampoo that gives lots of lather when you use it. I rarely find this with shampoos that are sulfate and silicone free which this is. I have missed that with what I currently use. That being said, I'm not sure that the outcome is much different from similar products. I thought the oil infusion would make my hair softer or that I'd be able to use this without conditioner on the days I don't need to blow dry but that did not happen.

"I have used this cream for a few mornings and nights so far. It is light and doesn't cause any breakouts. The anit-fatigue part is that this is supposed to help with under-eye puffiness which I don't have. I have the dark circles. The only thing that helps with that is plenty of sleep and concealer. I have noticed, however, that I look less Zombie-ish in the mornings. And my concealer goes on easier.

"I am a big fan of Matthew Dicks. His last novel, Memoirs of an Imaginary Friend was a very touching and quirky novel that I just loved. Unfortunately, The Perfect Comeback of Caroline Jacobs pales in comparison. It is my least favorite of his novels. If you have never read his work, I suggest starting with Something Missing. If you read his one, you won't be inspired to read his other works.There are two reasons I didn't like this book. First, Caroline Jacobs. She is a pushover, she isn't a very interesting character. She irritated me. The second things I didn't like was that much of the plot seemed so contrived. Caroline gets mad and swears at a mom bully at a PTA meeting, then the next day  she picks up her daughter, Polly, at school because Polly punched another student in defense of her mother. Caroline doesn't take her home but instead takes her on a roadtrip back to where she grew up, so she can confront her former best friend, Emily, who ditched her once they started high school. I know bullying is a sensitive issue and a huge problem but I wouldn't say that Caroline had been bullied. Emily no longer wanted to be friends with Caroline because she wanted to be popular. She cut Caroline out of her life in a not very nice way but did not continue to harass her once she was out. Emily wasn't nice, certainly, but I found it hard to believe that this resulted in Caroline not being able to stand up for herself as an adult. Telling Emily off isn't going to accomplish anything and it felt forced that this was a decision Caroline suddenly made. But this was contrived to get Caroline back home where other events could be brought to light. There were parts of this book that were touching and meaningful. But the plot to get to those parts was very mediocre. There were some interesting characters, I really liked Polly.I would not recommend this book to anyone but I would recommend this author and his other books. I will definitely read his next book. This one just felt flat to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R197J1XSKAL1WD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250006309#wasThisHelpful","R197J1XSKAL1WD","A1QXWM5P0CT45","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXWM5P0CT45?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My grandmother's cats get more finicky about their food as they get older so I decided to entice them with these Divine Duos. The Tilapia pate with Ahi tuna was tried but not really loved. They mostly tried to get to the tuna. I think they would have eaten more if it didn't have the pate. However, they did love the chicken pate over diced salmon. It was the winner of the three, with tuna over diced salmon coming in second. They now only eat dry food if it is mixed with wet which is good as I think it would take a lot of canned food to fill them up.These easy peel back lids are nice, especially for an elderly grandma.The downfall is that Wellness isn't made in the US, so I don't know where they get their ingredients.The price wouldn't be so bad if that meant a better safety guarantee..","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ASDUJ3YOL4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4GLVW4#wasThisHelpful","R6ASDUJ3YOL4H","A1QXWM5P0CT45","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXWM5P0CT45?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a big fan of oil cleansing. I started doing this a couple of years ago and my skin is so much better, I rarely break out. Unfortunately, this does not do what oil cleansing is supposed to do. Even though the first ingredient is mineral oil (not an oil that I use) it left my skin feeling dry. I have used Neutrogena products before and they are generally pretty good. But this is a fail. It is cheaper and more effective to use coconut or almond oil which are my preferences. Lots of people use olive oil and swear by it as well. Oil cleaning really does work for oily or acne prone skin. I wish I had learned this years ago.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LWIL9VF4NFQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01034IN9M#wasThisHelpful","R2LWIL9VF4NFQI","A1QXWM5P0CT45","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXWM5P0CT45?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never read anything by China Mi√©ville before but I first heard of him when The City & The City was released, it was all anyone on bookish social media could talk about. I'm not a huge fan of speculative fiction  so I never tried to read it. But when I had the opportunity to review this book, I grabbed it because short stories are the best way for me to try new genres.Mi√©ville didn't disappoint me. Such a variety of stories, many that left me hanging and wanting them to become novels and others that just seemed weird or disturbing and I would end up skipping to the next story. But because they were very different from each other, I am not able to get a solid feel for his writing. I don't think I could read one of his novels and know what to expect.I'm not sure I would recommend this to a reader unfamiliar with his work or not a fan of fantasy. But if you already like him, you will probably like these short stories.So like I said, not really my genre but I'm glad to have tried a new reading experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z24IND622RYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110188472X#wasThisHelpful","R1Z24IND622RYA","A1QXWM5P0CT45","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXWM5P0CT45?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a really hard time getting into this book. The cover is very off-putting. It wasn't until I read good some reviews that I picked it back up and dove in. It was pretty average as far as writing and characters and the plot was just too familiar. Two girls are shipped off to live with their grandmother in Barbados because their mom can't take care of them. The older girl, Dionne is sixteen and ready to test boundaries. Phaedra is about ten and grows close to her grandmother who is an herbalist and midwife. Then the girls' no good father and trashy girlfriend show up to bring them back to Miami. Dionne wants to go but Phaedra knows her father is worthless.This is really a coming of age novel more than about a family. I felt that Phaedra was the central character and the most interesting. Other characters were not as well developed. Some reviews have commented that the novel makes them feel that they are in Barbados. I didn't feel anything like that, it was not very descriptive. I just didn't get any feelings about this story other than with the younger sister. Hyacinth, the grandmother, felt like a character I have met several times before. I honestly don't understand all the buzz about this book.I stand by my thoughts on the cover, I don't like it, although I read an article about why the author choose the get this work of art as her cover as it was done by a fellow artist from Barbados and it reminded her of Dionne. But I bet this will do better with ebook sales.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19W7SVZEBVJR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205957#wasThisHelpful","R19W7SVZEBVJR0","A1QXWM5P0CT45","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXWM5P0CT45?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a gorgeous deck that looks like Renaissance paintings with gilded edges and is on good quality heavy stock.The back of the cards are a nice subtle pattern of beige and browns. It comes in a beautiful stand-up box that you will want to keep using, unlike some I have gotten with other decks. It also comes with a book that interprets the meaning of the cards and also fits in the box which is great. These are harder for me to read that the Hanson-Roberts tarot deck that I use most frequently along with the Rider-Waite. But these are what I imagined I would use when I first got into tarot. I hope to be using them soon and not just keep as a collector's deck. These are even more beautiful than The Llewellyn deck I purchased recently.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R916R15MI1IWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1572814349#wasThisHelpful","R916R15MI1IWL","A1QXWM5P0CT45","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QXWM5P0CT45?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased four wireless chargers. I needed two each for the office and home. I did not know which one would work best and I am giving you my opinions of the four wireless Qi chargers in this review.Yootech triangle $14 http://amzn.com/B00NWMI07SYeesite Charging stand: $22 http://amzn.com/B00UE9O0WQYeesite Bamboo charger $21 http://amzn.com/B00ZED4HMKAnker charger $12.50 http://amzn.com/B00Y839YMUI have a Motorola Droid Turbo 2 phone released in mid-November 2015. The phone also has Turbo Charge which is the same as Quick Charge 2.0. NONE of the wireless chargers will charge as fast as the Turbo or Quick Charge but the wireless does seem to charge about as fast as the regular wired charger. The Turbo or Quick Charge requires a special hi-power supply that is several times stronger than the regular USB wall power supplies and charges about 3 times faster than wireless or regular wired chargers.I did not test the 4 different chargers against each other for charging speed but they all seemed to charge at about the same rate using 2 amp USB wall power supplies. Most wireless chargers recommend using a 2 amp output or stronger power supply. Most do NOT include the power supply, only a USB cable. It simply makes sense that with an inductive charger the stronger the power source the stronger the charging field and the faster the charging. Only the Bamboo included a charger, therefore be prepared to supply your own 2 amp USB charger with most of these.One of the major problems with wireless or Qi charging is getting the phone on the sweet spot. If the phone is not positioned just right on the charger, it won't charge. This is a big issue as you can spend time jockeying the phone around on the charger to get it to recognize the charger and begin charging.Two of the chargers did excellent in ease of placement.The Youtech triangle was the easiest by far. If I placed the phone on the Yootech triangle, I got it right 9 of 10 times. It was easy to place and I rarely got it wrong.The stand was second with a caveat. My phone had to be raised about 1/2 inch to work. I simply placed a 9 volt battery on the stand and then put the phone on top of the 9 volt battery and it charged every time. I will rig something more visually appealing that is 1/2"" high later. Wireless phone stands need a way of adjusting the height of the phone on the stand for varying sized phones or center charging spots on the phone. Although the 9v battery under the phone works, it is something the stand should have included to accommodate differing sized phones.Note: Your phone may not have a problem with the stand if the height is just right and thus you may need nothing to adjust the height. If that's the case, then the stand is the best bet because it is the easiest to place the phone and get right.With that consideration and a 9v battery, the stand wins hands down because it has positive placement and it keeps the phone in a position where you can see it on your desk with the Youtech triangle second.The bamboo was third and I could place it correctly about half the time and it looks exotic.The Anker was last and I could only place it correctly about a third of the time.The Anker does have the advantage of a more rubberized surface that keeps your phone from sliding off and it has the smallest footprint. Thus for mobile use the smaller size may weigh in heavily in it's favor.Note: This was the response from Anker: ""Sorry to hear that Anker wireless charger does not work in your desired way. As stated on listing, this is a single-coil wireless charger, which makes it a bit difficult for adjusting positioning for charging.""All charged well but you've got to get it charging first, thus my emphasis on the charging sweet spot.I will carry one in my laptop bag and that will be the Youtech triangle since the stand is too big and awkward to fit into a laptop bag. I will probably relegate the Anker and Bamboo chargers to some distant desk and order additional Youtech triangles. The Youtech is not called a triangle by Youtech, it just has a triangular shape and perhaps that is what gives it such a large sweet spot that makes placing your phone in a working position so easy.Best: Yootech triangle http://amzn.com/B00NWMI07SBest with height adjustment: Charging stand: http://amzn.com/B00UE9O0WQ3rd: Bamboo charger http://amzn.com/B00ZED4HMK4th: Anker http://amzn.com/B00Y839YMU","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDJMPFD7RWTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y839YMU#wasThisHelpful","R1JDJMPFD7RWTH","A15ML85W54A2AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ML85W54A2AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I built and owned a recording studio so I am more sensitive to sound quality than the average person. Of the three headphones, I purchased two of them at full price. I was given a discount coupon for an honest review of the Max Rock Soft Silicone headphones and got them for $1.00.This is my up-front summary of the three headphones.1. Max Rock Soft Silicone Headphone: Price $9.99. I paid with the discount coupon $1. Opinion: I want my dollar back.2. Max Rock Metal Headphones: Price $9.99. Opinion: Absolute BEST value for the money3. Klipsch Ri6 Headphones: Price $99.99. Opinion: Hard to decide which sounds best between the Max Rock Metal and Klipsch but with a 10X price difference the choice is a no-brainer.First, so we can get those out of the way and out of the picture, the Max Rock Soft Silicone Headphones. They sound terrible. The sound quality is like a muffled AM radio. You can hear the music but it is muffled in every frequency range. I got the solid green model. If you have streaks of red, yellow, purple and green in your hair then the green headphones will accent things beautifully. Otherwise the green looks cheap. The headphones feel cheaply made although I must admit they are as advertised - soft. The softness does make them comfortable in your ear but no more so than the silicone inserts the other two headsets and they actually don't feel as good as the other two headsets because they are floppy feeling in your ear. The major drawback with these headsets is simply that they sound terrible.If these headsets were waterproof, fireproof, zombie proof and doubled as a hacksaw then maybe those pluses would make it worthwhile in a survival situation. Otherwise the terrible sound simply is not worth it, even for a dollar. Enough said about the Max Rock Soft Silicone Headphones. Do not buy them.Next are the Max Rock Metal Headphones. They are the SAME price as the soft silicone but the sound, look and build quality is a world apart. They have clear bass, mid-range and decent highs. I switched between the Max Rock Metal and the Klipsch Headphones over a dozen times and could not decide which was better. They had different sound qualities but both were excellent. I purchased the Klipsch Headphones because a major consumer magazine rated them as a good value for the sound quality. The problem was they only tested rather high-end headsets. They did not test the Max Rock Metals.The sound difference basically is that the Klipsch maintains a more distortion free sound at maximum volume but the Max Rock is clearer sounding at a normal listening level. Both really sound good.The Klipsch is ten times the price of the Max Rock Metal. If I had not heard the Max Rock Metals then I would have thought the Klipsch was a good value but having heard the Max Rock Metal I am of a different opinion. If you want status, buy the Klipschs. If you want great sound quality, buy either. If you just hit the lottery for 100 million, buy the Klipschs. If your Amazon stock just went up in value a few million during the last week, buy the Klipschs. If you had lunch with Jeff Bezos recently and you bought him lunch because you've got more money, buy the Klipschs. They don't necessarily sound better, but they have a more prestigious name and status does matter to some.However, if you drive past three gas stations to save five cents a gallon and actually know what your bank balance is, buy the Max Rock Metal. If you want great value, buy the Max Rock Metals. Both headsets really have excellent sound but the price difference for similar sound is so vast that only the most stringent audio connoisseur will benefit from the sound difference and that's only if you think the Klipschs sound better. They sound different but it is objective as to which sounds better. After I listen for a few minutes I really can't tell which one I am listening to.I could not find the L or R marker on the Max Rocks and the L/R is super small on the Klipsch. The mic is on the left headset on both units so that makes it easy. The ear bud with the mic on the wire goes in the left ear. They should just say that in the instructions but neither headset tells you that simple fact that makes placing the headset in the correct ear easy.The wire on the Klipschs is a heavier gauge. This may make it more durable but it also makes it stiffer and heavier so that is a trade-off. If the wire does eventually break on the Max Rock, then you have nine more to buy before you equal the price of the Klipsch. I have more headsets lost the broken so in that respect the Max Rock definitely has the advantage of disposability.My recommendation, avoid the Max Rock Soft Silicone, buy the Max Rock Metal (or buy several pairs) and if you have money to burn and desire the status, buy the Klipsch Ri6.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JSFI6M7VHHFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGK8AS6#wasThisHelpful","R3JSFI6M7VHHFG","A15ML85W54A2AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ML85W54A2AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am one of the top 2,000 reviewers on Amazon. I get offers for multiple free products daily in exchange for an honest review. Even though I read quite a few books, rarely do I review books. I purchased this book after seeing a television interview with the author and was so impressed that I had to write a review.Most of us either need to make a change or change will be forced upon us. But how? What is the BEST way and thought pattern to either make change or handle change? Change Your Trajectory explains many of the changes and reasons for the changes that we so often face in life. But more importantly, Change Your Trajectory gives you the PRACTICAL HOW of what to do about it. The language and reasoning is clear and easy to understand and it is often the easy to understand stuff that is so powerful. It is not a question of IF you will need to make changes sooner or later, it is a question of when. Change Your Trajectory could be the difference when you face change of whether change boosts you or blasts you.This book is epic..","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H2W04XOHD04A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629115525#wasThisHelpful","R3H2W04XOHD04A","A15ML85W54A2AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ML85W54A2AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use these for the office staff. I've ordered several of them and they are used by the office staff to cook multiple meals daily. The units have never stopped working. I ordered more because the rice bowls became stained. Some of the staff used the for hot spicy foods and they left chilli sauce stains in the rice bowls. Soooo... I had to buy new units just to get new rice bowls. I notified the staff no chilli sauce in the rice bowls.My only complaint is there is no preset for the cooking time and it does not remember the last setting. I use 45 minutes. It starts at 20 minutes and then I must use the up arrows to increment to get to 45 minutes. Not a big deal but a remember last setting option would be nice.The clear steamer sections don't seem very durable but they have never broken or even chipped even with the constant office use. I am super pleased with these units.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFJT6PJGHBGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002SB8LPA#wasThisHelpful","R1KFJT6PJGHBGA","A15ML85W54A2AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ML85W54A2AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's like a tank for a phone. Both a gas tank and an armored tank.Pros:1. Battery life is phenomenal. It's roughly double the 3,000mah stock battery.2. Protects the phone. The case has a 3/16"" bevel that sticks out above the front glass of the phone. This provides better front glass protection than most cases.3. Rubbery non-slip surface. This makes it easy to grip in your hand without slippage.5. Very easy install one minute install.6. Solid back makes it suitable if you want to add a belt tab. I buy round belt clip tabs and glue it on the battery, drill a hole in the case and then stretch the tab through the drilled hole then clip the phone to my belt clip. It works great.To do this buy the tab and belt clip. Use 3M mounting tape #03609 (this is far stronger than the tape you get with the belt tab), drill a 3/8 hole in the case EXACTLY centered on where the tab will be. The hole is smaller than the tab so you must stretch the case hole over the tab. The case back will hold the tab in place because even the super strong mounting tape won't hold the tab long without a strong case back holding the tab also (believe me I've tried). With this case the tab has never come loose and you don't have to fear your phone popping off the belt clip and being lost or damaged.7. Case buttons work well with phone buttons. Pressing the buttons of the case is a solid feel and works easily with the phone buttons underneath.Cons:1. It's big and heavy. No, I mean really, this thing is big and heavy. It literally makes the phone feel 3X heavier. It's big. It's like an Otterbox case with lead inside. If you put your phone inside of your suit jacket and wish an unnoticeable bulge where you phone is, run, don't walk away from this battery. It doubles the thickness of your phone and increases the likelihood of your jacket or pants pocket bulging from the shear size of this phone. I've gotten used to the size and weight and actually like them both now. My hands are big and I'm strong so it works for me. If you have trouble opening doors, this phone is not for you.2. It takes double the time to charge. That figures if it's double the capacity but usually it's left on the charger overnight anyway.3. The battery level is no longer accurate. Maybe it's just my battery learning but it will drop to 95% in a few minutes yet take hours to move from 4% to 0. The battery meter is not smoothly linear. UPDATE: After the battery is conditioned a couple of weeks, the battery gauge us now accurate. To be honest, the battery meter doesn't matter. If you charge your phone at night, unless you play movies all day, your battery simply will never run to zero so a battery meter is almost unnecessary with this battery. On my heaviest use days I've always had 50%+ of battery left at the end of the day. With the stock battery it would go to zero on some days.4.  Your phone is no longer waterproof. Because this replaces the sealed back plate the phone is no longer waterproof. The front of the phone is still rather tightly sealed. It may remove the immersability of the phone but I think it will hold up well in the rain. Just don't go swimming with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9NQCPFZM7BRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKRUG34#wasThisHelpful","R9NQCPFZM7BRY","A15ML85W54A2AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ML85W54A2AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wondered, ""Where is the sweat going?"" Bikram Yoga is hot and during 90 minutes it seems as if I lose a half a gallon of sweat. A normal towels would be ringing wet but somehow this towel absorbs it all and still does not ""feel"" wet.When I received it I was initially disappointed because I thought it was a mat. It's not a mat, it's a towel. It's thin so it makes carrying a bulky towel obsolete.  It is fairly non-slip but it has very little cushioning so if you want a mat this is NOT it. It's a terrible mat but it's a great towel. You would use this to put over your mat.I received this product as a top reviewer. I get offers almost daily for free products to review but I accept very few of them simply because my time to review is often worth far more than the product and I don't review things that I don't use or would not potentially buy.

"Boy is this recorder great! I use it to record movies for quotes as a reviewer for MovieFoot.com and it works perfectly. I have purchased four of these for use by other reviewers on the team and all have worked flawlessly. Although my phone has an audio recorder it is nowhere as clear as the ICD-PX333 for recording sound in a theater. This recorder has a low cut filter and noise filter that makes the dialog much easier to understand during playback.Since I use the recorder to record movie quotes, I need to be able to go back to the exact point in the audio so that I can get it verbatim. That's where the T-MARK function comes in.When I hear a great quote, I press the T-MARK button and it places a bookmark at that point in the audio. What I later discovered is that when I copy the file from the recorder and open the MP3 file in Sound Forge (a Sony audio editing program), the bookmark shows up as a marker in Sound Forge. This makes it super easy to move from one bookmark to another and transcribe the quotes. I just back up a few seconds since I press the T-MARK button after the quote and there it is.It does not have a lighted screen but you don't want that in a dark theater anyway. You can set the record LED OFF or ON. I set it to ON but I put a piece of white tape over it. That way, it gives off a very dull glow so that I know it's recording but it's not so bright that anyone notices it.I can record about five or six movies (roughly 9-10 hours) before the battery indicator is down to one bar and then I put in 2 new AAA batteries.I also use this whenever I speak at functions with an Olympus ME-15 lavaliere microphone. It records speeches crystal clear and with the lapel microphone it records like a truly professional setup and the whole rig fits in a shirt pocket.Although I have a micro SD card I simply don't need it with the built-in 4GB of memory. At 128kbps (CD quality) the built-in memory gives you over 60 hours of recording.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZU79VP6UGXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOXNSRY#wasThisHelpful","R22ZU79VP6UGXP","A15ML85W54A2AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ML85W54A2AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This unit is fantastic! I wonder why dentists always mention the old fashioned string floss but rarely a water flosser? I believe the water flosser reduces your need for the dentist and has a much higher use rate once a person starts. Is it a conspiracy? I don't know but I do know the water flosser is not the best thing since sliced bread, it is BETTER than sliced bread. It will help remove the bread stuck between your teeth.PROS:1. Leaves your teeth and gums super clean.2. Actually is a joy to use.Once you use it for about a week, you ACTUALLY look forward to water flossing which is the opposite of string flossing.3. FAR MORE enjoyable than regular flossing. Yes, I needed to say that twice.4. It cleans between my teeth BETTER than regular flossing.5. At my last dental cleaning after a few months of the water flosser, there was literally nothing for the dentist to clean. Normally I have quite a bit of tarter and plaque that requires a lot of unpleasant scraping. So it cleans my teeth better, not just between my teeth.6. Simple to use. At first you may spray some water over the counter until you get the hang of it.7. Adjustable. You can adjust the force from 1 to 10. I use 10 and that's plenty powerful (I'm a macho non-squeamish man).Most will prefer the middle range.8. Quick. A tank of water lasts 90 seconds on level 10. In 90 seconds your mouth is clean.9. Relatively inexpensive for what it does.Cheaper than a pair of running shoes, four IMAX movies or the emotional turmoil from losing the love of your life because your teeth are messed up.10. Definitely increases my gum health by the massage action which flossing does not do. Some of the reviews gives you actual dental numbers of gum health. They state their gum numbers at the dentist improved from 5's and 6's to 2's and 3's (lower is better). I fully believe that. When I went back to the dentist after a few months of using the water flosser the dentist found virtually no tarter or plague on or between my teeth. Normally it is a good bit of very uncomfortable scraping but not after the water flosser.The dentist also said that my gums did no bleeding like they normally do when the dentist flosses during the cleaning. Although I did not have objective gum numbers, my gums are definitely in better shape.Cons:1. No truly small portable unit. Once I've gotten used to the water flosser I miss it when I travel.2. Somewhat noisy. If someone is sleeping in an adjacent bathroom, it will likely wake them up.3. Needs AC power4. Takes up counter spaceThere really aren't any significant cons that I can find on this unit.This is one of the best investments in my health that I have ever made.Both you and your smile will love this unit!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDFWEMDCY3W9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GLRREU#wasThisHelpful","R1HDFWEMDCY3W9","A15ML85W54A2AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ML85W54A2AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There were a few white creases where I had crushed the cup flat multiple times but absolutely no cracks. The cup remained watertight after being flattened 25 times.These cups are rugged!

"Write speed in real world conditions is my main concern. The drive writes at a consistent 80MB/s with Win 8 and USB 3 slots.I had to reformat the drive with NTFS file format because I needed to transfer files larger than 4GB.

The drive easily reformatted to NTFS which has a practically unlimited file size limit.I like that it does not have a removable (read can easily be lost) cap but a slide mechanism.

"I purchased seven of these and I am re-ordering more. The counters work perfectly. There is no solid click when you press the button but that's what I wanted. I use them to count laughs as a movie reviewer for MovieFoot.com. I needed a counter that didn't make noise. I put one on each hand and count my laughs on one hand and the audience laughs on the other hand. So far the counters have performed flawlessly.Even though there is no click, all that you need to do is solidly press the button and it increments each time. The reset button is very small and in the upper right corner so you don't risk accidentally resetting the counter. The display goes off in a few minutes to preserve battery power. When you press the counter button the counter increments by one and then turns on the display.There is no backlight so I can't see the count with theater lights off but I don't need to. I just note the count when the lights come on. You can read the display easily in sunlight. I'm ordering a bunch and will keep the spares in the refrigerator to make the battery last longer. They are so inexpensive it's probably cheaper to buy another unit than a battery even if the battery is replaceable.The finger strap is not the easiest to stay snapped but I bought several other counters that are much more expensive and they have the same type of finger straps so it is on par with the rest of the counters. You just have to make sure that you have the snaps really snapped in which takes some effort but once snapped in they stay snapped fairly well. I have large hands and I have plenty of snap holes left for expansion. They should fit any sized finger, especially larger hands.For less than $2 including shipping, I can't see where you can go wrong unless you get a defective counter and none of my seven were defective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCH5JY2MS6D34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DH96X8E#wasThisHelpful","RCH5JY2MS6D34","A15ML85W54A2AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ML85W54A2AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I was sent a pair of these wrist bands to review. I particularly agreed to accept the bands because I had recently hurt my wrist and had purchased three different wrist support bands to help my wrist heal. So I was a prime candidate to evaluate these.PROS:1. The biggest advantage is that they look great. The other bands that you buy in the Ace and Futuro look like medical devices. They make you look like you've hurt your wrist. These on the other hand make you look like a sports person who's going out for a hard workout. Big difference in the look.2. They are sturdy. They provide excellent support on par or better than all of the band EXCEPT those that have a metal strip. Those with a metal strip provides more support but of course much less flexibility. If you want to keep your wrist as still as possible, get a wrist band with the solid metal strip.3. Durable. I believe from the construction these will hold up over time.4. Economical. Two of these cost less than one wrist support band from the drug store.5. Great support. They support the wrist well, especially for sports activities.CONS:1. They are L/R specific. They are not ambidextrous bands which means you have one for the left and right wrist and they only fit the left and right wrist. This can be a problem for people who have trouble keeping up with things and you do have to take extra time to make sure that you've got the correct band on the correct wrist.2. The strap that goes over the web between the thumb and forefinger was less comfortable on one hand than the other supports. This may be because the other supports don't use a strap but the whole sleeve and the strap portion is wider and puts less per square inch pressure on the thumb web. Not a big issue but it is a difference.Overall, these are a super value, they look far better and they work well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G0EF5AU00R4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K9T3XSI#wasThisHelpful","R1G0EF5AU00R4E","A15ML85W54A2AH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15ML85W54A2AH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wish I could say I really like this pillow, it has very high reviews on Amazon, unfortunately it is not living up to the hype.  It was great the first 2-3 days, nice and lofty.  Now its so flat that each night I need to fluff it and then flip it over and I have to do this every couple of hours.  I'm a back sleeper and every morning I wake up with neck pains with this pillow.  (but it only started happening after it lost the loft to it).Let me also mention I buy a lot of pillows (much to my wife's dislike) I'm always buying new pillows trying to find the perfect combination of softness and loft.  I'd say in the last year I've purchase at least 4 different pillows.Also Marlow's Mercantile the company who makes this pillow says to contact them with any issues, though they don't give a way to contact them.  Going through Amazon, it basically says if there is an issue to contact Amazon and not the seller.  I even got an email a week after I got the pillow and it said at the end, ""If for any reason you aren't completely happy, please give me a chance to make things right before leaving negative feedback. Customer satisfaction is really my # 1 priority.  Kevin - Cofounder ""  Once again, no information on how to contact them.Anyways I did give the pillow 1 extra star as the bamboo cover is very nice and soft, also I did like the presentation (aka the pillow was rolled up in its own bamboo carrying bag).

" 0:08 Mins Received this Pack n' Play from my wife's parents for our first child.  I wish I could start off with the pros, but I really don't have any.First this Pack N' Play was ridiculously hard to put together.  You basically have to take 2 sets of 3 connected flexible tubes and slide them around the bassinet part so it is supported.  I'm not kidding when I state it took me at least 30 minutes to do this part.My next and biggest complaint is the changing table.  There is no support on the left side, so when you place your baby in the changing table, it will tilt to the left and your baby will roll and face plant into the side.  The odd thing is if you look at most of the Graco Pack N' Plays, they now have an extra little clip on the left side for this very purpose to keep the table flat, why it was omitted on this model is beyond me.  I even contacted Graco regarding this, I sent videos and photos to them and they basically came back with, ""confirmed the product is safe to use and continually tested to ensure this safety. ""  The changing station may be safe but its definitely a design defect.I have since purchased the Graco Smart Station Pack 'N Play and it is far superior in every way.Photo - https://www.dropbox.com/s/38i94invczr157j/IMAG0321-small.jpg?dl=0","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N8OOMGHJ2L8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHVR4OM#wasThisHelpful","R1N8OOMGHJ2L8F","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've owned ATI/AMD video cards as long as I can remember, I purchased this model as an upgrade from my Radeon 6870 model.  I'm a gamer but only tend to buy the mid-range line as I don't feel there are any games out there that are currently pushing my system to the limits.  I never go with a stock cooler video cards because they tend to be loud, and just look boring, so I tend to always get an overclocked model or one with a decent heatsink/fan.  HIS is well known for their IceQ coolers and this model is no different.With this card I am able to run Battlefield 3 on Ultra settings and getting about 40-45FPS most of the time running an Intel I7 3770k with 16GB (not overclocked).This card is amazingly silent I don't hear it spin up at all.  It is a ginormous card though.  I'm using a Corsair 600T case and this sucker just barely fits in it (because of where the hard drive cages are).AMD does a great job with the driver releases with a new set every month and they are very into player feedback and the community.I did have an issue getting my Mail-in-Rebate but that was not HIS's fault, I think it was because the date from Amazon was wrong since when I ordered it, it was on back order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBH9JIM0H77L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HYIRES#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBH9JIM0H77L","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own the CP1500AVRLCD and picked up the CP1000AVRLCD the other day for my wife's new 27 inch IMac.  Works great with the IMac, it list if the power goes out she has at least 40 minutes of power on this.  You don't need to install the software, but you do need to connect the computer with the USB cable as IMACs have built in UPS management software.  If you can get this model for under $90 its an amazing deal.My only dislike is this model is a bit bulkier then the CP1500 model.

"Ok, I'm going to be honest here, I'm 34 and enjoy playing with nerf guns.  Around $11 for a pack of 36 darts is a decent deal. The big issue is after using each dark multiple times it gets to the point where the dart is compressed and doesn't shoot as far, also the more times it sticks to the wall and you pull it off, eventually the suction tip falls off.P.S.  be careful, these sting when hit in the face with one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A9Y6XMPKBDSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00284C4FK#wasThisHelpful","R3A9Y6XMPKBDSQ","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried both the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power and the Schick Hydro Power, and the Gillette model is far superior, it just feels better on the face and produces a smoother shave.This is actually my 2nd Gillette Fusion Proglide Power as my previous one got water in the battery compartment and basically killed the battery and the electric system.  I like to use the razor in the shower so maybe they need to re-work the cap so it doesn't allow water inside.

"I actually bought 2 of these to replace some old builder grade chandeliers in my townhouse.  They are very nice looking, while I can't comment on the setup because I had a handyman install them he was able to get them installed pretty quickly.They recommend you use 3 100 watt bulbs for this chandelier, I think this is overkill, we put in 3 60 watt equivalent fluorescent bulbs and its extremely bright.  On a side note if you end up getting 100 watt equivalent fluorescent bulbs they are to large and wont actually fit in the chandelier correctly.  On other annoyance is the dome traps all sorts of bugs, flies etc and its difficult to clean, though this could be an issue with any chandelier where the bulbs don't face downwards.I also bought 2 AF Lighting 617602 Contemporary Lighting Collection Flush Mount, Brushed Nickel, lights which the design goes perfectly mounted near this chandelier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T62VD8UULHXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052SV3JW#wasThisHelpful","R3T62VD8UULHXZ","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying I did not purchase this camera from Amazon as I found it cheaper on another online store.  I have currently owned it about 3 months now.When I first started my search for an IP camera I was surprised by how many brands there were but also by how many bad reviews each one had.  I think most of the bad reviews are because setting these cameras up are not as user friendly as they could be so people get frustrated.  If you buy a camera like this model that has the cloud feature you can usually set it up pretty quickly, but a lot of them that you have to setup Port Forwarding will drive most people crazy.This isn't a bad camera per say, and its very sleek and cool looking and from a hardware perspective its great, but when it comes to the software it needs a lot of work.The reason I got this one was because it had all the features I wanted: Night Vision, Pan and Tilt, 2-Way Voice, SD card slot, extra high resolution.This being one of the highest resolution consumer grade camera's I thought the picture quality would be great.  Sadly I'm not even able to take advantage of the high resolution as according to Edimax ""one 1280x1024 camera equals 4.3 640x480 cameras in pixel count.  Streaming the max resolution over the Internet is virtually impossible for the average home.""The camera gives you the option to view in Mpeg,  Mpeg-4 or H.264 but there doesn't seem to be a way to specifically pick which one to use (unless you access it with the Admin Account).  According to Edimax only IE supports H.264, but since there is no way to specifically select it, I'm not sure its even working.Next their directions for port forwarding say open up ports, 80, 554, 50000-60000.  Why in the world does it need 10k port range open, and pretty much every ISP blocks port 80 from being opened so your forced to change the port to something else for that one.Finally their Android App is horrendous. Its very slow to load and somehow if you don't close it correctly you end up with multiple instances of it running.  I downloaded IP Cam Viewer Lite for my Android device and its far superior and much faster.I do have to say their Customer Service seems to be decent, the few times I emailed them I had a response back within a few hours.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B0IIUKLUPSAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089TCTG2#wasThisHelpful","R2B0IIUKLUPSAZ","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ordered this replacement for my Winix WAC9300 model, the medium size top of the line WINIX air purifier.  Not much to say about it other then it was poorly packaged.  When I opened it up the rubber stripping (that goes around the edge of the filter) was coming off.  This would be comparable to your door weather stripping which keeps stuff from getting around the filter.  Anyways I had to peeling it off and reapply the stripping around the filter before I could fit it into the air purifier.Other then that, the product works how it should, and for around the $60 mark for a replaceable filter that last a year isn't bad at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KRL0RJFCCKPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F4XK1C#wasThisHelpful","R2KRL0RJFCCKPL","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I bought these dental chews along with a bunch of other Tropiclean products as my dog has some serious bad breath and plague build up and we are unable to put him to sleep for a teeth cleaning because of a heart condition.First let me say my dog loves these, though he pretty much enjoys any treat, so I don't think its particular to these, he devours them pretty quickly.  These dental chews smell pretty gross, I almost gag every-time I open the bag.  But my biggest issue is the recommended feeding size.  A bag comes with 24 and the bag recommends for a 7lb-30lb dog giving them 4-8 a day.  If I would to give the max amount to my dog a dag I would need to buy a new bag every 3 days.  If I did the minimum amount each day, this bag would not even last a week.So far I've been giving my dog 1-2 a day along with some other Tropiclean products, and I can't tell that this product is doing anything worth wild.I'd have to buy 1 pack every week to fit their feeding recommendations, there are much better and cheaper teeth cleaning dental chews out there.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27C0FJATM0WNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DHH96K#wasThisHelpful","R27C0FJATM0WNP","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased this Mount for my living room to mount my new 46"" inch Samsung LED.  First of all the the price is great compared to most other Cantilever mounts on the market, though this particular model can be purchased online at a ""warehouse"" store for almost $20 cheaper then Amazon.The quality and construction seem great and was easy to install on the wall once the stud was found. Its very slim and my TV sits very close to the wall, but I can easily maneuver the TV out from the wall and face it towards the kitchen or dining room if need be.My only gripe with this mount was screwing in the extender plates so I could attach it to the TV (VESA 400 x 400), the directions were hard to decipher and the tools listed were not correct.  I ended up needing to use socket wrench and a screw driver to fully get the extender plates on the backplate.*edit*  Also the information is wrong on Amazon for the size this mount can handle, per MountWerks, the TV can hold up to 60 pounds and a 55 inch TV (assuming it has VESA 400 x 400 holes)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19SII0XD0DHG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HFJFLI#wasThisHelpful","R19SII0XD0DHG8","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this band set about 2 weeks ago to try to start doing some P90X,  I did not run into any missing items thankfully.  My biggest complaint so far is these bands have way to much metal on them,  there is a huge metal loop on the handles and then huge metal clips on each band,  When doing most exercises the metal rubs against your arms and is very uncomfortable.  Most other sets I've seen have very little or no metal, now this might make these more secure and stronger, but its at the sake of being uncomfortable.They do seem well built though and (knock on wood) I haven't had any issues with bands snapping or breaking.  The added CD is a nice touch and it shows you how to do a bunch of exercises and use the bands correctly, but I wish it had some actual workouts on it.

"Got my results the other day and they said my dog was a Mini Schnauzer and a Japanese Chin mix.  Taking one look at my dog you can easily tell he is mostly Chihuahua.  Sent an email to the company and got the below response:""Dear XXXXXX,Thank you for contacting Mars Veterinary, the creators of Wisdom PanelÆ Insights(tm), the best-in-class cheek swab DNA test for mixed-breed dogs.  We have received your comments regarding Tonka's  results and are sorry to hear our test did not meet your expectations. Tonka's profile shows that he is a very mixed dog and our computer had trouble identifying with confidence even the two great grandparents. A main point of our testing is that visual identification is almost impossible; even practiced vets are only able to correctly guess one breed about 30% of the time, and much less when they try to identify more breeds in a mix. This happens most often with supposed 'Lab mixes' because of their collection of dominant traits, making many combinations come together to resemble a Lab.With Tonka, he has such a wide variety in his mix (from Chihuahua and Japanese Chin to Boxer and Large Munsterlander) that he has a possibility for a vast array of different physical characteristics. However, since we were only able to identify one great grandparent with high confidence, this is grounds for a possible refund. Since you did not purchase the kit directly through us, you will need to obtain your refund through the distributor you bought it through.

"I bought a pair of UltraFit 3000 Orange/White off another online store, let me start out by saying the pictures made them look really snazzy, and they do in person.  When I first got them I attached the longer cord so I could take advantage of the play/pause and volume buttons on the control pod to use with my Ipod Nano.  I quickly realized something was wrong, the volume buttons did not work, I swapped the earphones over to my Iphone to see if it was a problem with my Nano, but same issue.  I sent an email to Polk and much to my surprise, they responded in less then 5 hrs and said they were sending me out a replacement piece, no questions asked.  So either this is a common issue or they have amazing customer service.  I got the replacement control piece and everything was working and actually they sent me a complete set of attachments for the headphones not just the broken piece.Now for my actual review:These earphones for $80-$100 seem cheaply made, just looking at the control pod with the mic, play/pause and volume buttons its not completely enclosed and looks like it will easily break, and there is also gaps on both sides, so while maybe the earphones are moisture resistant, I'm not sure what happens if this part gets wet.My next issue is the length of the cables and everyone else seems to have brought this up too, the cable with the control pod is way to long and the other cable is way to short.  The flat cable is a nice touch but it seems to make the cable a lot heavier then I'm used to.The sound quality doesn't seem to bad, initially I was really concerned that these had no bass to them, then I realized the earpieces I was using were not a good fit, when I switched them to a different size I could definitely tell a huge difference and the bass was much stronger.  Remember these are In-Ear Canal headphones, that means they actually need to be in the ear canal.(ie a good fit)If you can find these under $60 they might be worth it but at the current price I'm having a hard time recommending them.  I am giving Polk 1 extra star for their amazing customer service.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8X8MGFM00Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JXH1SC#wasThisHelpful","R2V8X8MGFM00Y1","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I previously have owned two of the Belkin SurgeMaster Wall Mounts without the USB ports so when I saw this model at a great price I jumped on it.  Being able to plug my Mobile devices in with just a USB cable is very convenient.My only beef with this model is they rotated all the outlets 90 degrees from the older model, so if you have a lot of plugs that are slim and wide, they end up covering over the middle outlets depending on how you plug it in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R6NKUNP4IBQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CLYJ0U#wasThisHelpful","R3R6NKUNP4IBQ3","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased the TEW-680MB last week for my living room, it was to replace my 4 year old Dlink DAP-1522.  This product is so much better and easier to use.  I have 4 devices in my living room connected to it:  LG TV, Xbox 360, Panasonic Blu-Ray Player, and my Onkyo Receiver.There is no lag at all between this device and my router (which is the Linksys E4200 V1) which is in another room.  I currently have it connected on the 5ghz band.  I love how you can see the details on the link quality and status by going to the status page of the device. (see below)  Even with the signal strength at 55% my link quality is at 98%.Extra Info  Link is UpChannel  149 <--> 5745000 KHz ; Central Channel: 151Link Speed  Tx  324.0(Mbps)  Rx  364.5(Mbps)Link Quality  98%Signal Strength  55%This device was so easy to configure compared to my old DAP-1522 and took me less than 5 minutes to setup.  When using my Xbox 360 as a Media Extender to play music and movies from my PC there is no lag at all, if I run the network performance test it list a HDTV quality link between the two so I know this device is working well because with the old device it was listed at a standard TV signal with the occasional spikes in signal loss.P.S.  Make sure you update the firmware on this device from Trendnet's website before you set it up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUGV3P0CORWDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0062K5JAI#wasThisHelpful","RUGV3P0CORWDJ","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is purely on the protein taste and mix-ability and serving size.First of all this stuff is expensive, I ordered the 2.2 lb container of Vanilla Bean.  First thing I noticed was it said 20 servings, the 2 lb container of their normal Gold Standard 100% Whey has 29 servings.  The scoop for the Platinum Hydro Builder is like twice the size of the Gold Standard yet they both say mix with 8-10 oz of liquid.  I tend to use fat free milk, when I put a scoop of the Hydro Builder in my shaker cup, I can sit there shaking it for 5 minutes and it doesn't fully mix,  There is a lot of powder on the bottom of the cup that doesn't seem to mix at all. Also the stuff that does mix seems to turn the milk very foamy and thick and its almost gross to drink.As for the taste, its ok but nothing to write home about, maybe I should have gotten the Chocolate since that's the flavor of the Gold Standard Whey I use and like.Also why does this stuff have 50mg of Cholesterol, seems like a little excessive, I'll probably just go back to the normal Gold Standard 100% Whey once I finish this container.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSPRP0ZBP0KY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RAT0JQ#wasThisHelpful","RSPRP0ZBP0KY3","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to give this toothbrush 5 stars, but I just couldn't.  It's not a bad device by any means but it's partly a step backwards from the Flexcare+ model and is it really worth the price?Let me start off by saying this is the 4th Sonicare Toothbrush I've owned.  I had the Essence, than the Flexcare, than the Flexcare+ and now the DiamondClean.If you have the Flexcare or the Flexcare+ do you really need to upgrade to this model?  Probably not, Sonicare's own website states you get a 44% better clean using the new DiamondClean heads, so the handle obviously makes no difference.Don't get me wrong the new handle is very cool, slick design, even slicker charging options, but did Sonicare have to remove features to do this?  For instance:The battery icon is now 1 solid icon rather than 3 different slices, now you can't tell when the battery is getting low.The button to change modes was removed, now there is one button for power and mode changing, this means unless you want to splatter toothpaste all over your mirror you need to change the mode in your mouth while trying to squint at the brush to see what mode it's on.Why was the UV cleaner removed?  Ok, I really didn't use this often but it was cool to know I had it.This toothbrush is very expensive, and your basically paying for the cool charging technology, and the absurdly overpriced new brush heads.  Currently a pack of 3 runs almost $35. In contrast a pack of 7 ProResults can be had at a big name Warehouse store for around $40.Also while putting your toothbrush in the cup for charging is cool, is that really practical?  If anything it's going to start making the bottom of the handle sort of gross, how many germs collect in that cup overnight unless you clean it every day.So in conclusion, cool charging technology does not take the place of convenience features.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P83I83KT5JD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052JN7XG#wasThisHelpful","R2P83I83KT5JD9","A1ZSSGME10WUJH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZSSGME10WUJH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased this on ebay, brand new got a great price, cleaned it thoroughly and the first time I used it I almost threw up.  There was a very very harsh plastic taste.  I emailed Camelbak, they said try cleaning it with lemon juice.  Tried that and it didn't help, then I emailed the person on Ebay, he said try cleaning it with baking soda, tried that and no luck.  Emailed Camelbak again and they told me to return it to the seller (which I obviously can't do now), Camelbak said they could not replace it since they had no extras.After playing around with it a little more I think I've actually determined the bad plastic taste is coming from the cap, so now I just take off the top before drinking.

"For the price, these are good.  They have a little bit of a cheap feel to them, but the sound quality is quite good and the glowing green definitely makes them look pretty cool.They are surprisingly lightweight, which allows you to wear them longer without discomfort. I do wear glasses sometimes and I did notice the pressure on the ear pieces of my glasses a bit more than I do with my other headset, so I think they do squeeze a bit tighter (which in theory provides a bit better noise isolation).I also tried these out as regular headphones on my MacBook pro using the included wire.  The wire is too short to have much range of movement and I noticed a constant feedback with them.  So, I can't really recommend them for use as a regular headphone replacement, at least with a MacBook (which shouldn't be too surprising).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZFKR8SKQQWRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016K122XU#wasThisHelpful","RZFKR8SKQQWRR","A2J8DE8R94ZB02","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8DE8R94ZB02?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is what I would call a backpacker's ultralight tripod for a photo enthusiast, but you probably need to be gentle with it. What does that mean? Well, it means the thing is small enough and lightweight enough to consider trekking up a mountain or on a multi-mile hike, but not sturdy enough to take much of a beating. The general feel of flimsiness and concern about its ability to support larger cameras is the reason I knock one star off. Otherwise, I quite like it.It is surprisingly full featured with adjustments for nearly every angle and even include quick release pad so you can quickly switch between mounting it and holding it. It won't replace my more heavy duty tripod for normal use, but I can easily see myself taking in along when space is tight or for day hikes with my family.  I also just got back from Japan and there were a number of places that I kind of wished I had a tripod with me.

"This is the 2600 mAh version. This means it has a single power out and really can only fully charge a cell phone once.  Some of the reviews are for the 7600 mAh version which looks a lot better to me.This 2600 mAh isn't as compact as I think it could be.  I just used a panasonic device that was more compact and had at least this much battery life.  It also has a button on it which I cannot figure out what it really does.  There is an absolutely terrible pictogram in the instructions that don't make sense to me for what the button function is.Overally, this works as an okay backup for a single device and is a good way to carry around a bit of a life saver for whatever devices you may need in the course of the day.

"I was a little skeptical, because I have about 5 other camping air mattresses and I am rather picky.  However, I have to say that this is a great backpacking mat when you are concerned about size and weight. When I'm not as concerned about weight, I'll still go with my other pads for a bit more comfort.I am a side sleeper, so I was very skeptical that I wouldn't be digging my hip into the ground.  This is only the case if you don't inflate it fully. For other mats I have usually found that I need to have them slightly deflated to feel the best. With this one, if you turn on your side when it isn't fully inflated, your hip (at least mine) would manage to find the empty pockets.  So, just inflate it fully and no problem.Air nozzle is nice.  It has to be pulled in a certain direction to take or lose air, making it easy to inflate without scrambling to close it.The mat is quiet. No much rustling around, disturbing everybody around you.

"This is a very entry level computer that fits the bill for what I wanted to do with it - web browsing / word processor for the kids.  However, it comes with bloatware that really slows it down. Honestly, at this price, don't expect more than what you are getting.The first thing you probably should do is install the latest Ubuntu over top of it and get rid of Windows 8.1.  This is easy to do.  Just get a bootable desktop ubuntu USB from their website.  This will give you a basic desktop operating system without bloatware, but also include some free office replacements (Libre Office). It isn't necessarily something for everybody, but I got my kids setup with it and it works great.You can then give them their own limited rights account and set them up with Firefox.  I also installed an extension on Firefox that let's you blacklist or whitelist specific websites.  In addition, you want to set up that computer to use Norton connectsafe DNS server.  This is really easy to do and I would give you a link if Amazon didn't strip those out.  Just google it.  You can have different levels of protection and you can really turn it up high to prevent them from going to undesirable web sites.And just like that, you'll have a very serviceable web browser / homework computer for the kids.As for out of the box, this thing isn't particularly usable due to too much bloatware on it.

If I tried to force a clip to close, it would just snap right back open.On the plus side, Amazon gave me a full refund.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DTM21TD56MA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009H51MG#wasThisHelpful","R1DTM21TD56MA7","A2J8DE8R94ZB02","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8DE8R94ZB02?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very mixed on whether this should be a 3 star or 4 star review.  I've decided to give it a 3 star review because, frankly, I had to keep googling youtube videos to figure out how to do things that should be very easy to do.  Once you figure out how to do it, then you realize how powerful the editor is.This year I've created projects with Cyberlink PowerDirector and iMovie.  Not surprisingly, when you just want to quickly put together some clips to post to facebook, iMovie wins.  Next up, I like power director, but it is only slight ahead of Pinnacle Studio.One really nice thing is that it has a lot of built in transitions and effects.  I found the export menu to be one of the easier menus I've used.I liked the clip editor screen quite a bit (after I youtubed a tutorial).  However, I used color and brightness correction on a snow video (sledding) and the final result didn't look very good.  It really struggled to properly correct the snow.One thing I really didn't like is that the effects / transitions labeled ""GPU"" wouldn't preview render for me at all.  This is very annoying, especially since I have a Radeon r9 270x GPU.  I also pulled up the GPU monitor when doing export and as far as I could tell it never even used the GPU.  I do have an i4770 CPU, which it pegged at 100%. So, as far as I can tell from reading the documentation, you have to have a Nvidia GPU or you will not get any advantage from your GPU.All in all, this product didn't leave me especially unhappy with it or very excited about it. In other words, I don't see much of anything that makes it stand out as an obvious winner.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54Y57W4VFY13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OW2PHDM#wasThisHelpful","R54Y57W4VFY13","A2J8DE8R94ZB02","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8DE8R94ZB02?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I have used this for:Mountain biking on some trails in Colorado.  Plan on using it for hiking and snowshoeing.My favorite part of this device:It works in both the dark and direct sunlight. Even on a completely sunny day with fresh snowfall (super bright), I can clearly see the screen.What I won't use:The pedal attachment for pace setting.  That isn't something I'll use mountain biking.  If you are a road biker, then perhaps it would be more useful to you.What else I like about it:This unit has water proof certification up to about 3 feet of immersion, so I don't have to worry about dropping it in mud, splashing water in it, or dropping it in the snow. It is lightweight.  It has a cool ""Surprise me feature"".  Just set your destination or workout goal and it will give you a few route options to choose from.What I don't like about it:No bluetooth to connect to your phone or computer (you need to look at the next model up).  The resolution on the maps is pretty low compared to my phone.  Entering a destination is a lot slower than entering it on my phone and it didn't have a relative's street listed in it.  Loading maps is way harder than just using google mytracks or pre-caching google maps on my phone. It doesn't come with a clip attachment so that I can just easily attach it to my backpack strap for quick reference. Even if I did want to use it for my car, it refuses to provide directions for a destination more than 125 miles away.This device really is pretty good. It has a mostly dedicated purpose (biking).","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VI9CAK5CTTWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KT7DOUM#wasThisHelpful","R3VI9CAK5CTTWB","A2J8DE8R94ZB02","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8DE8R94ZB02?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My kids love the thing. It glows in the dark (ball, net, hoop, outline of backboard), which definitely enhances the cool factor.  it is made of quality materials. It is light years better than a typical cardboard and plastic over the door hoop.However, the breakaway rim is too tight.  When I pull down on it, the entire plexiglass backboard bends almost more than the rim spring gives.  Speaking of which, there is no vertical stabilizer bar on the backboard which makes me afraid that one of these times the kids are going to hang on the rim and break it.  Yes, I've broken plexiglass before, so, I know it can happen.It fits pretty well over the door, but not perfectly. I have to force the door shut, which make me think it will end up warping the door.Putting together isn't hard, but I did give up on using the little included sheet metal wrench and just grabbed a socket wrench.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ASLXZZ1WM4U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCYUPBM#wasThisHelpful","R3ASLXZZ1WM4U5","A2J8DE8R94ZB02","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8DE8R94ZB02?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The unit overall is pretty nice looking and fits in well with my stainless steel kitchen. It is much smaller than I thought it would be and actually will probably retain a permanent position on the counter top. The only downside is that the three dials give it more of a retro look, rather than a modern look.  The function is also rather retro with having to turn the dial all the way to the right and then back to start cooking.For toasting bread quickly I'll probably stick with our regular toaster for most jobs.  This is slower, and I didn't notice any real difference in terms of even toasting.  That said, this does seem to have more fine tunability over the degree of toasting. Every toaster I've ever had gives a wide range of toasting, but they always seem to really burn the toast if you go even slightly past the lowest setting.  This toaster doesn't suffer from that.Where this shines is the ability to bake or reheat small meals, like a 9"" pizza. And if you are willing to wait a few minutes, deliver a much more pleasant reheated piece of pizza than the microwave. We also use the individually frozen cookies and can bake just a few at a time without heating up the giant regular oven - perfect!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7FPCGO36YLI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FN3MV88#wasThisHelpful","R7FPCGO36YLI2","A2J8DE8R94ZB02","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8DE8R94ZB02?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know, the kind of cooking shows on TV where they say a meal only takes 20 or 30 minutes to make, except they leave out the fact that they had an entire team prepping everything for 1 hour before the chef started actually making it? Yep. So the chef goes on the show, and chops a few herbs just to make it look like they actually did some of the cooking themselves. And when they chop those herbs, what do they use? Exactly! A Santoku knife! So if that's the ONE piece of equipment they're actually using on the show, it must be important, right? Ever since I started watching those cooking shows I've been wanting a knife this this, so I had to get one!And I must say I'm beyond happy with this knife. It's a ""mini"" but I've found it's just perfect for most jobs in my kitchen so far. I've used it for herbs (of course), lettuce, avocados, small veggies, small pieces of meats, you name it. It's sharp and precise. It's easy to grip and hold, and comfortable in my hand. It cleans easily. And now I feel professional!

"I have been in love with Skip Hop designs ever since I bought their owl backpack for my daughter a few years ago. I got it before they went mainstream (into major department stores and Amazon) and had to buy it from a little boutique online so I was so excited to see this cute little duo on Amazon! I think she will love subbing out her owl for this penguin. It has bright colors, the decorations are stitched on strongly, the zippers work well. It was a bottle pocket and a mesh pocket within the little front pouch too, so has a few extra places to stash their tiny treasures.She is still using her owl pack after 4 years, so based on my experience, I can say these packs are:- High quality: strong sturdy materials, the decorations are integrated really well, made of good materials.- Durable: It has held up with daily use and preschool projects and lots of airplane travel in the past 4 years!- Sized perfect for kids: the size and weight is perfect for kiddos. I just wish the corners weren't quite so rounded because you do need to slightly flex a letter-sized paper at the corners to be able to zip up the pack- Cute! The kids love picking their characters to wear. It's not just a printed-on disney design. It's like a little friend to them!I would highly recommend any backpack that Skip Hop makes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SJVUNVVT3PHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JY6QZRI#wasThisHelpful","R2SJVUNVVT3PHD","A2J8DE8R94ZB02","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8DE8R94ZB02?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I struggled between three and four stars. It is an innovative, smaller alternative to standard power strips, but after deliberation, I have to knock it down to 3 stars because of two things:1) One side of the cube is pretty much useless in all but one configuration.  Whether you have lying flat on a floor / desk or mounted under a desk, one of the outlets will not be usable.  Not unless you want this weird, off balance cube with cables coming out in all directions.  So, realistically, it is only 3 usable plugs. The only way you get all 4 plugs is if you have the cube mounted such that the cable goes through whatever it is mounted to.2) It only has 2 USB outlets. In today's world, 2/3rds of my devices can be plugged in directly to USB without a clunky adapter.  This could really use a couple more USB outlets.  Perhaps the internals of the device don't allow room, but it certainly seems to have external surface area for more.That said, it is relatively attractive, seems solidly built, and has a very sturdy cable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7A4HE9N22EQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPNH4LC#wasThisHelpful","R7A4HE9N22EQG","A2J8DE8R94ZB02","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8DE8R94ZB02?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We thought this headphone kit was a great way to disguise learning as a hands-on project. Not only that, but kids get to actually put it to use afterwards and have the gratification of having built it themselves and knowing how it works instead of just buying it at the store. The booklet has a fun book-like look to it with facts and photos and is in full-color. This is key since it doesn't seem like a boring black-and-white adult instruction manual. We had to help my son with assembly. The age is ""8 and up"", so the ""up"" kids could probably do it without help.The finished product doesn't have amazing sound, but that wasn't expected. One star off for the sound quality.  The construction of the headphones is on the ""cheaper"" side, and they probably won't last with use from a normal active child.

"Solid performance, low power consumption and runs cool!I bought this to upgrade an EVGA 680.  Not only does the 980 have double the pixel rate of the 680, it does it while using less power (165w vs 195w) and running about 10C cooler.  Simply amazing.This is the ""reference"" card, which out-of-the-box is a bit slower than the ""superclocked"" versions.  However, you can increase the GPU and Memory clocks via EVGA's free ""PrecisionX"" software.This is my third EVGA branded NVidia card.  Why EVGA?  Go spend some time on their forums, and see how they handle things like firmware problems and RMAs.  I've never had a problem, but it is comforting to know the support is there if I ever do.  And investigate their ""step up"" program, where anytime within 90 days you can upgrade to a different product for just the price difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z2AV2D8DANLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI5NCRW#wasThisHelpful","R1Z2AV2D8DANLZ","A3U2P99WZMO6TV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U2P99WZMO6TV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The purpose of a charger case is to provide additional runtime, and this case does that very well.A standard Lighning receptacle at the bottom is used to charge the case battery.  While charging, there are (4) indicator lights which progressively light from right-to-left as the battery charges.  Four solid lights indicate the case is fully charged.  Rated at 4100mAh, this case will roughly double an iPhone runtime.Inside, there is a Lightning connector that engages the iPhone's Lightning receptacle when you slide the iPhone into the case.  This connector provides full data pass-through, so you can Sync the iPhone while in the case.  There are sufficiently-sized cutouts for the iphone camera, flash, speakers, headphone jack, and volume/mute controls.Battery power is engaged by a momentary press of the switch, located on the front of the case at the lower right corner.  As with charging, the (4) indicator lights show the current charge level of the case battery.Useful for more than just iPhones...  There is also a standard USB receptacle on the right side of the case.  This is a power output that can be USED WITH ANY USB DEVICE.  For example, I have used it to charge a Bluetooth headset, and it could also be used to charge any other phone using that phone's USB cable.The case does add some weight/bulk to the iPhone, but that is unavoidable with any battery case. If you need extra runtime, a little extra size/weight is a reasonable tradeoff to avoid a dead phone.The case does have some flaws.  First, I found it very difficult to use iPhone's the volume up/down buttons and mute switch while in this case, as the cutouts are deep and slightly mis-aligned. The kickstand is unstable, and only works if you have a perfectly level surface and no vibration or movement -- otherwise, the case will fall over.  Finally, the USB socket at the right bottom corner has some pretty sharp corners, and this can make holding the case uncomfortable.This case does what it promises, housing an iPhone and approximately doubling runtime. However, difficulty accessing volume/mute controls, the unstable kickstand, and the sharp corners of the USB socket are significant flaws that make daily use problematic. If you need a battery case every day, I suggest looking at other products and paying a bit more.  But at this price point, the case is an excellent value and functions very well for the occassional need to extend battery life.

"VERY happy with this shredder!  It is amazingly quiet, and the micro-cut particle size is very secure.  An added benefit of the small particle size is greater bin capacity -- compared to a cross-cut with the same size bin, the micro-cut particles pack together better and that means more pages per bag.  Staples are no problem.  The instructions for credit cards are contradictory, but credit cards CAN and SHOULD be run through the same slot as paper, where they get micro-cut for security.  The smaller ""strip cut"" slot is only for CD/DVD media, and does a great job as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5I6HZ8ASGLZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JE7780#wasThisHelpful","R5I6HZ8ASGLZC","A3U2P99WZMO6TV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U2P99WZMO6TV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is reasonably tough against abrasion and very resistant to heat. When soldering, there was no deformation or shrinkage of the insulation.I measured the stranded bundle at approximately 0.138"" diameter.

"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from a fresh new Bible designed for women but decided to give this a try anyway as my personal Bible is in tatters.  I discovered it is a regular New International Version of the Bible that has some essays from women writers I personally never heard of but I assume are important in Christian circles.  The essays are sprinkled throughout the Bible in an attempt to help women relate with the ancient messages.  There are some brief biographies of the contributors, a well rendered topical index and several blank pages for notes at the back of the book.  I am for anything that encourages people to read especially the wisdom of past generations and  that contributes to a healthy spirituality so I endorse this volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CFSKPB8ML5KQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310409462#wasThisHelpful","R3CFSKPB8ML5KQ","A2ZHH7AK83JB5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I suppose I should have known with dimensions of 17"" by 24"" how small this bathroom rug would be but the actual size did take me by surprise.  In a very tiny bathroom this minute rug might work very well as it does provide more than enough enough space for an adult to stand on when emerging from the bath/shower.  I do like the color (I got yellow) and the ""popcorn"" texture feels great to stand upon and I also like the way it looks.  I have not had the rug that long  but the longevity of some other items I have had from the DII company has not been lengthy as while serviceable their products from my past experience are not particularly durable are of high quality.

In between though we have characters living in places such as North Dakota, Florida, East Texas, New York City, Nebraska, and more.

"I've been following Jonathan Kellerman's series of mysteries starring psychologist Dr. Alex Delaware that are set in LA and its environs for years.  While Kellerman's new book THE MURDERER'S DAUGHTER does make a few mentions of Delaware the star here is  Dr. Grace Blades a superwoman psychologist who can solve the most traumatized patient's needs, track and fight bad guys, pick up strangers for anonymous sex and is the heir to millions of dollars.Life did not start all that well for Grace who we are told has a super high IQ.  Her biological parents were neglectful no hopers living in a trailer court in the Southern California desert.  One eventually killed the other and then committed suicide leaving little Grace to a series of foster homes.  She finally finds a good home with an elderly foster mom on a former movie ranch but when some disturbed children from a cult come to stay there too a very handicapped foster brother ends up murdered and the foster mom has a heart attack from shock.  But Grace is soon taken in by a pair of older and wealthy Jewish psychologists who eventually send her to Harvard and grad school plus make her their heir.Grace is wildly successful in her practice specializing in treating people who have been traumatized by terrible events and especially those who have relatives who are murderers.  One of the kids from the cult comes back in to her life first as a one night (or actually hour) stand, then as a patient and ends up dead with other bad guys chasing Grace from LA to Berkeley.  You have to suspend quite a bit of disbelief to believe in the sometimes almost silly plot but Kellerman's California descriptions are always worth reading.  I have a feeling this may be the start of a new series for Kellerman though he is still pushing out the Delaware books and has started a new golem series with his son Jesse.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35WDKAL1NTA9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545311#wasThisHelpful","R35WDKAL1NTA9C","A2ZHH7AK83JB5G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""A Touch of Death"" was originally published in 1953 and re-released as part of the outstanding Hard Case Crime series in 2006.  It's another compelling crime noir from a master author.  The protagonist is Lee Scarborough, a former college football star who has hit on hard times.  He's barely scraping a living as a salesman, when he meets a young woman with a plan.  She knows about a hidden cache of money, and she needs Lee's help to get it.  Of course, there's more here than meets the eye, and Lee soon finds himself running from the law.Williams' work here is top-notch and loaded with the kind of hard-boiled language and descriptions characteristic of the genre (""You knew she could turn on the honey-chile like throwing a switch at Boulder Dam."").  Lee is a typical crime noir character - he's not inherently bad, but he's willing to do some bad things to survive.  Of course, this type of book always has a gorgeous femme fatale, and ""A Touch of Death"" gives us three, focusing on a lovely widow (Madelon Butler) who may or may not have murdered her husband.  Madelon is a sociopath of the highest order, and the character is fascinating.  Another winner from Hard Case Crime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CKEQH7R15J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093FK5US#wasThisHelpful","R3CKEQH7R15J4","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Social problems are common across a wide variety of adolescent mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, ADHD, autism, and so forth.  In addition, many adolescents who do not have any overt psychopathology also experience difficulties with social situations.  Thus, books such as ""The Science of Making Friends"" are much needed in the field, especially those that focus on evidence based approaches.  The author has much experience treating these problems at UCLA's PEERS Clinic.  The book can be used by many different populations, including clinicians in the field, but it has also been written so that parents can use it directly to help their adolescents.""The Science of Making Friends"" starts with a consideration of why social skills and relations are so important.  This chapter helps parents and others understand the context of the problem and provides much practical advice, including how parents using the book can introduce it to their adolescents.  Chapter two explores what makes a good friend and how to go about finding them.  This section is well-considered and discusses the role of shared interests in friendships.  Again, practical activities are described to help parents and adolescents navigate this area.Subsequent chapters get into the nuts and bolts of social skills training, including good conversations; starting, entering and exiting conversations; and handling problems such as verbal teasing, arguments, and rumors/ gossip.  It's great to see that a brief chapter even addresses the rising problem of cyberbullying.  These sections are loaded with information.  Each social skills is described in detail and parents are provided with 'coaching tips' along with case studies of 'success stories.""  Fortunately, the tips are developmentally-sensitive, acknowledging that good social skills for adults differ from those for adolescents (she calls them 'contextually relevant').  For example, one chapter examines electronic communication.  This section, though, is perhaps a bit shallow and focuses more on safety issues rather than social skills.  However, I think overall that this book is a solid addition to the arena of adolescents social relations and could be helpful to many families.The book is accompanied by a 30-minute DVD of role-play demonstrations of the social skills described in the book.  Each skill is followed with a series of questions to help the audience reflect on the skills.  The quality of the DVD is fine, although the scenarios are obviously filmed in what looks like a very formal medical library and the actors seem to be graduate students.  However, seeing these social skills in action unquestionably could be helpful for many adolescents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L134XGN946F5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118127218#wasThisHelpful","R3L134XGN946F5","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It can be used for all kinds of kitchen tasks, including basting a roasted turkey (the most obvious task), transferring liquids, or moistening items while they are grilling.

Instead of putting it in a drawer, I store my baster upright in a container with my ladles and spatulas.

"""Stoner"" is another re-discovered should-be-a-classic from the New York Review Books Classics series.  Why this book is not better known is a mystery to me.  It tells the story of William Stoner, a farmer's son in the early 1900s who is encouraged to go to college by the local county agent.  The plan is for Stoner to attend the new agricultural school at the University of Missouri and then return home with ideas to help his father's hardscrabble farm survive.  Instead, he unexpectedly falls in love with literature and decides to stay for a graduate degree and then to teach.The book is a revealing character study of the type of person who we all know ‚Äì a passive man who allows life to happen to him without ever doing much of note or taking control of his destiny.  Stoner rarely reflects much about his life or what he wants, and as a result, he rarely succeeds.  ""Stoner"" is written in a direct, simple style that belies the depth of the writing.  Nevertheless, this is a story that is likely to resonant with many people.  The supporting characters are also wonderfully etched with great details, and so many scenes are heart-breakingly realistic.  For example, his parents confusion (and ultimately shame) when Stoner decides to stay at college is gorgeous in its lack of sentimentality.As a professor who went to Mizzou, I was struck time and again by how accurately Williams paints the academic life.  Too often, books about academics are breezy comedies filled with handsome professors wooing beautiful co-eds while getting entangled in hilarious scenarios.  I wish it were that exciting!  Instead, ""Stoner"" depicts the drudgery and pettiness of the academic life.  Where professors don't speak to each other for decades and use their students as pawns.  As such, ""Stoner"" can be a bit of a depressing read; however, I found it all so overwhelmingly brilliant that it was an uplifting experience.  ‚ÄúStoner‚Äù is a must-read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2JC67WW2RYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003K15IF8#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2JC67WW2RYB","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most of the best-known cuisines of the world are represented here.

I think that if you're planning a trip to a country included here, then this book would provide a nice overview of what you need to know about the cuisine.

"I've become a big fan of Japanese-based pen company, Pilot Pens.  Their products are all first-rate; I've never had any problems with them.  The Acroball Medium Point (1.0) are a real highlight.  The hybrid ink allows the pens to write as smoothly as gel pens, but the ink looks and dries like a ballpoint pen.  The pens are designed with comfort in mind -- the barrel narrows right where you hold the pen, and the rubber overlay makes the pens easy to hold.  I love how they look and feel.Because they are Medium Point, the writing is bold and prominent with beautiful, bright ink.  This packet comes with five colors green, purple, orange, light blue (turquoise), and pink.  I love using the purple, green, and orange pens to correct student papers as the ink stands out brightly against black type.

"""Labor Day"" is a lovely, moving story of a 13-year-old boy (Henry) coping with his depressed mother (Adele) in a small New Hampshire town.  Henry's parents are divorced, and the two live like hermits - rarely venturing out except to stock up on easy-to-keep foods (canned soup, frozen fish sticks).  Clearly, the divorce was hard on Adele, but she was already spiraling downward long beforehand.  Things take a dramatic turn, though, when they encounter a stranger, Frank, at a local store.  Frank has a dark past, but Henry and especially the extremely lonely Adele overlook it.  The book tells about the events that happen over the next few days - a languid, hot Labor Day weekend.Joyce Maynard is clearly talented; a lesser author could not take the somewhat unbelievable main plot and turn it into such a surprisingly sweet, gentle story.  She manages to make Adele a sympathetic, multi-faceted character, even when her judgment borders on the ludicrous.  Adele's desperation to be loved, and Henry's desire for an accepting father figure are palpable, even though one must suspend disbelief a few times along the way.  ""Labor Day"" is not the kind of book I typically read, but I'm glad that I did.  It was skillfully written, touching, and had complex characters.  This is top-notch contemporary writing.  I can't wait to see how Kate Winslet interprets the role of Adele in the upcoming movie adaptation.Note: This review is for the Kindle version.  The ebook has been formatted and transferred extremely well, with no obvious errors.  It also includes a table of comments with links to individual chapters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IEZ94PWSUWB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HPRBZS#wasThisHelpful","R3IEZ94PWSUWB2","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mead Weekly Planning Desk Organizer is a clever product that can be used by busy professionals at work or by anybody wanting to be more organized.  It consists of a file folder holder with 5-slots - one for each day of the work week.  Two stickers are included for the front panel; one lists the days of the week (Monday through Friday), and the other is blank and can labelled however you like.  For example, students could label each slot with a different class, or parents could label each slot for a different family member.  I applied the Monday through Friday sticker, and I really love it.  I can put everything I need for each day into the slots as reminders to work on various projects throughout the week.  It seems particularly suited to teachers, as you could put your course prep and handouts for each day into the slots.  The system is really flexible and can adjust to your needs.  For example, it can be used to sort mail (outgoing, junk, bills, etc.) or to leave messages for different family members.The only drawback is that the holder is somewhat cheaply made. For something that is likely to receive a lot of daily wear and tear, it should be made of plastic or wood.  Instead, it's made of hard cardboard covered in paper.  The green paper covering already had started to come off when it arrived - I'll try gluing it back on to last longer.  Otherwise, I really like this useful file holder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC8L8SARE1RC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2YCJLO#wasThisHelpful","RC8L8SARE1RC7","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cook's Illustrated is my favorite cooking magazine, and I purchase nearly every cookbook they publish.  The magazine picks a small number of dishes each issue and has experts try various recipes and variations in order to develop the 'perfect' version of each dish.  I have never been disappointed when I've tried their recipes.  They also focus on trying to make dishes relatively easy for home cooks.Their cookbooks follow the same pattern.  They always explain their process and what worked and did not work.  I have to admit that I am not a big fan of baking -- I prefer cooking, especially things that are hard to mess up, such as soups.  However, when I do bake, then I turn to Cook's Illustrated because of the perfection of the recipes.  I love this latest cookbook from them, which focuses on baking.  It includes every type of baking you can imagine, from quick breads to custards, including some savory pastry, such as pizza crust, rolls, and quiche.  The authors also include a nice section covering the products they use, including pans and ingredients.  As always, this cookbook is a first-rate product that makes cooking easier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VK2M1WOFJIT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936493586#wasThisHelpful","R3VK2M1WOFJIT7","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was a child, Clue was always my favorite board game.  My older siblings always played it with me on Christmas Eve, so it brings back special memories.  The game is fairly simple and can be played with ages 8 years and older.  Most of you have probably played it before, but if you haven't then the basic goal is to identify a killer.  A murder has been committed in a grand old mansion, and players need to identify who committed the murder, in which room, and with which weapon.  You do so by asking players questions and getting clues.  The game is great for children and adolescents because they have to think critically and also not be impulsive.  If you guess too soon, then you're likely to be wrong and lose the game.This version is the 'classic' game, with the old graphics and pieces.  The game has changed a bit over the years, so I'm really happy to have this classic version.  Clue is a fantastic, fun game that every household should have in its game cabinet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24G19T62ULX3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00349MPQQ#wasThisHelpful","R24G19T62ULX3I","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Monopoly is perhaps the most iconic board game out there.  Most everyone has played it before.  For those who have not, the basic idea is that players move around the board trying to buy properties and avoid properties owned by other players.  If you land there, then you have to pay ""rent.""  The winner is the last person with money -- everyone else eventually goes bankrupt.  It can be a long, intense game, which can be fun or irritating, depending on your mood.  I love it personally.This version is a return to basics -- the old iconic Monopoly.  Over the years, minor changes have been made to the game, mostly in the way it looks and so forth.  Also, special versions have been released.  I like this basic, classic version because it brings back nice memories of playing Monopoly with my family.Monopoly is a great game for players 8 years and older.  It helps children and adolescents learn how to count money as well as budgeting issues.

"I teach a course on Family Therapy, so I am always looking for resources on working with different types of families.  Therefore, I was thrilled to receive ""Working with Adoptive Parents: Research, Theory, and Therapeutic Interventions.""  The editors are two clinical psychologists, Virginia Brabender and April Fallon, and they have gathered together a variety of mental health professionals who contributed chapters.The chapters cover important issues, including parent-child attachment issues, diversity needs, children with special needs, and therapy suggestions.  The book is research-based, so the authors cite research evidence throughout the text.  In addition, they often use case studies to illustrate important points.  The book plays well to its intended audience by ending chapters with an extremely useful set of ""Practical Points"" that summarize the main take-away points.  The book primarily relies on attachment and emotion theory, which makes sense given the population it targets.  However, I would have liked a bit more incorporation of empirically supported treatments; for example, a discussion of behavioral techniques for child acting out problems could be useful for many adoptive parents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FWLLS0673MN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118109120#wasThisHelpful","R38FWLLS0673MN","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the classic board games I played as a kid, such as Sorry.  It's the kind of game that you can play at any age and enjoy (it's recommended for ages 6 years and up).  For the uninitiated, Sorry is a board game where the goal is to move colored plastic pieces from the start to your home base.  It's much like the game Trouble, except instead of rolling dice, you pick a card to determine the move.  You can also 'slide' by landing at the beginning of the slide -- which displaces any pieces on the slide pad.  It's always fun to send players back to the start!  Sorry is a fun, simple game.The classic version uses the old graphics and so forth from the original version.  The rules handout includes a number of variations, including a quick version that uses 3 instead of 4 pieces per player, partnership Sorry, and an advanced version for adults that involves scoring and keeping track of points.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9BJC1JM6YN6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B28IQ50#wasThisHelpful","R9BJC1JM6YN6K","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Puzzle Sort & Go is a clever accessory for puzzle fans of all types.  The kit includes stackable sorting trays to hold your puzzle pieces, which works for puzzles of up to 1000 pieces.  You can sort pieces by color, pattern, or type (e.g., edges) to assist in putting together your puzzle.  Before I had these trays, I used to end up with a bunch of unsightly piles of puzzle pieces that often got scattered and were difficult to sort through.Another major use of the trays is for easy cleanup.  Like most people, I don't have enough space in my home to have a table dedicated to puzzles, so I often need to put away a puzzle when I have company or when I do housecleaning.  The trays stack and fit into the box, allowing you to store a puzzle whenever you need to do so.  You can even transport your puzzle to another site via the box.  I also like using the trays to make sure that I don't accidentally push piles of puzzle pieces off the table and end up with a mess, which happens to me more often than I care to admit.

"California Fidelity Insurance, Kinsey's prior employer, has just paid out $500,000 on a death claim when the ""dead"" man (Wendell Jaffe) is spotted in Mexico.  Kinsey is hired to find him, but in the process she comes across some unexpected information about her past as well.  ""J Is for Judgement"" is a typical entry in the Alphabet series.  As usual, Kinsey is able to ingratiate herself into the lives of the people she's investigating, which includes Wendell's ex-wife, sons, former business partner, and girlfriend.  I love the series, but I do sometimes find it hard to believe how often Kinsey is taken in as a confidante, even when it might not be in the person's best interest.  She must be extremely empathetic and convincing.The mystery here is below average for the series.  There's a lack of a solid resolution, and Kinsey often does some rather stupid things (there were a dozen times when I thought that she should call the police).  What makes this book interesting are the developments in Kinsey's life.  These issues are contrasted by Grafton to the relationship between Kinsey's neighbor (Henry) and his annoying brother.  I love how Grafton is able to so subtly and naturally move the narrative of Kinsey's life slowly forward without ever interfering with the mystery in each book.  So despite the somewhat weak, slow-moving case, ""J Is for Judgement"" ended up being a fun read for me.Note: This review is for the Kindle version.

"I'm a huge fan of the Hard Case Crime series; unfortunately, ""Night Walker"" is the weakest of the dozen entries I've read so far.  The book starts off extremely well, with the protagonist, David Young, being picked up by a good samaritan.  Young is a sailor on his way to another stint in the service.  Of course, things quickly go horribly wrong, and Young finds himself in the hospital covered in bandages.  The plot up to that point is rather exciting, and the reader has no idea where it's all going.  However, it ends up going nowhere - very slowly.Author Donald Hamilton is best known for his spy books and the Matt Helm series, and he first published this book in 1954.  Although the book does start as a crime noir, it veers off toward an uncomfortable mix of spy novel and action without ever really finding its tone.  Hamilton tries to make Young more interesting by giving him PTSD (or its 1950s equivalent), but the character still ends up being fairly generic.  Even the book cover, which are usually fantastic in this series, is pretty boring.  For fans of Hard Case Crime, ""Night Walker"" is worth the read, especially considering how short it is (I read it in about six sittings, which is unusual for me); it's not bad but it doesn't live up to the quality of this fine series.Note: This review is for the Kindle version.

"I'm a big fan of Novak Djokovic, so I purchased ""Serve to Win"" to learn more about his life.  In that respect, the book is a bit of a let-down, given that it is not a traditional sports autobiography and focuses more on his recent diet changes and resulting tennis success.  Novak does share some stories about his life, including a few passages about growing up in war-torn Serbia.  At night, his family would hide in a bomb shelter, and in the day, he would practice tennis.  He's lead an extraordinary life, which is probably part of the reason that he is so popular in Serbia today.However, the book spends most of its time discuss his health issues over the years, particularly the various breathing and fitness concerns that plagued his early career.  These problems climaxed during a long five-set match at the Australian Open in 2010 against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.  Toward the end of that match, Djokovic crashed - he ran out of energy and lost the final two sets quickly.  He talks about how frustrating it was to train so much and still have so little gas left in the tank at the end of long matches.  The match happened to be watched by a Serbian nutritionist, who suggested that Novak be tested for allergies, especially gluten.  Fast forward a year, and Novak is experiencing an incredible winning streak - winning three majors and finishing 2012 as the #1 player.Djokovic's gluten-free diet is explained in detail.  I don't plan on using this diet, but I do appreciate the balanced tone he takes in discussing it.  He doesn't claim that it's for everyone or that it's a miracle diet.  He simply sets forth what it did for him and how he follows it.  Novak even cites research on its effectiveness, while maintaining that he's not a medical expert and so forth.  The book includes a section detailing what Novak eats during a typical day along with recipes; I like that he breaks it down into his four rules for eating, which could be simple for many people to follow.  If one wants to start a gluten-free diet, then this book could be a good initial guide.So how about the tennis fans?  Will they enjoy this book?  I did overall, even though I kept hoping for more behind-the-scenes information.  He mentions matches only in passing and mostly to illustrate his poor conditioning before his diet or his improved fitness after going gluten-free.  Not much dishing here, although he does note his anger when Andy Roddick famously questioned his health issues (Andy recently gave a more explicit version of the story whereby he and Novak almost came to blows in the locker room).  Ultimately, though, Novak has perhaps become too statesmen like, too sporting, to give us an insider's view of his life.  In the meantime, ""Serve to Win"" will do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKUB7O7SAUCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQZ65SI#wasThisHelpful","R1MKUB7O7SAUCA","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Girl with the Long Green Heart"" was originally published in 1965 and later reissued by Hard Case Crime in 2005.  The book tells of a long con attempt by John Hayden, a small-time con man who has just served a prison sentence.  He meets up with one of his former partners, Doug Rance, who has a proposition - one big con before John retires.  Although he's hesitant, John decides to go along as he has big dreams of buying a rundown bar outside Boulder, Colorado, and making a success of it.  The long con involves a Canadian land scheme and a New York businessman named Wallace Gunderman.  Of course, there's also a beautiful woman involved - Gunderman's secretary, Evie Stone - who is the titular girl with the long green heart.I enjoy stories of long cons and Block knows this genre so well.  The book is rife with realistic details, although these details may bore some readers.  The plot was a bit easy to figure out early on, but Block's writing always makes the trip fun, even if the destination is a bit predictable.  I particularly appreciate Block talent for descriptions.  Evie, for example, smells ""as clean and alive as a newly mown lawn.""  Later, John gets a meal in a cheap diner, where the ""food was greasy and so were most of the customers.""Note: This review is for the Kindle version, which was published by Open Road in 2010 rather than Hard Case Crime (I also have the paperback HCC version).

"Like most adults, I've played Yahtzee dozens of times since I was a child.  It's the kind of game that everyone knows, or else they can learn to play quickly.  This version is retro, as it recreates the design of the game from the 1950s (although it's funny to see a huge QR code plastered on the front of the box -- definitely not 1950s!).  The game consists of five components: five standard dice, a Yahtzee cup, a pack of scoring cards, eight bonus chips, and a direction booklet.  Whereas the standard Yahtzee cup is blue plastic, the classic version is cardboard wrapped in paper with a metal bottom.  When you shake the dice, it makes that classic Yahtzee sound (which I kind of like).My only quibble is that the game has so few pieces that they should put a bit more care into making the cup - it's made out of pretty much the same material as a Pringles container.  Also, they only include 20 scoring cards - they could be a bit more generous here.  Each card does have room for six games, but an average player will run out of cards fairly quickly and need to purchase a replacement set.Hasbro recommends the game for ages 8 years and up.  Playing can help a young child learn to count and add, so there is an educational element to the game.  However, it's still a fun game, even for children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H1KSGJ7JV4C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B28GVLG#wasThisHelpful","R3H1KSGJ7JV4C6","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Big Boss Electric Citrus Juicer is a solid, entry-level juicer.  I have been trying to add more fruits to my diet, and it's nice to have some freshly squeezed juice from time to time.  So this juicer suits my needs very well.  In particular, the juicer is easy to use and clean.  The top of the juicer has a ""cone"" where you place the citrus fruit -- it's pretty much like the hand-held juicers you can buy at the grocery store.  However, the ""cone"" rotates to extract the juice.  I appreciate the simple design.  I also love that I can use the bowl as a pitcher, so that saves one dirty dish.

"I get frustrated using hand-held pencil sharpeners, as it seems impossible to obtain a sharp point with them.  Not to mention getting hand cramps after trying to sharpen a few pencils in a row.  Whaaaaa.  So I'm loving my new Westcott iPoint Curve Axis Electric Pencil Sharpener (that's quite a mouthful!).The sharpener yields extra sharp pencil points.  Just what I wanted!  Yay!  Emptying the sharpener is a breeze - just remove the plastic holder on the bottom and slide it back onto the sharpener.  I like that it is clear plastic, so it's easy to see if it's getting full.  The best feature of the sharpener is that it's adjustable for different sized pencils; just rotate the dial on the top.  This feature allows the pencil to be inserted in such a manner to maximize the sharpness of the point.  I was able to sharpen three dozen colored pencils in just a few minutes.  They are extra sharp for all my drawing needs!  The sharpener is even sleek looking - everything I could want in an electric pencil sharpener.  I just wish I'd had this when I was still in school.

"If you're looking for inexpensive, basic white binders, then these may be perfect for you.  I like to use three-ring binders to store materials for my various work projects, and these binders work well for that purpose.  They're not fancy, although the front and back covers (as well as the spine) include a clear overlay that allows you to insert a standard piece of paper.  Thus, you can label or decorate your binders in any way you'd like.  The inside covers include vinyl pockets so that you can store un-punched paper or small materials.  The other feature I like is that the three-ring mechanism is not mounted on the inside spine but instead is offset to the right, which allows the notebooks to lay completely flat when open.  These notebooks would be particularly good for college or high school students (e.g., storing class notes or turning in projects).  The one drawback is that the folders are a bit flimsy looking, so I wouldn't use them for certain tasks (e.g., carrying to class every day).

I was a bit surprised to see them expanding into the ""small number of ingredients"" cookbook style.  However, I knew that if anyone would get it right, they would.  And indeed they did.  The feature I like the best is a short blurb before each recipe explaining ""Why this recipe works.""  These mini-tutorials can be applied to your everyday cooking skills.  For example, they explain that when frying eggs, you should cover the pan, which helps the eggs set.Each recipes cover the gamut from appetizers, soups, pastas, casseroles, and dessert.  They are perfect for simple yet tasty weekday meals.  Recipes do sometimes rely on processed or convenience foods, such as canned beans or V-8 juice, so many of these dishes would not be very good for people on low sodium diets.  Unfortunately, they do not offer any nutritional information for recipes.  However, even for people watching their diets, many of these recipes would be appropriate, as they contain just a few, fresh ingredients.  Full-color pictures of completed dishes are included for approximately 1/3 of the recipes.  In addition, color pictures accompany many of the ""Test Kitchen Tips"" that are scattered throughout the book (e.g., pitting olives, washing leeks, making a foil packet).  As with their other cookbooks, ""6-Ingredient Solution"" is packed with great ideas for the home cook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PQWC02Q4VESI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936493446#wasThisHelpful","R1PQWC02Q4VESI","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a well-researched and informative look at an important topic: child anxiety disorders.  Children often experience anxiety, and parents are sometimes confused about how to react.  In particular, they may over-react by being protective, or they may fail to see the severity of the problem.  Thus, I was pleased to see that this book includes detailed information about treatment as well as helpful pointers for involving caregivers.  After all, children with anxiety often have anxious parents.The sections on family accommodation and boundaries are particularly useful.  As a mental health professional, I've seen time and time again the lengths to which families will try to accommodate their child's anxiety, which can lead to secondary problems.  The parents of children with anxiety often fear that they caused the problem, so this section can help them to see that, although they did not cause it, they need to be part of the solution.  I could definitely imagine having parents read this section to help them understand the situation better and their role.The treatment outlined in this book is based on solid, empirically-based interventions for child anxiety - mostly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and related approaches.  References are included throughout, documenting the efficacy of the treatment.  Of course, there are many books that describe CBT for child anxiety; what sets this one apart is the focus on caregivers.  For example, the authors sensitively address the role that parent anxiety may play in the treatment, which I found particularly useful.  Brief case studies are sprinkled throughout the text, allowing the reader to see how the treatments work.I should note that, although this book is subtitled ""A guide for caregivers,"" it is written for mental health professionals working with caregivers of anxious children.  I think that this book may not be easily digested by parents without any background in psychology or mental health.  For example, the section on 'emotion regulation' begins with this sentence: Self-regulation describes the system by which an individual returns to a state of equilibrium after an event has caused a disruption in some element of functioning.  I would not give this book to parents and expect them to be able to read it easily and make the suggested changes; however, I would use it to guide the treatment I do with families.  Maybe assigning sections for 'bibliotherapy' may be possible with some parents.  Indeed, it contains many useful analogies that I will be using in the future with parents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DH0NOBSDWS86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118121015#wasThisHelpful","R1DH0NOBSDWS86","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harry Healy is a small-time crook who has just made bail.  He's broke, so he reluctantly agrees to be a drug courier for a Miami Beach Dutch businessman (the titular uncle).  Things immediately go wrong, of course, and he finds himself being framed for a crime.  The book details his efforts to elude police, the goings-on of various low-life criminals who framed him, and the police working on the case.Peter Pavia's ""Dutch Uncle"" is entry #12 in the Hard Case Crime series; it was written expressly for the series (as opposed to the re-releases from genre masters that the series also includes) and published in 2005.  It's the tenth I have read, and so far, I'd have to say that it's the weakest.  The major problem is that it's an overly busy book, with a multitude of characters who come and go and really don't add much to the story.  The main character is particularly vague and bland, which is a shame given how important a strong central character is to this sort of crime book.  The writing is ok, but not as colorful as I expect from the series.  The Hard Case Crime books are always fun to read, and I did find this one somewhat enjoyable; however, there simply are far better entries in the series.Note: This review is for the Kindle version.  The transfer to e-book has been done with care, and I found no obvious errors.

"I use my Westcott Paper Trimmer mostly for cutting down sheets of paper for use in my day planner.  This type of job doesn't require that the paper be completely even, so this trimmer is perfect for my needs.  The scoring feature is nice and allows you to check before making a cut, and the titanium cutting blade is sharp enough for most household needs.  I tried cutting a manila folder in half, and it worked fine.  I also like the swing out ruler, which allows one to measure paper before cutting.I do have two problems with the trimmer.  First, the metal plates on the cutting surface and ruler have obviously been glued to the plastic base, and the glue is visible around the edges.  It makes the trimmer look cheap and somewhat dirty looking (I keep thinking that it needs to be cleaned).  Second, and more importantly, the trimming blade is on the outside edge of the trimmer handle, leaving it exposed when lifting the paper holder.  I already almost cut myself (my finger came into contact with the blade).  I have another Westcott cutter, and the blade is in the middle of the trimmer handle, so it is not exposed unless you put your finger in the gap in the paper holder.  Overall, though, for the price, I think this trimmer is a good product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4BK69OXQP1DJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GP5L3U#wasThisHelpful","R4BK69OXQP1DJ","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sampler pack of Numi Organic Savory Tea includes 6 different flavors: tomato mint, spinach chive, fennel spice, carrot curry, broccoli cilantro, and beet cabbage.  Having six different flavors was fantastic, and I enjoyed sampling them.  Some of them are quite tasty, and given their savory nature, they do taste a bit like vegetable broth.  I found them a pleasant change from regular tea, to which I normally add some sweetener.  They also smell quite nice.  I did find, though, that they need to be piping hot.  As they cool, the teas tend to become quite bland, and I needed to reheat them because they tasted odd when cold.  These are great for mid-day pick-me-ups or late at night when you feel a bit hungry and need something to tide you over until bedtime.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6S230CVR2CN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9AAI9S#wasThisHelpful","R3H6S230CVR2CN","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love glazed carrots, or I should say that I like the 'idea' of glazed carrots.  Too often, they're like Pictsweet Glazed Medallions - sickly sweet and mushy with no hint of that buttery taste that makes glazed carrots so delicious.  These carrots really aren't glazed. ""Glazing"" implies that they have been sauteed and browned in butter and brown sugar.  These carrots are just (overly) cooked carrots in a super sweet brown sugar sauce.  Maybe I'm expecting a bit much from frozen carrots, and as a singleton, I do appreciate the single serving size (which is actually two servings).  However, the off-putting taste of the glaze prevents me from buying these carrots again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXYBP3SK0A08C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B03XWAG#wasThisHelpful","RXYBP3SK0A08C","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember these kinds of multi-colored pens from when I was a kid in the 1980s.  I was excited back then to get a Big 4-colored pen, but I recall that it broke pretty quickly.  Perhaps this kind of pen never went away, but I was surprised to see that they seemingly have become quite popular again, especially with people using Filofaxes.  I hesitated to buy one until I saw that Paper Mate now makes an InkJoy version.  I've had some issues with other InkJoy pens - several of mine have leaked or had blobs of ink collect at the tip.  However, given that InkJoy is one of Paper Mates higher end pens, I hoped that the new Quatro would have solved some of these issues.  So far, so good - no leaking or ink blobs.The pen is fairly attractive, with a wide white barrel and a hard rubber gray grip; I do wish that the grip was a bit more comfortable, but then I don't plan on using this pen for large writing jobs.  The pen seems sturdier than the ones I had back in the 1980s, although the click mechanism feels somewhat flimsy.  The inks are the typical Paper Mate shades of black, dark blue, red, and green.  I like Paper Mate because their ink tends to be dark, and the pens write smoothly.  I edit and grade many papers, so I enjoy having the different colored inks in the same pen and being able to change easily.  It's a fun pen that could be useful to many writers and doodlers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CBO1W59SNAXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ8UDNE#wasThisHelpful","R3CBO1W59SNAXM","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Russell+Hazel pockets are designed for the mini binders - I use the kind that are designed to hold 5 1/2 x 8 1/2 inch paper.  I love to use the smaller binders because they are so easy to handle and store, so I organize my various work and home projects in a series of them.  Because I use so many of them, I'm always looking for new inserts to use in them, and these attractive pockets are a nice addition to my collection.  Each pocket is 6 5/8 x 8 3/8 inches, so they are a bit wider than most accessories I use in mini binders.  Because they are wider, they can also be used as dividers.  Each of the pockets has a different colored stripe on the edge, so they actually work quite well as dividers.  I also appreciate that they have pockets on both sides, which I think all pockets should.I have a few minor issues with these pockets. First, I was surprised that even though the pockets are made of paper (nice card stock), they are not reinforced at the holes.  Second, the pockets are rather shallow - a bit over 3 1/2nches deep - so I hesitate to put taller items into them.  Third, they are very pricey for paper pockets.  I'm glad I purchased Russell+Hazel Mini Paper Pockets as they look great in my mini binders, but at this cost, I wouldn't buy more of them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SFKVHBBH2B5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AS1HHQ#wasThisHelpful","R1SFKVHBBH2B5L","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Promised Land"" stars Matt Damon and Frances McDormand as employees of an energy company; the two work as a team going into small farming communities and buying land in order to drill for natural gas - or fracking.  Damon plays Steve Butler.  He's good at his job because he grew up in a similar small town and can relate to the people he meets.  As the film starts, Steve has just been promoted, and he's sent to another (unnamed) community in rural Pennsylvania expecting to wrap up sales in a few days.  However, he's underestimated this particular hamlet, and he finds himself battling the townspeople, an environmentalist (John Krasinski), and ultimately himself.The movie has a terrific pedigree - an Oscar-nominated director (Gus Van Sant), a story by an acclaimed hipster writer (Dave Eggers), and an Oscar-winning co-author (Damon writing along with Krasinski). Plus, the always amazing McDormand is along for the ride.  And the movie almost lives up to all of that, although it fell just short for me, with an ending that didn't match the movie's overall tone.  Nevertheless, there's much to like about ""Promised Land.""  Damon and McDormand make a fantastic and fully believable team, who find themselves in realistic yet funny situations as they try to woo the town.  The depictions of life in a rural area and the local people are pretty much spot on also.  Too often Hollywood movies populate small towns with the type of quirky, eccentric townspeople better suited for episodes of ""Green Acres.""Some audiences are going to take issue with ""Promised Land"" due to its somewhat dewy liberal politics, although I suspect that environmentalists may argue that it doesn't go far enough.  Therein lies it's charm for me - the movie does have an agenda, but it's unspooled in a (mostly) subtle manner, with compassionate and likeable characters on both sides of the green divide.  I found myself entertained more often than lectured to, which is the effect that a good 'issues' movie should have on its audience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRT8TMD2MQM1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHI5OG8#wasThisHelpful","RRT8TMD2MQM1P","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bird flash card set is absolutely adorable! It's made in Japan by Midori, the renowned paper company, and is part of their line of animal mini flash card sets. The cards are white and cut into bird shapes. The set is very small (about 2 inches long and a bit more than one inch tall at its highest point) - the picture with a penny next to it is accurate.If you plan on using the bird flash cards as an educational tool, then you need to write small or be brief due to the limited space. The odd shape of the cards also presents a challenge. The paper is quite thin. The pack contains 81 cards; when I received it, I estimated by the size of the bird that it was only 30 pages, but it does actually have 81. (Why 81? Maybe to allow multiplication tables up to 9?) This thinness makes it somewhat hard to turn the pages. In addition, when I wrote on it, although my ink didn't bleed through, it did often show through to the other side of the card. So I wouldn't recommend using the flashcard with information on both sides unless you write very lightly.However, as one would expect from Midori the paper is high quality; they really specialize in excellent thin paper. The cards are somewhat slick and glossy, making them seem fairly durable if used carefully - the pages don't rip off of the key ring very easily. Despite being glossy, the paper actually takes ink quite well, and I have been able to write on the cards easily with a variety of pens (rollerball, fountain, ballpoint, felt-tip).I really love this flash card set, and I have purchased several others in the animal line. I think these flash cards may be useful for teenagers or college students, but because of their size and thinness, I would not recommend them for younger children. I personally bought them for decorative purposes (the turtle is the most adorable) just because they're so unbelievably cute.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MOX4TF06ZV4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Z90BHG#wasThisHelpful","R2MOX4TF06ZV4H","A4UKBG3M5U5TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4UKBG3M5U5TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This package comes with three separate small holders for the Midori Traveler's Notebook system.  One holder is rectangular and the size of a typical business or credit card, and the other two holders are slightly smaller (roughly 2 3/4 inches wide and 2 inches tall).  One is intended to go on the inside cover, as it opens on the right, and the other is intended to go on the back cover, as it opens on the left.  These holders are the perfect size for holding stamps or small stickers.  The pouches stick extremely well onto either the paper covers of Midori notebook refills or to the leather cover itself.  They fit into either the regular size or the Passport size Midoris (I have the Passport size).  It's difficult, though, putting one on the inside of the back cover for the Passport size, as the elastic band is tied in the middle of the leather cover.  Although these are designed for the Midori, they could be used for any small notebooks, icluding Moleskine, Field Notes, and Rhodia.

"""Vocal"" is the second song released in advance of Pet Shop Boy's new dance CD, ""Electric,"" and it's another winner.  The song is all about being in a club and becoming one with the music - being carried away by the thumping bass, writhing dancers, and the feeling of euphoria.  They really captured the feeling perfectly, and it's one of the best dance songs PSB have released in many years.  Neil's vocals are muted, almost robotic, which adds a melancholy feel to the proceedings.  The lyrics also convey the yearning to feel part of something:  I like the people/ I like the song/ I like the singer/ He's lonely and strange.  This kind of song is what PSB do best - a real club thumper with reflective lyrics that can appeal to outsiders or just make you want to dance.The song was produced by Stuart Price (Madonna, The Killers), and he brings a current club sound to it; indeed, several top dance radio shows played ""Vocal"" within its first week of release.  I've been a huge PSB fan for years, and I'm constantly amazed by the high quality of their releases.  However, even I never expected that they'd be making such extraordinary music 30 years after ""West End Girls.""  Bravo to PSB!Note: This review is for the 6:34 album version of ""Vocal.""

"These flashlights are very handy to have around the house.  The four pack makes it convenient to stash them in the car or around the house.

I suggest alkaline batteries because they seem to last longer.  Each unit holds three AAA batteries.Overall, I was pleased with these flashlights and I know they'll get some use.

"This is the second Victor J. Stenger book I have read and I must say it's the best of the two. Stenger tackles every aspect of religion and how it relates to science.  He pulls no punches nor does he make apologies for what he says.  He is truly a New Atheist along with the likes of Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens and Sam HarrisThe folly of faith is that it has no support in science or reality.  Faith depends upon a person's beliefs and an intuition that they are true.  The author says that, ""Science flies  us to the moon, religion flies us into buildings"".Stenger uses a lot of science in his persuations about religion and God.  Though briefly touching on Evolution, he says most Christians don't believe Evolution is true, but instead think God has guided us on the evolutionary path, which is not what Evolution is all about.Of all the New Atheists, Stenger is the only one who is a physicist.  I found his chapter on Quantum Tunneling extremely interesting.  It is the only book that really explains the theory and it backs my own thoughts on the matter.This book also deals with  Near Death Experiences, or NDEs,  and Reincarnation.  His take on these experiences is that there is insufficient evidence either way to support belief or non-belief and that probably more research needs be done in this area.  He also delves into faith healings and Eastern Mysticism.Overall, this is an important book for anyone who is looking for answers on the issues of God, religion and how they relate to science.  The author is definitely writing from  an atheist's point of view and he uses his scientific education and training to support his views.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37Y5MNBKWOI5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616145994#wasThisHelpful","R37Y5MNBKWOI5M","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good stuff.  I used this silicone sealant to glue in the glass panels on my grandfather clock I had built.  It was definitely hard to squeeze out of the tube but seems to be bonding well enough to the wood and glass panels.I read that other reviewers had had trouble with the sealant coming out of the other end of the tube.  I squeezed carefully at first, then rolled the end of the tube up when it was partially empty.  This worked and also made the tube easier to manage.Another problem is the tube is primarily a one time use in that it dries at the end of the applicator making it useless after the first use.  I suppose you could clean it with a big nail, but I didn't.  There's not really very much sealant in this tube so I guess you won't be wasting very much of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GNJ3MUPG5L88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002BBX3U#wasThisHelpful","R3GNJ3MUPG5L88","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had previously purchased the Rockwell Versacut circular saw but it had its drawbacks.  I needed to cut some interior grooves  for retaining the glass panels in the grandfather clock I was buildings.  The Versacut's plunge insertion would not easily give me the right depth, so I bought the TK3441K circular saw.  It worked great, making easy and smooth cuts exactly where I wanted them.  The narrow kerf was appreciated.The one thing I did not like about this saw is the grip.  It's uncomfortable to grip and makes controlling the path of the blade more difficult.  I am left handed so using that hand, it's hard to see where the blade is going because it's positioned on the left side of the machine.  This might not be the case for right handed individuals, however, I did not have these problems with any of my Skill saws.Being small and compact, this saw will fit into tighter places than a full size saw.  Unlike the Versacut, this saw will cut all the way through a 2X4 on one pass.  The blade is more delicate than the Skill saw blades, so hitting a nail would be disastrous  for it.  Due to its small, rather delicate blade, this saw is better suited for hobbies or cabinetry work.  I would not want to build a garage with it.Overall it's a handy tool to have that has unique uses.  I just wish it had a better grip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFL3N1SBZB45M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTEU0M4#wasThisHelpful","RFL3N1SBZB45M","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I guess we all know the story of how Columbus discovered America, however, there have been very few films depicting the journey or the man himself, who to most of us is a mystery.There have been dozens of movies made about the Civil War, the Revolutionary War and other facets of American history, but none about its  actual discovery.  The land, of course, was known to the Vikings and perhaps the Chinese and other groups prior to 1492 but was still unknown to most of Europe.In thin 1992 film, the 500 anniversary of the voyage, Gerard Depardieu portrays the 39 year old Christopher Columbus.  The story of how a common ordinary man has the ambition and the opportunity to discover new lands rumored to exist to the west of the Atlantic ocean.Although Columbus made three actual voyages to the Americas, only the first two are detailed in the film.An interesting side note is the Inquisition is depicted in frightening detail as some of the supposed heretics are burned at the stake in the public square for all to see.I enjoyed the movie but felt it was a bit lengthy and dragged out.  Sigourney  Weaver's portrayal of queen Isabella was a bright spot in the film.  And I'm not sure that Columbus' seemingly benevolent  treatment of the native Americans is historically accurate.  Otherwise, it's a great and interesting film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I8GKJGONYH5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A2VMV4#wasThisHelpful","R2I8GKJGONYH5P","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a rather beautiful coffee table book containing many very interesting and informative maps.  There are many maps I have not seen before.  One of the more interesting maps is the 1744 Great Lakes map by the Jesuit  explorer, Jacques Bellin.  It is especially interesting to me, being from this area,  by the fact there are no cities or towns, just rivers, lakes and Indian lands.  Big changes in just a short amount of time.There are many other interesting maps, for instance, the 1585 map of Virginia by John White.  The colonies at Roanoke predates the Puritans arrival at Plymouth Rock by decades.There is also plenty of text explaining details of the maps, but mainly the maps speak for themselves.  I enjoyed perusing its pages.  The author attempts an intellectual approach to exploring.  And how the explorers and their patrons understood their expanding world and their place in  it.

"This is a beautiful  10 X 12 coffee table book.  It is a DK book which are noted for their stunning photographs.  Although the book has a dust jacket, the cover of the book is identical to the jacket and not a plain color as is the case with many other books in this class.The maps themselves are both informative and beautiful.  Many of them were created for nobility, the clergy and the wealthy upper class rather than for seamen or merchant travelers who would put them to good and practical use.  Thus, many of them are more art than science.The maps begin with classical period maps from the forth century to the seventh century BCE.  They saw the world, or parts of it, quite differently than we see it today.  The Ptolemy world map is one such.  Some, like the Babylonian World map are made of clay and are difficult  to decipher.Maps from many countries of origin in both the Western and Eastern worlds have been included.  I especially liked the Mercator world map of 1569.  I would like to have a full size copy of it for my wall.  The original is four feet by almost seven feet in length.  In America, nothing west of the Great Lakes is noted.In addition to maps of the land masses there are maps of the sea floor and even a map of the lunar surface.This is a marvelous book that one can spend hours looking over.  There is some explanatory text but mostly the maps speak for themselves.  Since man first learned how to make graphic marks on rock 40,000 years ago, humans have created maps as a way of conceptualizing themselves in relation to their enviornment.  So maps are as much about our existence as they are about the orientation of lands.Anyone who loves and enjoys maps would be enthralled  with this beautiful volume of 256 pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R203JM03PVV0KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465424636#wasThisHelpful","R203JM03PVV0KZ","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent book about atheism.  The author, a professor of philosophy at California State University-Sacramento specializes in atheism.His logic is impeccable.  He addresses the reasons why we believe in Jesus and God and then shatters them like broken glass on the floor.The reason why most Christians believe comes from the pages of the Judeo-Christian Bible.  It is a collection of stories and verse assembled by the early Christians in the first centuries after Christ.  Before the Bible or any of its books were written down, stories  were passed along by word of mouth for decades.  Human tendencies exaggerated , changed, embellished and added to these stories before they were ever written down.  Add to that, the gospels we have are not the originals.  They are copies of copies of copies of the originals  that have been changed since being first written.  And of the many gospels or books written about Christ, only a few were actually chosen to be canonized into the Bible.  Even after that there were changes made until the final result was a book quite unlike the original story.If there had been any information contrary to the view that Jesus was God, it would have long ago been scrubbed from Christian doctrine and the Bible.  The Bible that we now know today has been coalesced over the centuries through a process that deliberately tried to minimize contradictions that did not fit with core Christian doctrines.McCormick states that Iron Age people of the Bible would have seen the world full of mysterious forces, magical events and spiritual  entities; stories about supernatural happenings would have been common for them.  The possibility that someone who could come back from the dead  would have seemed like common sense to them.  Basically, they were an uneducated, illiterate lot who believed in magic and the supernatural.Paul's first Christians were the Romans.  The Romans believed in a whole pantheon of gods.  They were expected to believe in all of them.  To accept one more, the Christian God was no big deal.  They just added him on.  The Romans thought that these gods controlled the weather and natural forces on the Earth.  To disrespect a god, any god, would invoke their wrath.McCormick says, what if there was never an empty tomb at all?  What if Jesus was buried and remained there in the tomb for two thousand years?  (McCormick does not mention it in the book but the Talpiot tomb discovered in 1990 in Israel is thought to be the Jesus family tomb ).Next, the author tackles miracles.  He says that if God has the goal to proving his existence through miracles, he would need to make them evident to a great many well educated skeptical people who do not already believe, instead of the superstitious illiterate followers who already do believe.  To those people from the Iron Age, a toaster or a flush toilet  would have seemed a ""miracle"".The author says religious people often use circular reasoning to support their faith.Believer:  I believe that God is real.Critic:  But why would you believe this?Believer:  Because the Bible says he is.Critic:  Why believe what the Bible says?Believer:  Because God wrote it.An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the Golden Calf.  But the believer says that those gods aren't real, that only his god is real although he doesn't have a single shred of proof to back up his supposition.McCormick says that faith in one religion is as good as faith in another.  It has to be because faith is believing despite the evidence.  The believer can't have it both ways.  A number of studies have shown that people will go on believing something even after their reasons have been shown to be faulty.And finally the author says that some believers aren't actually believers. they are faking it due to social pressures.  They go to church, sing the songs and hymns and say the prayers, yet don't believe in a single word of it.  This even goes for some of the preachers.  In Dennetts study, many in the clergy no longer believe.  They, after really reading the Bible cannot rationalize it as being true, yet they still need work so they play act or pretend to their congregations.  And there are probably many more to whom the study has not reached.  Bart Erhman, who provided much of the information in this book, is one such biblical scholar.I enjoyed reading this book.  There is plenty here for the theist to think about and some interesting ideas for the atheist as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q8TRMIF8PBUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616145811#wasThisHelpful","R1Q8TRMIF8PBUD","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a shorter version of the hard cover edition of What Great Paintings Say.  It contains only 200 pages, as opposed to 500 pages of the later.It begins not with a painting, but a tapestry or embroidered cloth dating to 1066 when the Normans invaded England.  The artisan is unknown.  It depicts  battle scenes of the Norman king, William the Conqueror's victory over king Harold at the battle of Hastings.  The tapestry is over 70 meters long.The rest of the book contains mostly European paintings by the masters thru 1938.  Many of the artists were unknown to me as were their works.The text gives an explanation of both artist and the work presented, giving details of the artists life and what is known about the paintings and of the era in which they were created.Several insets of each painting are enlarged so that the viewer can observe particular details of the works.Not all of the most famous masters are represented in this volume.  For instance, Leonardo da Vinci has been completely omitted.While this is a fine volume of art, I would pass on it and buy the much longer expanded hard cover edition of the book.  Many, though not all, of the works are included in the expanded edition.One very irritating thing about this book is that the works are spread across the spine of the book, thereby making part of the paintings hidden within it and difficult to see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVQ5D3KGZPP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EWLMDW#wasThisHelpful","R3DVQ5D3KGZPP0","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Coconut oil has amazing properties I'm just finding out about.  Not only is coconut oil a healthy food, it also has many health benefits as well.  If taken on a regular basis, the oil has been found to:1. Promote weight loss.2. Help protect against heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and many other degenerative diseases.3. Prevent premature aging of the skin.4. Strengthen the immune system.5. Improve digestion.One of the things coconut oil does is promote good oral health.  In primitive societies where modern fast foods are not yet available, the natives have very healthy dentition, few cavities and no gingivitis even though they do not brush  or floss their teeth.

He was quite an amazing person, not so much in his waking condition, but while in a self induced trance state during which he was able to cure many people of difficult conditions.  Many wealthy and important men sought his advice.  His sessions were free and he never charged money.Apparently, everyone has the ability to see an aura but some of us are more gifted and seeing them comes naturally.This book, however, was written by himself and explains auras or the colors surrounding both human and animal bodies.  The colors he explains can detect both the condition of the body and the type of person he or she is.  This was the last thing he wrote and it encompasses a lifetime of experience  seeing and interpreting auras.The book is very brief, and is more of a pamphlet, containing barely 20 pages.

"In this brief book, the author Richard Carrier gives us his reasons why he is not a Christian and does not believe in God.He says, ""If God wants something from me, he would tell me.""  But God does doesn't say or do anything.  And if God wants man to know something, he would tell everyone; Christians, Muslims, Hindus, everyone and make it perfectly clear in their own languages, but he doesn't.  He says, ""the fact that God does nothing is a decisive refutation of the Christian hypothesis.""Carrier says ""Christianity quite clearly makes extraordinary claims that there is a disembodied, universally present being with magical powers; that this superbeing actually conjured the present universe from nothing; that we have souls that survive the death of our bodies (or that our bodies will be rebuilt in the distant future by this invisible superbeing); and that this being possessed the body of Jesus two thousand years ago, who then preformed many supernatural deeds before miraculously rising from the grave to chat with his friends, and then flew up into outer space.""  ""Not a single one of these claims has any general proven proposition to support it.""Carrier says that those who claim to have ""seen"" of ""spoken"" to God are either lying, insane or are only imagining what they saw or heard.  He says even believers admit this because they must in order to explain all the non-Christian visions and divine communications from other cultures.Carrier says that the nature of the universe is not as the early first Christians tried to explain it.  In other words, a geocentric universe with seven planets governed by God's law.  It is instead a universe best explained by the atheist's version of reality in which the Earth and mankind play a small, almost insignificant part.This is a short, easily to read and understand book which gives the many reasons for the falseness of the Christian (and other) faiths.  It will of course not appeal to the faithful, but his reasoning is clear and flawless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYMUMP2K3UH1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1456588850#wasThisHelpful","RYMUMP2K3UH1H","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The New Arthritis Cure provides a seven step plan to reduce or eliminate the pain and swelling of arthritis.  The steps are as follows:Step 1. Oral health.Step 2. Fight systemic infection.Step 3. Anti-arthritis diet.Step 4. Joint rejuvenation.Step 5. Exercise.Step 6. Weight management.Step 7. Calm inflammation.Each of these steps is thoroughly discussed, explaining how to achieve your goal in reducing pain and inflammation.  Also discussed is the arthritis forming diet wherein certain foods actually cause inflammation and pain.  Foods like processed meats, frozen dinners and alcohol, the typical American diet (SAD) cause inflammation and are to be avoided.The main ingredient in Dr. Fife's program is coconut oil.  Coconut oil kills many of the organisms that cause joint paint.  For some people, the author states, that just taking 3 or 4 tablespoons of the oil completely rids them of joint pain.  He encourages us to use a technique called ""pulling"".  Pulling, or swishing the oil in the mouth for 15-20 minutes a day, rids the mouth and teeth of bacteria and infection thought to be a source for the  arthritis pain.The book is an interesting and easy read.  It can be read in about an hour's time.  There is, however, much information about good health and there is every reason to believe that following the instructions and advice  contained in the book, will lead to a significant reduction or elimination of arthritis pain.Coconut oil is safe, easy to use, does not spoil, does not interfere with other medications and is economical to take.  Why not give it a try.  There's absolutely nothing to lose.I did not see any bad information in the book.  Much of what the author says was already known to me.  As I had already been doing some of the recommendations with some success.  (At age 73, I ran a 5K road race with no knee pain during the race) But I would like to get rid of all the inflammation and pain in my body, so I will begin to use the coconut oil and see if it improves my condition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PP3WWXV57X3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0941599825#wasThisHelpful","R3PP3WWXV57X3X","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is really a wonderful set of acrylic colors.  It reminds me of the giant box of Crayolas I had as a kid.  The tube size is generous and even though this is a student set, the colors are quite good.The big box contains four trays of paints with 12 colors in each tray.  The tubes are plastic which means the color will easily squish out if you're not careful.  The tubes are NOT sealed with a tin seal, just the plastic cap which might allow some of the lesser used colors to dry out if not used regularly.This is a good set for experimentation with various hues without mixing them yourself.  And included are colors which can't be mixed (like unbleached titanium) with a basic set.Some painting books I have read call for buying the best paint you can afford. But I think the quality is good enough for most, if not all, beginners and at  less than a dollar a tube for all of them, it's really a bargain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZWXJ4ZSR278/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00251I66C#wasThisHelpful","RSZWXJ4ZSR278","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Art of Portrait Drawing by Joy Thomas is an excellent book for aspiring artists interested in improving their skills.  The author has been a professional artist for 20 years and who works from a home studio with her husband doing commissioned work for various clients. She states she cannot possibly teach anyone everything they need to know on the subject and recommends they attend classes and lectures to further improve their skills.The author presents various studies done by her that represent the methods used by the old masters.  Included are the canons and divine proportion.  She further uses sketches illustrating the effects of various angles of lighting.Not only does the artist work in pencil, she also uses charcoal and conte crayons giving the work an illusion of color.  She prefers to work from life rather than photographs, as this can reveal the mood of the subject better.  But if photographs are to be used, she prefers taking them herself.This book will be better utilized by more advanced rather than beginning artists, as the more basic skills of drawing and anatomy are not covered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ORRTR6OBFPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1440320101#wasThisHelpful","R14ORRTR6OBFPO","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find Monet's paintings, along with those of Renoir, to be the most appealing of all the Impressionists.  His use of color and subject matter are truly awesome.So I bought this book to try to emulate some of his work (they say that imitation is the sincerest  form of flattery).  Because I liked the composition and theme, I chose to do the Bridge at Argenteuil.  I did not use the tracing paper, but instead did my composition freehand with 8B pencil.  I skipped a few steps but tried to duplicate the master's brushstrokes.  Overall, the painting came out good and I framed it.  My clouds came out especially good.The book itself gives a brief description of Monet, how he worked and lived his life.  Then the author lists the tools, paints  and brushes needed to complete each work.  Five individual paintings are used.  This book is probably not for absolute beginners, as many basic techniques are not explained.Monet worked primarily in oil and this book suggests working in acrylic which presents its own problems.  Acrylic paint is beautiful to work with, but it dries very fast so must be done rather quickly.  It also dries darker. Still, there is absolutely no reason why an artist duplicating Monet's work cannot use oil paints for the job.  I chose to use the acrylic paints.Overall, this is a nice, but rather brief book that gives us a look over the shoulder of the master's work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G0V7B67FX1VL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1844484556#wasThisHelpful","R3G0V7B67FX1VL","A23VTC6VKNFZVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VTC6VKNFZVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Product is too expensive for vegans to take needed amounts. All the algal DHA and EPA supplements cost about $100 a month to meet the levels suggested by health studies to keep good brain function and prevent depression. We need 1200 mg EPA and 800mg DHA daily! The amounts the vegan supplements recommend for daily dose are too low to be realistic. (Read Fighting Depression and Improving Cognition with Omega-3 Fatty Acids) I need about 3 bottles a month of this brand, 5 bottles a month of other vegan Omegas. We need to do something about this so vegans can stay healthy and pay a reasonable price for making non-violent dietary choices. I want companies to earn fair profits, but this is never going to work best for most people.

"The cut of these reminds me of the original Levi's corduroy jeans from when they only made men's styles, but women wore them too. The fabric is a very narrow corduroy and looks almost like a velvet or cotton suede. I love the colors! I bought the Black Orchid, Green Pine and Dark Choco, they are all very subtle and attractive shades. These are true 5 pocket style, including the slot-pocket over the right front pocket, for something small. There is a lovely detail in the style of double belt loops, so they may be worn with an 1""- 1.5"" belt or with a skinny, quarter-inch style belt, this is not bulky or noticeable, it just adds a great, unique feature to these corduroy jeans.The fabric says 98% cotton, 2% elastic, but they are really stretchy. The waist and tops of the back pockets give  2 to 3 inches when I stick a fist in the waistband or pocket. I was a bit worried they might stretch out too much during a day's wear and the back pockets might be too loose for a wallet, but so far they do't become out-of-shape. The stretchy fabric is quite comfortable for sitting, bending and moving about. The fabric feels like cotton corduroy to the touch; it is only when stretching them the elastic ""give"" can be felt in it's effect. There is no slippery, synthetic feel, I'm surprised to say it might be better than 100% cotton because the ""give"" makes it so comfortable!.The fit on me (5'6"", 137 lbs) is just a bit large in size 12 (they can be pulled down and off without un-buttoning or un-zipping, I wouldn't wear these without a belt), but 10 seems slightly tight in the seat and waistband. The length is long on me, by about 3 inches (I never wear heels, as the pictures show, with this type of pants). After washing in warm and drying completely on high heat, there was no shrinking. The rise is low, but not super low (safe to bend forward with no exposure); they sit above the hips but not up near the natural waist.I'd say these will be most ideal for women 5""9 to 5'11. The inseams on all sizes seems to be 33"" (I tried sizes 8, 10 and 12, and measured each of them); women under 5""9"", who don't wear heels with jeans, will need to hem these. I bought the odd colors and sizes for under $27.00. Check the different sizes and colors for the deals. I don't think I would pay more than $40 for these, so they loose one star for a high price point with some of them going for $69.. Good luck!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM5PYACNNORKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIAUJH2#wasThisHelpful","RM5PYACNNORKG","A37Z843SR49K8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37Z843SR49K8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well sewn. Leg cuffs at bottoms are very wide, only useful with giant boots on. Snow will come up the cuffs! There are no belt loops and the waist cinching elastic is an odd design. It can be fitted to the waist only with an awkward velcro tabbed elastic at the back of the waist. It will likely be hard to keep these from slipping down at the waist because of the bad cinching design. Pockets are not at side seams but straight over each thigh in front, not suitable for keeping hands warm, but flat and with zips for keeping ID or small objects. Waterproof outer fabric is a bit shinny and cheap looking, but these will do in a pinch.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLA9H3CQ2BPLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H81DXS#wasThisHelpful","RLA9H3CQ2BPLU","A37Z843SR49K8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37Z843SR49K8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cut of this is odd. It is  narrow at the bust, tight on my 36 B frame, it will be very tight on larger busted women, unless worn without zipping-up past the waist. Moreover, it a has strange, unflattering pattern, with the arm holes cutting in at the front causing a backwards ""racerback"" sort of t shape to the front. The top seamof the shoulders comes foward again to the front and the overall length is long. It fits like a long, narrow ""wife-beater"" t shirt on backwards! It is designed to fit a figure I can't understand, long and narrow like a pole. The sewing is good, no skips or snags. The black on I bought has no logo or non-matching trim like another reviewer wrote about, mine is all black.It is warm but so strangely fitted that I would never buy it again and probably will give it to charity.

"This tea has a strong flavor. It can be slightly bitter but some will not mind, or it may be brewed fpr shorter time for a lighter flavor. Another method is to add sugar for a rich, sweet tea.

"This developed some sort of loose connection or short at the mini usb connection aperture or between the phone and the charge ""puck"". It works, but erratically rather than reliably. Exactly as several other reviewers report, when the phone is placed on the charger, it turns on and off over and over again. Instead of a steady charge, messages display showing it continuously flipping between ""charging"" and ""not charging"". (There is no extra case on my phone and it is a correct model for this charger).Carefully placing the phone on the puck seems to make little difference. Trying many possible positions and placements of the phone on the puck sometimes results with a steady charging, but it works very inconsistently. It is difficult to tell which position might work or why it only sometimes gives a steady charge. This defeats the point of an easy to use place-and-go charger because it must be fiddled with to prevent the rapid winking off and on glitch. Worth the money only if you like to gamble or enjoy a weird challenge.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12K1HT8W5Y9R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQDE1K8#wasThisHelpful","R12K1HT8W5Y9R1","A37Z843SR49K8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37Z843SR49K8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sadly this style does not fit as well as other Kalso Earth shoes I've purchased. They seem to be changing the ""duck foot"" or ""clown shoe"" shape to be more and more conventionally ""fashionable"". Anyway, these are too wide at the heels and the shoes slip partway off with every step. The elastic at the sides of the heel does not fit tightly enough to keep my feet in the shoes. Also the shoes are not wide enough at the balls of the feet, just below the toes, the widest parts of my feet.

"The lovely fabric is light and airy but not see-through. This machine washes easily on gentle and hangs dry in only minutes with almost no wrinkles, touch-up if necessary with light iron or steamer. The color is beautiful and does not easily fade. The pieces are well cut and sewn with high quality, nothing crooked, seams all very straight and flat. The stitching is even, there are no loose threads.The pattern is new to me as it is three separate pieces. I prefer the three layered, one  piece Saudi style because it is more simple to put on/ easier to wear than this, that is the only reason I do not give 5 stars. This design requires a bit more time and pins to secure well. There is a rectangle hijab (over hair/head) piece, a headband/tie piece which goes on the forehead and the face veil, niqab piece, all three are separate. I suppose I could sew them all together to make them a bit easier. Those familiar with this style will probably love it. One advantage to the separate pieces is the face, niqab, may be worn with other top pieces for a mix-and-match set of hijab one color, niqab another color.

"This is a good sack for shopping but it has a design flaw which can cause expensive damage to nice garments. There is a padded part of the shoulder strap made to store the bag when not in use. This little pouch + shoulder pad combination has a  has a velcro closure. When wearing anything sheer or fine (like nylon or knit) the hook side of the velcro in the shoulder strap can catch and snag a nice shirt, blouse, dress or scarf. This could be avoided if the hook-side of the velcro were not about 4 times the size of the catch-side of the velcro. Because there is always unavoidable exposed hook-side velcro (as the catch-side does not fully cover it) snags happen and ruin nice garments being worn when using the sacks. They could either make both sides of the velcro equal so there could be no hook-side exposed or have the smaller section be the hook-side so the exposed, uncovered part would be the smooth catch-side.I will need to use tape or do some sewing or seem ripping to make my bag safe to use.

"This fits my fine and would be great if the ruffles were more generous. I suspect the quality suffers from an attempt to save money by using the minimum amount of fabric possible to still sew this style. If they made each line of ruffles about an inch wider and overlapped the layers so there would be no gaps without ruffle coverage, it would be much better. The ruffles should also be longer in overall length so they could be gathered more, giving volume to the rows of ruffle. Each strip probably lays out flat about 12"" before sewing but would be much better if the strips were about 6"" longer then gathered (a sewing term for being puckered before sewing on the base) more fully. As it is it is a good idea but not well excuted in terms of design, The sewing is well enough done, but sewing well if the design is flawed, doesn't improve a garment.I will probably buy more because of lack of market choice. If a competitor offered one made as I describe, it would be much higher value for money. I suspect that this company makes man more first time sales and not a many repeat sales because people really want this garment but are disappointed with it when it comes. As it is the price is too high for the value. If they were made wit more fabric in he ways I suggest, I would feel much better about a $26 price point! I hope anyone wearing this due to chemo/illness will have a full recovery.

"The three I received were each slightly different shades of white. The fabric is cheap, too-thin (a little see-through), synthetic jersey. The white looks slightly grey or slightly dirty. I also do not like the pattern because of the seam placement under the chin and down the front center of the neck; this seam should be out-of-sight, in back.I also do not want the hair knot or bun room to be at the back top crown angled as it is about 90 degrees from vertical. This dictates a hairstyle that many women will not , as I, want to wear. I am not fond of the weird, pointy-head look putting one's hair up like this gives, but worse, it is a very uncomfortable hairstyle for me, causing my scalp to ache after an hour or so.  Not stuffing the hair into this bulge means the piece has an empty area and doesn't fit as it would without the ""hair sack"". The bottom of the neck all the way around is also too short, making it hard to have coverage because it does not reach and tuck into many collar designs. It should be at least 5 inches longer at the bottom, all the way around.Because this is about the only pattern and fabric available in a ninja underscarf, I must settle for this  not very satisfactory garment. It is better than nothing, but not pleasing. The price is also too high as this is a garment one must have many of, changing them every day, sometimes twice a day. It is flimsy, not strong enough to hold up to constant washing. It is like underwear, it should be affordable, durable and well-made so a woman may have enough of these to be well covered every day.

But it has a nice, brushed finish everywhere except the small, pointed end pieces of the bullet-shaped light holders (about 1.6 inch ""caps""), which add visual interest. The bullet-shaped light holders have 2 little ""rocket fins"" each, also adding to the cool factor with a retro-pop look.

It would stand to reason the same company could make a good paper towel, but that just isn't the case. I love that these are safer for the environment and use no chlorine. I truly want to like these, but I just can't stand them! I care about the environment, but environmentally safe products can't be so hard to use or of such bad quality that they are a waste of money.I am looking forward to using up the case and buying something else. I want to buy environmentally sound products, but it is unreasonable to spend more money than for ""regular"" paper towels for a product that is much worse than ""regular"" paper towels.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16813PFC5INC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TM4X7G#wasThisHelpful","R16813PFC5INC7","A37Z843SR49K8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37Z843SR49K8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought 2 of these red recycled glass vases from My Eco Glass, this one, the 7-3/4""  Munich and the 6-3/4"" glass ball vase. They were each a different shade of red so could not be used as a set. This one is a good shape, with reasonably thick, not too fragile glass and a nice enough shade or slightly orange-ish red. The others where more purple-ish-red.

"This arrived 13 days after ordering, but the long shipping time was as stated in the ordering process. They send these one at a time from China, which seems inefficient, but that is not a deal breaker for me. This skin is somewhat opaque, being a rather milky, whitish color of silicone and less clear than other keyboard skins, this makes the keys unnecessarily harder to read.The big problem is the skin does not fit exactly. I have a correct model PC and this skin was clearly made for it, but it is slightly stretched in the gaps between some keys. Everything is in the right place and the key shapes are the correct size, there is small warping in the spaces between keys. Very small distance errors make a big difference on something like this which needs to fit almost perfectly. It bulges and ripples in spots and does not lay flat. This interferes with typing and causes increased errors. If I had to guess what the problem is, I'd say the skin was unevenly pulled off the mold when hot, thereby slightly stretched/deformed during the manufacturing process, before it cooled.I have used other keyboard skins before of much better quality, This cost way too much to be so badly made. I suppose it is better than no protection, but maybe not, because it is causing slowed typing, mistakes and the keys are much harder to read, I will ask for a refund. Maybe I just received a bad one, but you might not want to gamble with your time and money on one of these.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R396N9VRIU8XY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F30K6TC#wasThisHelpful","R396N9VRIU8XY2","A37Z843SR49K8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37Z843SR49K8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The positives: it is a nice shape, like a fishbowl, about the size of a large cantaloupe. It has a good color, a purplish red.  It is a good weight, not too light, won't knock over too easily.The negatives: It is made in two pieces and pressed together leaving raised glass lines up 2 sides. A globe-vase looks better when made of one piece, without seams.Also, I bought two other vases by the same maker/seller also of the red, recycled glass. I assumed the vases would all match, but the colors do not match. Each of the 3 vases is a different shade of red; one is more purple, one more orange, one in the middle-red range.This isn't a bad vase, some will like it. The price ($17.50) seems slightly high for this quality. If you are trying to make a set with others in this ""group"", the colors are not the same from vase to vase.

"I bought the Basil All purpose cleaner with the Lemon Verbena Glass Cleaner. The all purpose goes a long way. 1/4 cup mixes with  1 gallon (64 ounces) of water to make cleaner for most household surfaces. Put it in an empty spray bottle from whatever cleaner you used to use. It does nice work with out feeling harsh or toxic. The glass cleaner also does a nice job on windows, mirrors, etc..The basil scent is not very true to what I think basil should be. It smells more vanilla-ish than it should, to me. The scent stays in the room and I like that aspect. Nothing overpowering like pine-sol, but a nice, light scent to make the room seem freshly cleaned. I prefer the geranium to the basil, but everyone will have their own taste in which scent is best. These cleaners is a great alternative to the harsh, strong, chemical, commercial stuff with names like ""Zoom"" and ""Pow"".

"UPDATE (October, 2015):  These were higher priced when released, but currently the prices for 2400 mah AA batteries and 2000 mAh AA batteries can be very close, depending on when you buy.  If that's the case when you're buying, for many people it probably makes sense to go with these higher capacity batteries.These batteries have been great to use over the past year and a half.  We don't use them intensively, and don't usually fully discharge them.  So the reduced life (in terms of the number of charge cycles) isn't a big factor for us.  500 full charge cycles is several years of use for us, or anyone else who uses them even a couple times per week, on average.If you can get a great deal on some of the other AA  options, you may want to consider them.  Also consider your needs, in terms of how often you charge them and whether you will use them often enough to get the benefit of a higher number of cycles.  The newer Eneloop batteries claim a life of up to 2100 charge cycles.  If you recharge them very often, batteries with a higher number of cycles in their life may be a better fit for you.(For us, we'd probably never get the benefit of 1000-2000 cycles on a set of batteries because that's 10-20 years worth of use for most of our applications.  By that time, it seems likely the basic chemistry of the battery will deteriorate, or much better batteries will come along, or we'll lose them or damage them.)Finally, my review is for the AA batteries.  Note that the additional benefit to the high capacity option for AAA batteries is much smaller - a difference of 50-100 mAh (850 vs. 750 or 800).  So again, the regular capacity batteries may be a good option for you.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -THE QUICK TAKE:  The AmazonBasics High Capacity AA Rechargeable batteries are a nice product, but that comes at a higher price (at current pricing).  Unless you need the extra capacity of a 2400 mAh battery, you may want to get the regular 2000 mAh Eneloop or AmazonBasics batteries at a lower price.  Similarly, if you don't need to store them before using them, conventional rechargeables will do the job.The product description on the Amazon product page has a good summary, if you're not familiar with the advantages of ""pre-charged"" or ""low-self discharge"" batteries.  This is a somewhat new technology, available in the last 10 years or so;  the batteries are slow to lose their charge, so they can be sold charged and ready to use; and will hold a charge for some time.  It's only relatively recently that higher-capacity versions have been available.If cost isn't important, and you don't want to have to figure out which battery is which - then sure, stock up on these.  But given the cost, most people will want to use these where they are needed.DO YOU NEED THE CAPACITY?  You're paying more for an extra 25% capacity; unless you have a high-drain device that will use that charge, you may be able to use the regular capacity version - such as the AmazonBasics 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries, 1000 Cycle (Typical 2000mAh, Minimum 1900mAh) or eneloop AA 1800 cycle,  Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries, 8 Pack.  Cameras are a good example of a use where the extra capacity could be important.  Slower-draining children's toys, on the other, may not need these batteries.DO YOU NEED LOW SELF DISCHARGE?  If you're looking for a high-capacity battery and you don't plan to store the batteries before using them - for example, you're able to charge your camera batteries each night - there's no need to pay extra for the LSD feature.CYCLES:  Note that these high capacity batteries also state a life of 500 cycles, versus 1000 cycles or more on the regular capacity batteries.  Many people overstate the importance of this - if you use even 500 cycles, you're getting your money's worth; and honestly, if you're recharging them within a few days of use, you don't need LSD batteries - regular rechargeables will do.  Still, it's another example of how you may want to use these batteries selectively.USE A SMART CHARGER:  You'll want to use a charger that charges each battery individually, often referred to as a smart charger.The ones I received have a black top, and are made in Japan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVU5K7M5LM61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZV9WTM#wasThisHelpful","R2WVU5K7M5LM61","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The design of these mugs is very attractive.  The edge and walls are thin, making it more elegant than chunky.However, after a year and half we've noticed that the coffee stain is building up inside.  They also stain more easily from spoons (stirring inside the cup).  Something about the finish, I assume, that isn't as stain resistant as most other porcelain.By the way, we also had one mug shattered upon arrival.

"Traveler2014, J. Lalor and persona non grata provide very helpful info.And yes, it's a fair amount of effort to get this working with good rates.  If you just plan to use it for one trip, you may want to consider other alternatives.  If you plan to visit the UK more than once, some additional info:TOP-UPS: As others have noted, when I tried this in 2013, I also found it was more or less impossible to top this up from the US.  But shops in the airport sell top-ups, so you can get this SIM and your phone number before you go, and get the phone working quickly.UNLOCK YOUR PHONE:  Even though you can't top it up, having the SIM before you go lets you make sure your phone is really unlocked.  That's critical.When you get to the UK (or online if you want to set that up) -- You will be on a Starter plan until you pick an Animal plan, which you can do by calling 343.  You may also be able to create an account online to do this.- CHOOSE A PLAN BEFORE YOU TOP UP: If you haven't chosen an ""Animal Plan,"" do so BEFORE YOU TOP UP, as there are bonuses applied when you top up if you select a plan first.  I like the Dolphin plan for the data; a £10 top-up currently gets you 400 free texts and 1GB of data as a bonus; if you're planning to call the US, you may want the Camel plan (though it's no longer showing as available online).  In either case, you get a bonus and you can still use the top-up credit to buy minutes. Search on Orange Animal Plans Pay As You Go, and Pay As You Go Price Guide on the EE site.- BUY AN EXTRA: Buy an ""Extra"" to get the cheapest rates.  For example, ¬£7.50 gets you 100 UK minutes good for 1 month; ¬£5.00 buys 30 minutes for calls from Western Europe good for 1 month.  You lose any unused minutes, but having a working phone with voice, text and data for your trip is well worth the ¬£10-15 or so it will cost you.Buy an Extra online, or by sending text to 6620 (after you have a balance of credit on the phone):¬£7.50 -  100 UK minutes - 1 month - ¬£0.08/min - Text this: MINS 7.5¬£5.00 - 30 minutes from Western Europe - 1 month - ¬£0.17/min - Text this:  W EURO MINS 5You can also do this online, once you set up an online account and have credit on the account.There are lots of other options - do a web search on Orange Pay As You Go Priceguide to find the current PDFA few other comments:- In the UK, it's the person placing the call who pays the charge for the call.- The SIMs shipping now seem to be a micro-SIM with a holder to fit around the micro SIM so it fits inside a full size slot if needed.  That will fit an iPhone through 4S, but not an iPhone 5 which uses a nano-SIM.  See the Apple page entitled, ""Understanding which SIM card your iPhone or iPad uses.""- If you have an AT&T iphone, or a Verizon iPhone 4S or later, contact AT&T or Verizon to get it unlocked well before you go.  (More generally, make sure you have an unlocked phone, with the right frequency bands.)- Keep the PIN number you get in the second message, it's needed if you want to contact Orange or create an online account.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTC23G6ESNWYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J4E7K6#wasThisHelpful","RTC23G6ESNWYO","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The NVidia GTX 750 series cards are a new line from NVidia, using a new chip design called Maxwell.  They're a big jump forward in efficiency, in terms power per watt, which allows you to install them in most desktops without upgrading the power supply or enhancing the cooling and still get much-improved performance.  The new Maxwell graphics processing unit (GPU), along with 1GB of GDDR5 memory, allows you to get the most performance out of one PCI bus-powered card.This card perfectly fit what I needed to upgrade my system to allow me to do video encoding effectively.  While I'd have no problem replacing my power supply, I just don't have the time or feel the need to do it, given my computing needs.Depending on your needs and current card prices, consider two other cards:- The ""Superclocked"" version of the card this review is posted for, EVGA GTX 750 Superclock w/ 1GB GDDR5, which has a faster clock speed and will perform a little better when you're maxing out the card.  If the price difference is small, go with that card.- The EVGA GTX 750Ti Superclock w/ 2GB GDDR5 will give you the maximum performance for a card powered by only the PCI-e slot.LOW POWER NEEDS:  This GTX 750 card is a good bet if you're looking to keep power and cooling needs down.  According to the NVidia site, this card needs a minimum of a 300 Watt power supply, with a current rating of 20 amps on the +12 volt rail.  A standard Dell 350W power supply has 25 amps on the +12V rail.  Total power draw is just 55 watts, well under the 75 watts the PCI-e slot delivers.  So you can put this card into many desktop systems without the hassle of upgrading the power supply or concerns about cooling.If you're considering one of the other 750 or 750 Ti cards, check the NVidia site for power needs.  Most of them are designed to use just the power from the PCI-e slot.But some overclocked cards with more complex cooling systems (like the Asus) have a 6-pin power supply connector. That's probably not necessary as all GTX 750 boards have on-board power limiting circuitry that keeps it from drawing more than 75W.  Just check to see if the card uses it, and if your power supply has that connector.NEW KING OF LOW POWER HTPC CARDS:  The nvidia GTX 750 / 750 Ti is the new king of home theater PC (HTPC) cards for lower-powered systems, for those willing to have a small and quiet fan (like the one on this 01G-P4-2751-KR card).  The Radeon HD 7750 (such as this XFX AMD Radeon HD 7750 Card) has generally been considered the card with the best performance among quiet cards, until now.750 IS A LIMITED VERSION OF THE 750 TI:  The 750 has most of the same features as the 750 Ti, as it's an identical graphics chip with fewer components. Anandtech has a nice article detailing the differences between the 750 and the 750 Ti, search for it.TWO SLOTS:  Note that while these cards use only one slot for power, all of the current GTX 750 cards use two slots worth of space, and some with more complex cooling are notably longer than this card.LOTS OF VARIATIONS:  There are a lot of GTX 750 cards out already, and more are coming.  The GPU sections are the same, so differences will primarily be the parts of the card designed by the manufacturer:1) Clock Speed:  There are overclock / superclock versions as well.  They're very stable, so if you're looking to max out performance, consider those.2) Ports:  Port configurations vary as well across cards and manufacturers.  I like the way this card is set up with the ports along one slot, to allow air from outside the case to get pulled in through the second slot location.  If you want to run two DVI monitors, it's easy to convert the HDMI port to DVI using an adapter, or an HDMI to DVI Adapter Cable.3) Graphics memory:  If you're running multiple monitors, you may want to go with the 2GB versions.4) Cooling:  The cooling differences are the most obvious, it's where the manufacturers get creative and try to differentiate their products.  There's a wide range of cooling systems, with single fan and dual fan, heat sinks and pipes.  If you have to ask, you probably don't need it.5) Form factor:  Low profile cards have been announced but aren't generally available for sale as of now (March 2014).EVGA IS A GOOD CHOICE:  Several manufacturers make versions of the GTX 750 cards.  Different people have their favorite companies, but many like the EVGA customer service and 3 year warranty.COOLING MATTERS:  Keep in mind that all a fancy cooling system does is draw the heat from the card and put it into your case.  Unless you're willing to upgrade the cooling on your case, you may want to be careful how many watts of heat you add.A GREAT VALUE FOR MANY USERS:  Some have criticized the card because, for the money, it's not the highest performing card.  That's a narrow view, and not a useful view for everyone.  If raw performance is all that matters to you, and you already have plenty of spare power supply capacity and good cooling, then another card would likely be a better choice.But if you're looking to sharply upgrade your graphics card and video connectivity, without the effort of replacing your power supply or worries about cooling - the GTX 750 is unbeatable at the moment, and likely will be for some time to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NHCOUSLO6EBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDG3NDY#wasThisHelpful","R3NHCOUSLO6EBC","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The refurbished Acer Chromebook C720-2802 is a good value at one hundred fifty dollars if you primarily plan to use it for web applications such as browsing, email, media, and so on, and aren't getting it for an intensive user who likes to keep 30 tabs open (think about more memory for them).  It's a good match for children or other basic users, or as a second device.  It's designed to be easy to setup, use and maintain.The hardware is limited but adequate for the uses above, and better than most other Chromebooks.  The upside of the hardware limitations is the long 8 hour battery life (as a laptop, or for displaying video about 6.5 hours).This is a newer model (the C720 series was introduced in fall 2013) with a number of improvements from the older C710 series, including longer battery life and smaller size.Other than being dinged for the bland design, it has gotten very positive reviews in late 2013 and early 2014.  Look for the Endgadget C720 review page for links to a number of reviews.  People like the trackpad.PORTABLE AND SMALL:  The compact size and light weight make it very portable.  However, the screen size and keyboard size may be too small for some users, depending on their hand size and their eyesight.  It's a 11.6"" HD Widescreen LCD display (1366 x 768 resolution) with a matte coating.  The keyboard is smaller and has less ""travel"" (up and down range of motion) than larger computers, but I found it easy to get used to and have no trouble typing on it.This laptop measures 11.3"" by 8"" x 0.8"" and weighs 2.76 pounds.CHROMEBOOK:  In case you don't know, a Chromebook is not a Windows or Mac computer.  It's based on the Google Chrome suite, and the operating system is Chrome OS.  This works fine if *all* the applications you need are on the web.  But note that it will not run Skype (a Microsoft product), or let you install any other software (including drivers for mice or printers).  So printing is somewhat cumbersome (depending on your setup) and not all USB drives and devices will work.However, the Chrome OS and Chromebooks have some substantial advantages, besides the price:  you don't have to buy any software or hardware; you don't have mess around with Windows for software updates, dealing with problems, etc.; virus protection is built in; and if you have issues with software you can easily re-load all the software with a ""PowerWash.""FAST BOOT:  Because this uses Chrome OS and a Solid State Drive, it boots very quickly - less than 10 seconds usually.ACER:  Acer is the fourth largest computer company in the world, after Lenovo, HP and Dell, and ahead of Asus.  They also sell computers under the Gateway and Packard Bell brand names.REFURBISHED:  Computers sold as refurbished aren't new.  Sometimes they've been repaired, sometimes they are just returns.  Some may have cosmetic damage - but they should not have any functional issues. You do need to be prepared to return the item if there's a problem, so it may not be for everyone.  But for most people, it's a way to get a great value on a laptop that will work as well as a new one.  You'll forget it's refurbished.90 DAY WARRANTY:  As a refurbished computer, the warranty is only 90 days.  Typically problems appear early on, and there aren't many moving parts in this computer.  But the shorter coverage is one reason why this costs less.2GB OF RAM, MAXIMUM:  The maximum amount of memory that can be installed is the 2 GB that this ships with.  That's enough for most web applications, but not enough for intensive applications like complex photo or video editing.  It is fairly fast PC3-12800 DDR3 memory, though.MODEST PROCESSOR: The Intel¬Æ Celeron¬Æ 2955U dual-core processor runs at 1.4GHz and has a CPU benchmark score of 1533.  It's fine for the uses described above, but only comparable in processing power to the netbooks that were so popular a few years ago.  However, it is a newer processor (released Fall 2013), so the Intel¬Æ HD graphics are improved and the newer Ultra Low Voltage processors extend the battery life.  It's also a more capable processor than some other Chromebooks, which use tablet-quality processors.LIMITED STORAGE SO USE THE CLOUD: The 16GB solid state drive won't hold many files; about 10GB of the space is free for your files.  So plan on using the cloud and/or flash drives for your storage needs.  There is a built in SD card reader as well.USB 3.0: You may not think this matters to you, but it does.  If you want to use flash drives, external hard drives or a memory card reader, USB 3.0 is far faster than USB 2.0. There's one USB 3.0 port and one USB 2.0 port on this laptop.SOME NICE FEATURES:  The C720-2802 includes the essential features -  wifi, stereo speakers, a basic webcam - as well as as well as some nice features not found on all low price computers - Bluetooth 4.0 for wireless connections to a phone or speakers; and  HDMI to connect video devices, displays or a TV.  However, as with all of these tiny laptops, there is no optical drive (DVD).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MG57KJDG1ZSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJD3QTC#wasThisHelpful","R3MG57KJDG1ZSI","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're considering The Interior Design Reference Manual, it's probably because you're considering getting an NCIDQ certification.  It's carefully designed to map to the test, so for that end it's an indispensable tool.But if you're considering certification, you're probably thinking about the value that will bring to you.  Certainly preparing for the exam will give you something important - an understanding of the various domains of knowledge needed to be effective in interior design.  It's important to have some working knowledge of a wide range of areas, as the work of a designer builds on and relies on the work of other specialties.  The Interior Design Reference Manual gives you a good basic survey of a number of design and building areas, as well as areas more specific to interior design (such as lighting, finishes, woodworking).  It's very useful to have a comprehensive presentation of the things you need to know.The challenge will be to use that knowledge, so that you reinforce it and add to it.  Otherwise, like so many other things you've learned in your life, you'll know it just long enough to take the test.You might also be considering whether to seek certification in terms of the career impact and value it will bring.  It's worth doing a little work to evaluate which of the certifications in Interior Design to pursue, if any, and what value they bring to your career.  Be sure to talk to some practicing designers, and ask them what makes a good designer, and what they look for when they hire new designers or assistants.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L30C23BESGY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591264278#wasThisHelpful","R2L30C23BESGY2","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Belkin Clear Screen Protector is the most complete kit I've seen, with the best instructions.  (Though I do have a few additions, see below.)  The kit includes 2 screen protectors, a cleaning cloth, and a dust pick-up sticker (used after you clean the screen).  The screen protectors have black or white tabs so you know which side to peel first.You definitely do want a screen protector for your iPad and iPhone, it's easy to end up with a scratch.  The protectors to do not affect the use - your iPad still works well with a screen protector.The instructions inside the cover of the packaging go through how to install.  It is a little challenging with the size of the iPad.  A few additional comments:- Clean the screen with a damp, soft, lint free, cotton cloth. (Cotton is a softer fiber than paper or synthetic fabrics.)  An old cotton dishtowel or t-shirt is a good bet. (Old fabric has less lint.) Let it dry.  Then clean it again with the Belkin cloth.- Look at the screen carefully to remove all the lint before starting. Use the included sticker.- Before removing the adhesive covering sheet, line up the screen protector and get a sense for how it fits. Make a plan to align it with an edge and the main button. Note how much space you have on either long side, so you know where the protector needs to be to fit properly on the main button.- After removing the adhesive covering on the screen protector, apply it to one edge - as the instructions suggest, use a long edge to get it on straight, checking the main button location - and work your way to the other side.- Squeeze out the bubbles from the center outward, in each direction.If it's not perfect, don't obsess.  Try using it, I find I don't notice a few small bubbles when I'm using it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31WQQOZQQUDT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BDJ81Q#wasThisHelpful","R31WQQOZQQUDT4","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Newhouse Lighting LED lamp is the perfect dorm or kids' room light.  Unfortunately, I don't entirely mean that as a compliment.  Let me explain ...Pros:+ The lamp gets the light right.  The light is smooth, thanks to the diffuser over the LEDs.+ The 3000K light is a nice color - ""bright warm light"" as it says on the box.+ It's about the right brightness for a close-up lamp - 300 lumens which is about the equivalent of 30 watts of incandescent.  And as an LED, it doesn't get hot, and doesn't warm you up.+ The clamp holds very well.+ The neck of the light is strong enough to stay in any position you bend it.  So it can be used in almost any configuration.Issues:- The switch for the lamp is on the cord, about 6"" down.  So depending on where you have it, you may be fishing around behind or beside the furniture it's attached to, trying to find the switch.- The clamp seems to work well, but it's such a prominent feature (4.5"" D x 3"" W) they should have given some thought to making it more attractive.Also, to me it would have been nice if the neck were a color other than silver - say, the same color as the head of the lamp.  But that's a matter of personal taste.Overall, it could be easier to use the switch and the lamp could be more attractive.  The lamp head itself looks good, the neck less so, the clamp not so much.  So, it's the perfect dorm room light, but a little less perfect in another setting.Luckily, you can decide for yourself about the looks, and think about whether having the switch on the cord will work for you.  The light functions well and works better in a number of respects than other similar lights.The clamp is about 1"" deep and 3"" wide, if you're trying to judge whether it will attach where you want the lamp to attach.UPDATE November 2015:  I'd still assess the lamp just as I described.  I still don't love the clamp (though it is very strong).  But for the right use, it's a great lamp - so I'm raising the rating from 4 to 5 stars. I want to emphasize two things:1) The light from this lamp is very nice, especially compared to other LED lights.  They really got the light right.  It's a nice, bright, warm color.  It's very smooth.  The bulb is a single, glowing, lit surface - not an annoying row of bright, distracting LEDs like so many other lamps.2) The neck is very good at bending into many useful shapes, and holding in place.I liked this enough that I bought another one for our kids room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FLNAY8NNFOQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FIYJXAQ#wasThisHelpful","R1FLNAY8NNFOQO","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just what I needed, and luckily I remembered to order it from Amazon before the snow fell so it would be in stock.The steel blade gives it enough sturdiness to survive the mix of snow we get in New England, including some ice; and to clean the surface well.Obviously with a steel tool, you want to be a little careful with uneven surfaces or anything that might get damaged.  You're not quite swinging an axe, but it's kind of the same idea.I will say that while I read the comments that it's a heavy shovel, I somewhat downplayed those.  However, it is noticeably heavy and does add some effort to the overall work of shoveling the snow.  It's a good and necessary trade off for me, and I can use the exercise.  But have no doubt it's a heavyish shovel, even for a manly man.If you have space for more than one shovel, this shovel and a lighter one would be a great set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R356PW5XESG70S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LJMZNQ#wasThisHelpful","R356PW5XESG70S","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It should be obvious that the Defender series is a chunkier case, for those looking for more protection for their iPhone.  (If you're looking for a slimmer case that still offers good protection, try the OtterBox Commuter Series.)I'm a big fan of the OtterBox cases.  (I've tried a number of others, and they don't really stack up.)- OtterBoxes are well designed - they include the features I want, and some I didn't know I needed.- They fit well, and more generally match the features of the phone carefully.  OtterBox gets something that apparently isn't obvious to other case makers - you not only want to use all the features of the phone, but you want to use them in an easy and enjoyable way. - The materials are well chosen to provide strength, grip and durability.  (That said, some of my Defender cases developed splits in the skinnier bits, like near the connector.)The screen protector is well made and reasonably easy to apply.  Be sure to put it on.  A few tips for applying the screen protector: - Clean it with a damp, soft, lint free, cotton cloth.  (Cotton is a softer fiber than paper or synthetic fabrics.)  An old cotton dishtowel or t-shirt is a good bet.  (The old part means it has less lint.)  Let it dry.- Look at the screen carefully to remove all the lint before starting.- Before removing the adhesive covering sheet, line up the screen protector and get a sense for how it fits.  Make a plan to align it with an edge and the main button.  Note how much space you have on either long side, so you know where it needs to be to fit properly on the main button.- After removing the adhesive covering on the screen protector, apply it to one edge - I use a long edge to get it on straight, checking the main button location - and work your way to the other side.- Squeeze out the bubbles from the center outward, in each direction.I get a year or two out of the screen protectors, so it's worth some effort to get it on right.I like the fact that the headphone jack has a cover, as I don't use it a lot I prefer to keep out the fuzz and goo.  However, when I do try to use it, not every plug wants to fit into the available space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RON1H7I9MOZSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SUHRH6#wasThisHelpful","RON1H7I9MOZSW","A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EF8N7ZE7ONWX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
