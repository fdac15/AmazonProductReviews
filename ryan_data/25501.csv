"The Biography of Maggie Smith reads like a telephone book. The author recites facts that can be found on Wikipedia and IMBD and manages to write in such a pompous and mind-numbing manner that I could hardly recognize Maggie Smith. He begins the book by categorizing the three great British female actors: Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Vanessa Redgrave. Redgrave doesnâ€™t belong on this short list of mature women. So I was skeptical about his views from the get go.His recitation of places Maggie lived, when she became Maggie instead of Margaret, where she went to school, etc. is all written in a very pedantic style destined to remove her sparkle and wit despite his references to these qualities she is known for bringing to her characters.I cannot believe that Maggie Smith sanctioned or approved this biography, but apparently she did so quite reluctantly and agreed to meet Michael briefly on several occasions.  She succeeded in preserving her privacy perfectly.His recitation of her five appearances in the Harry Potter films (I havenâ€™t watched one of them), his interpretation of her performance and character in â€œDownton Abbey,â€ or the two Marigold Hotel films left me cold.The is a pedantic stultifying biography -I had to force myself to read every word in order to post this review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RPB8ICEN7R44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250081483#wasThisHelpful","R2RPB8ICEN7R44","A1IH42TUIZ2XJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH42TUIZ2XJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Th Bissell is both bagless and cordless. It is very powerful and the Lithium Ion Battery charges quickly. It has to be removed from the Bissell and charged in a special unit that comes with the vac. While it is noisy, and I have yet to know of a quiet vac that has suction, it is very effective on both carpeting, wood and tile floors. Everything you need is stored in one unit except for the charger.I have two cats and one  of them is a long-haired fellow and they both shed 24/7. This Bissell picks up everything quickly.Because it has a powerful motor, it has some heft to it, but the handle is well placed and it is easy to maneuver. It also allows one to reach and vacuum higher spaces because of its handy attached wand. It is compact and easy to store in a narrow space.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNB0DYSUP6MZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012S2118C#wasThisHelpful","RNB0DYSUP6MZ8","A1IH42TUIZ2XJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH42TUIZ2XJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jay Winikâ€™s â€œ1944â€ is a truly remarkable expose of the good, the bad and the unforgivable  unprecedented four term (albeit incomplete due to FDRâ€™s death early on in his 4th term) presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.The good: The Lend-Lease Program, a brilliant solution to helping our allies before the US entered the Second World War.FDRâ€™s ability to charm the public and get congress to go along with what he determined was in the best interests of the US.His excellence as commander-in-chief of the USAâ€™s military forces during preparations for D-Day.His ability to â€œmobilize the war industry to produce 2 million trucks; 300,000 warplanes; more than 100,00 tanks, 87,000 warships, 5,000 cargo ships; over 20 million rifles, machine guns and pistols; and 44 million rounds of ammunition-the equivalent of building two Panama Canals every month.â€His emphasis on founding the United Nations, and a Refugee Affairs Department.The bad: his failure to oversee the nefarious doings in the US Department of State and the War Department where his appointees hid information from him.His inability to address a situation until it reached a crisis point.The unforgivable: His interment of Japanese Americans after Pear Harbor.His failure to accept the docking of the St. Louis, a ship filled with almost 1,000 refugees fleeing Hitlerâ€™s murder of European Jews, after it was turned away from Cuba.His failure to bomb rail lines leading to Auschwitz.His failure to rescue refugees from Hitlerâ€™s grasp although isolationist America had not yet filled any of its the quotas.His failure to believe and read telegrams and reports and counsel from those who had first-hand information about Nazi atrocities.His late entry into WWII after the Nazis had gobbled up every European nation except for Switzerland, Spain & Portugal.Reading Winikâ€™s â€œ1944â€ enlightened me and the pages engrossed me from beginning to end. It is a must read work of non-fiction!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24X6NQBLFPW2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439114080#wasThisHelpful","R24X6NQBLFPW2Q","A1IH42TUIZ2XJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH42TUIZ2XJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a far better model than my previous Philips Sonicare Airfloss unit. It can be adjusted for one, two or three spurts of air. It really removes food and other matter stuck between teeth and is an excellent addition to one's oral health supplies. This kit came with a special rinse to put into the cavity of the unit. I generally use a diluted mixture of mouthwash and water. It is cordless and recharges quickly on its base. The only thing that's a bit tricky is positioning it so that you can pour the mouthwash mixture into the cavity. Also, the cavity is just big enough to hold liquid for one thorough use. This is not a multi-family unit, but meant for individual use inasmuch as it only comes with the one attachment for use. I am very pleased with this unit, but, because of my modest dental background, I still floss, use the Airfloss and brush throughly. I am pleased to say that my dental hygienist always compliments me about how clean and healthy my teeth and gums are.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YR8K209J5MF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67KBK#wasThisHelpful","R1YR8K209J5MF8","A1IH42TUIZ2XJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IH42TUIZ2XJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using prepaid phone for more than 10 years, the latest one I have been with is Tracfone (carrier is Verizon). My friend refers me to the H2O prepaid program (carrier is AT&T) due to its lower minimum deposit requirement, $10 for a 90-day period, instead of $20 for a 90-day period from Tracfone. I live in Cupertino, CA. Both T-mobile and Sprint do not have good coverage in my area (tried before).  I am not sure if AT&T has  good coverage in my area. The SIM card is virtually free. So, there is not much down side to give it a try.After receiving the SIM card, the on-line activation process is very fast. I drive around my area and AT&T coverage is good. The phone minute rate and test message rate from H2O's prepaid program are good. But the rate for mobile data is way too expensive (more like rip-off). I don't intend to use the mobile data from H2O as I use Karma pre-paid hot-spot for mobile data (they have much better rate for data).All in all, if your phone and text message usages are low and you don't plan to use mobile data, then H2O's prepaid plan is excellent.If mobile data is needed, stay away from H2O's prepaid plan then.For my intended use case, H2O's pre-pain plan is great, so I switch from Tracfone to H2O.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWDBUWAMZ1OYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT1L9ZE#wasThisHelpful","RWDBUWAMZ1OYO","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used the counter-top George Forman electrical grill before. It's OK to prepare small amount of food for 1 or 2 persons, but for a small family of 4, it just won't cut it. This ""George Foreman GFO201RX Indoor/Outdoor Electric Grill"" is a nice upgrade from the small electrical grill as it has a much bigger cooking space, but it also can be used either indoor or outdoor.Though I am handy in home maintenance work and it takes just about 10 to 15 minutes to put the whole thing together easily. Honestly, I think the assembly work is easy for most of people.It's good that the grill comes with a stand. However, the stand post does not integrate with the stand base tightly. The stand is somewhat wobbling when the heavy grill is in place. I am able to improve the situation by enhancing the binding between stand post and stand base with gorilla glue. Well, the down-side is not able to separate the stand post from the stand base anymore....not a big deal.A dial with 5 selection is used to control heat level. The included manual does not specify the temperature associated with each selection. Per my infrared thermometer, the grill surface temperature (without any food) is around 200ºF when the dial is at 1. And the temperature (without any food) is around 500ÂºF when the dial is at 5. The low setting is good to keep food warm, while the high setting is hot enough to creat a nice sear mark on the food. When starting from cold, it takes less than 10 minutes to reach the 500ÂºF. Definitely faster than cooking with charcoal grills.In terms of cooking real estate, it claims 240 sq inch surface, but I think it is somewhere around 210 sq inch. I have no problem putting 8 burgers on the cooking plate and still have some room to flip them easily.For this model (GFO201RX), it has a ceramic surface, not the normally seen Teflon coated surface. I don't know if ceramic surface lasts 5 times longer than Teflon coated surface or not (claimed by manufacturer). However, I do appreciate the ceramic surface as I don't need to worry about the risk of having Teflon coating in my food. From post-cooking cleaning point of view, this ceramic plate can be easily cleaned by wiping with wet paper towels...very impressive.So far, we have used this grill for more than 10 times this summer, mainly during weekends as I like to grill in the backyard. We have tried steak, fish, shrimp, burger, chicken, vegetables. It takes couple of tries to get used to the temperature control, especially when cooking with think meat. After initial learning period, we are happy with the results.Though I think electrical grill is generally good, it does have some nuisances:1) There is no place to hang the cover. So, I need to place a table next to the grill to hold the cover.2) There is no place to hang the cooking utensils.

"A nice handy gadget for cleaning ashes, especially it's long enough to reach deep inside the grill to get to those hard-to-reach areas. The bottom L-shape metal plate works like a rack that scraps ash out effectively. After using it couple of times, I wonder how come I don't know the existence of this tool earlier. I would have purchased it by myself if I know how useful this tool is.Ash cleaning is not a heavy duty work, with that, I guess this metal tool could last for a long long time. I highly recommend this tool if you have a ceramic cooker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FP7U0GB2AK7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV7UPI0#wasThisHelpful","R3FP7U0GB2AK7Y","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A handy tool for me to remove hot grill rack from my Weber grill, so I can add additional charcoal during cooking, or I need to re-adjust the setting of my indirect cooking, or I need to add wet wood chips to my metal wood chip holder when I am smoking my food.It's strong and sturdy enough to lift and hold my grill rack. However, don't try to use it to lift metal covers of you cast-iron cookwares. This gripper is not designed for that kind of heavy-duty work.The only improvement I can think of is a longer handler to keep my hand farther away from the heat. For now, I am wearing a heat-resistance glove when using it.Be careful, it is not rust-proof and it would definitely rust if you just leave it in your backyard.All in all, I do recommend this convenient gadget if you cook with charcoal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU00J7U1ZDFVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV7K0QM#wasThisHelpful","RU00J7U1ZDFVY","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am searching online to find a small man-bag that I can carry around to hold my cell phone, wallet, car keys, reading glasses...etc. I don't want a bulky backpack-like bag, I don't want a purse-like bag,  I don't want a message bag, and I don't want a waist bag. Camel bag is OK, but most camel bags are still too big and bulky. Finally, I bump into this one. The price is very low. Even better yet, it is made of canvas, instead of cheap plastic material.  With this low price, I guess there is not much risk to give it a try.The shipping takes a while as it is shipped directly from China. After trying it on, I am very happy with this small bag as it meets my needs exactly...not too big or bulky, and not too small to be useless. My 7 inch tablet goes in easily. The canvas material does not make it looks cheap. The color and style make it a nice fit for man....yes, people can tell this is a man-bag. The overall build-quality is decent.The only downside is the short shoulder strap. I won't recommend this bag for people more than 5 feet 5 in height...unless you don't mind carrying a bag under your arm pit :-)Overall, I am very happy with this bag, I will get couple more as gifts for my brothers and nephews.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PWR7EW3OPIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y82LLR2#wasThisHelpful","R35PWR7EW3OPIN","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This grilling table is sold under several different brands in various discount stores. I got one from K-mart store couple of years ago. I  used it several times in camping events.  It always caught people's attention at the camp site. As shown in Amazon's photo, it has a hanger to hold paper towel, couple of hooks to hold cooking utensils, a mesh rack to hold items like plates and bowls. The two side tables are very convenient for preparing food and the center top table holds camping stove well.The whole grilling table can be easily folded up for transportation and storage. It's pretty steady when in use. I always recommend friends in the camping events to get one as it does improve camping experience.The surface of two side tables and the center top table are kind of slippery. Though the intend is not to get dirty easily. However, once a while, plates or bowls do slip away (and drop to the ground) while I am cooking. I take one point out for this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33J81UU1LILL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00192JGDU#wasThisHelpful","R33J81UU1LILL8","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the years, I have been through quite some monitors with various sizes, 17"", 19"", 22"", 24"". I have to say this HP 27"" monitor is pretty impressive from several factors. First of all, a 27"" inch monitor really gives me a big working space. I constantly VPN into office and work from home. I now can display several applications concurrently on the screen. This 27"" monitor indeed improves my productivity.Secondly, HP does a good job on the industry design of this 27"" monitor, it has sleek, elegant and clean appearance. It looks really appealing and modern.Finally, the color is vibrant, the image is sharp, crisp and clear. The 1920 x 1080 HD resolution along with its big screen size, makes it a great enjoyment watching movie on this monitor. I do try some quick action racing car movies, and there is no ghost effect from this monitor.I usually don't install vendor's software for monitors as PC does a good job in detecting monitor and picking up the right software driver. For this monitor, the included DVD software does do something beyond the generic software driver from window OS. The HP software helps to bring out the best performance of this 27"" monitor. I would strongly recommend users to install the included software.Yes, this monitor does not come with speaker. Not a big deal, most speakers embedded in monitors do not have good performance anyway. Wireless bluetooth speakers are commodities these days. It's easy to find decent bluetooth speakers with good price.The only thing I feel missing from this monitor is height adjustment. I can only tilt the monitor backwards. I would take half-point out due to this.By the way, this monitor uses glossy screen. Be careful if light reflection could be an issue in your room setting. Not a flaw, but be aware of this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NL6GRIN5PDVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQQN4WU#wasThisHelpful","R2NL6GRIN5PDVJ","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This microfiber drying pad is highly absorbent, but yet it dries quickly. And it is easily washed in the washing machine. It is quite big in size and takes up quite some counter-top space. It's good that it can be folded to adjust the length.Usually, I use dish towels on the counter to catch the overflow from hand-washed dishes.

"This is not a cheap oven mitts shown in Target, or Walmart. It's pretty high quality.From size point of view, it's pretty long and large.

The lined rubber grips works pretty well on ceramic or glass dishes that are usually slippery for maneuvering. Yes, it's heavy-duty, but I can still bent it easily.From appearance point of view, the dark grey color makes this oven mitts less messier even if it gets food stains. And it is machine washable.It's good that they put the rubber grip coating on both sides.

The two pockets are constructed with water-proof elastic material that can be expanded to hold stuff. One to hold iPhone 6 and the other one to hold car key, credit card and some cash. The zipper to close the pocket has locking mechanism. So, the zipper won't open by itself during running.The only issue I have with this running belt is the zipper. It's a little tight to operate the zipper when I receive the belt. I have to use wax to lubricate the zipper to make it easier to open and close.

"This Medline VEN6025 latex gloves are not meant to replace your regular household cleaning gloves. These are premium version of ""one-time-use"" latex gloves. These gloves are thinner and less durable than the regular household cleaning gloves, but thicker and more durable than the typical one-time-use disposable latex gloves. Also, it's cuff is shorter than household gloves, but longer than those generic disposable latex gloves.For real heavy duty work, I still recommend to stick to the household cleaning gloves. However, for real dirty or nasty cleaning tasks that you don't plan to clean and re-use the gloves, this Medline VEN6025 Venom latex gloves are very good choices.  One thing I don't like about those disposable latex gloves is they tend to be very slippery when getting wet. I am glad that these VEN6025 gloves are far less slippery than those average disposable latex gloves. Better yet, the slightly textured figure areas make them easier to grab things.These Medline VEN6025 are one size for all. They are a little loose for my medium-size hand. If your hand is on the smaller size, these gloves could be too big for you.Though these gloves are marketed as ""one-time-use"", I think these gloves can be reused couple of times as they are heavy duty.All in all, I am satisfied with these Medline VEN6025 latex gloves.

"This Samsung MotionSync Upright Vacuum is by far the most maneuverable ""corded"" vacuum machine I have ever used. I do have a cordless Dyson vacuum machine that is better than Samsung in maneuvering, but that's a battery-based vacuum with short and limited operation time. So, it's not a meaningful apple-to-apple comparison.The width of the beater is narrower then other vacuum machines I had before. That's good for moving around in tight corners. But, if you have big area to take care, this might mean more work for you though. This vacuum has a lower profile also. It's easier to get into areas under table, bed-frame, cabinets. In a nutshell, combining the (1) MotionSync, (2) narrower beater size, and (3) lower profile, this vacuum machine is perfect for rooms with a lot of tight corners, tables, chairs, cabinets.The noise level of this vacuum is on the low side comparing with most of the vacuum machines I have used. The canister is easy to detach and clean. The overall size of this vacuum is on the slim side and it occupies smaller storage footprint.In terms of sucking power, I have hard time to assess whether this vacuum does a better job than my other vacuum or not. To be honest, without special testing setup, I am wondering how people can tell one vacuum machine has better (or weaker) sucking power than another. All I can say, I see similar amount of stuff are picked up by this vacuum.In summary, I am satisfied with the overall performance of this Samsung vacuum machine. I take one point out as the price seems to be on the high side.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDK3DKNU1QEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOD3FM0#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDK3DKNU1QEA","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have carpet cleaner at home to shampoo carpet in heavy traffic areas about twice a year. So, I am used to the ""wet"" vacuum process. This Oreck Surface Scrub Hard Floor Cleaner works the same way like a carpet cleaner.It's virtually 90% assembled when I receive it. I just need to attach the handle. Two things get my attention right away....how light weight it is and how long the cord is (...30 feet long cord). Till I turn it on, I realize what a loud noise it gives out.My kitchen and bathrooms are covered by linoleum. I mop these area with swiffer on needed basis. It works so far so good. But I am eager to see how this Oreck Surface Scrub Hard Floor Cleaner works on linoleum surface.My first mistake is to use hot water in the clean bucket, the vacuum runs for short time and then stops. I fetch the menu out an read it carefully, then I realize this machine takes ""warm"" water, not ""hot"" water.  Well, my carpet cleaner has no issue taking hot water though. Anyhow, I have to wait for the water to cool down a bit.Like carpet cleaner, the first run is to dispense the water, then follows with two dry runs to suck back the dirty water. While operating it, I sense the water sucking effectiveness depends on how flat the surface is. For linoleum without too much pattern, this Hard Floor Cleaner works pretty well is sucking back the dirty water. But I suspect how effective it is on uneven surface, like tile floor with deep grout.Also, just like operating carpet cleaner, this Oreck Surface Scrub Hard Floor Cleaner need to be moved slowly in order for it to scrub the floor and then suck back the dirty water. So, the overall cleaning time is actually longer than using swiffer.Another thing to be noted, the vacuum-powered scrubbing wheels is not strong enough. I find myself using wet towel to scrub some stubborn spots.I don't expect one to use this Oreck Surface Scrub Hard Floor Cleaner to clean hard floor that often, just like the carpet cleaner is not used on weekly or monthly basis. Simply because it is quite a chore to use it. First, the floor need to be swept and vacuumed first. Then, need to spend long time (due to slow motion) to operate the Oreck Surface scrub cleaner. After that, the filters need to be cleaned before putting it aside.Final verdict, if you don't have big hard floor area to be cleaned, I would recommend to stick to swiffer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ6HVF63KREW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFMXWHW#wasThisHelpful","RJ6HVF63KREW4","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This LG 24GM77 24"" LED-backlit LCD monitor is great, but you need to play with the settings! Don't expect it to look just the way you want it after taking it out of the box. It takes me an hour of adjusting and testing to get my settings just right; but once I am finished I am very pleased. It is very bright the first time you turn it on (with the default settings). Be careful not to dim it too much or you will lose some of your color quality.This monitor is perfect for games that have a lot of movement as it keeps the image very clear when panning in a first person shooter for example. It virtually has no screen lag, and no ghosting or visual problem of any kind.  It also makes dark games look more clearer and vibrant, which is great for competitive multi-player matches that tends to have dark, hard-to-see areas.This LG 24GM77 does not have speaker. Not a big deal, just be aware about that. Most monitor's speakers are weak anyway. You can easily attach USB powered speakers as this monitor has 3 USB3 ports.This LG24GM77 comes with amazing # of hookups: 2 HDMI, 1 D-Sub, 1 DVI-D, 3 USB, 1 Display port. So, I can easily connect both my PC and game console to this monitor without the hassles of switching cables.Though the price of this monitor is on the high side, if you are a serious gamer, you won't be disappointed with this LG 24GM77 24"" LED-backlit LCD monitor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OBUHXCIRO2M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P0EOX1S#wasThisHelpful","R1OBUHXCIRO2M2","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The moment I open the box and find out this Miele Classic C1 Olympus Canister Vacuum does not have a motorized beater brush, I know right there this vacuum machine is not much usage on carpet.Also, do not get confused by the term of ""canister"". This is not a bag-less vacuum that you can just dump dust out of the canister. This Miele vacuum uses a special deigned bag. So, there is some on-going maintenance cost.However, it does work pretty well on hardwood floor and tile floor in my house (mainly first floor where there are no bed rooms). The low profile vacuum head allows me to get into tight areas under table, TV stand, or sofa. These are the areas where I tend to skip when using my up-right vacuum machine as they are hard to reach. The wheels roll on hardwood floor easily. So, I don't feel like dragging a heavy thing behind me when vacuuming. Nevertheless, the whole vacuum is pretty light also, only about 12 pounds.The retractable cord has a better design than another model I used before. Mainly because I can control the speed when retracting the cord. In one model I used before, the cord retracts so fast and the fast flying cord becomes a hazard by itself.Another big plus about this vacuum is the noise control. This is by far the quietest vacuum machine I have ever used.However, even if your main usage is for hardware floor or tile floor, I still has hard time to recommend this Miele Classic C1 vacuum. The $300+ price tag is just a little bit too high.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V3BEBHWBMTJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1AGGTK#wasThisHelpful","R2V3BEBHWBMTJ7","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Toshiba 2-in-1 Touchscreen laptop is pretty light and thin from laptop point of view, but heavy and thicker from tablet point of view. I don't think people can hold it as a tablet for long time. But, overall, it's still very portable and you can easily slide it into brief case, backpack...etc.Comparing with my Acer and Asus chromebooks, this Toshiba 2-in-1 laptop is faster for both (1) power up from cold, and (2) wake up from sleep. That's impressive. I guess the 128G SSD does help on the speed. The program loading speed is also fast.The battery is embedded and not replaceable. That's the trend for these kind of 2-in-1 laptops...as most tablets' batteries are not replaceable also. The battery life is about 4.5 hours on heavy usage. Nothing to brag about, as this is a compromise between portability and battery life.I like the keyboard design. To save keyboard real estate, some laptops/chromebooks remove some functional keys (for example, page-up and page-down keys). This Toshiba 2-in-1 laptop keeps most  functional keys. They just make some functional keys a little bit smaller to save real estate. I think that's a good design trade-off.Comparing with my other notebooks and chromebooks, I agree the hinge of this Toshiba L15W-B1120 Convertible laptop is not that firm. I don't mean any manufacturing defect. I mean the hinge has less friction to turn. So, it's less effort to rotate the screen to either laptop mode of tablet mode. When the screen and keyboard are opened with angle between 30 degrees to 330 degrees, the hinge has sufficient friction to keep the screen in firm position. I operate the laptop by keeping tapping the touch screen, the screen stays put. However, When the screen and keyboard are opened with angle less than 30 degrees or more than 330 degrees, the hinge does not have sufficient friction to keep the screen in position. The screen starts to drift down.In laptop mode, I don't see how people can work when screen and keyboard are opened with angle less than 30 degrees. So, that is not an issue. But, in tablet mode, it's possible to keep the screen and keyboard opened with angle at more than 330 degrees though. Not a big deal, but something to be aware about.All in all, comparing with my other notebooks and chromebooks, I like this Toshiba 2-in-1 touchscreen laptop for its fast response time (power-up, wake-up and program loading), its portability, and its flexibility in converting into a tablet. I take one point out as the hinge does not have sufficient resistance to keep screen in place when the screen is opened at angle more than 330 degrees.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25EXQFMPCTZ7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00REWQNXK#wasThisHelpful","R25EXQFMPCTZ7T","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am getting this TP-LINK Archer T8E AC1750 Dual Band wireless PCI card to upgrade an old desktop running window 7 for wifi connection.  I move the old desktop to the living room and use my 55 inch smart TV as the monitor. Mainly for kids to sing and dance with songs from some karaoke web sites. My smart TV does have wifi capability with quite some build-in apps, but I can do web surfing with my smart TV.After installing the card, I downloaded the latest driver from manufacturer's web site. The driver installed easily without problem. My router is in the study room, which is several walls away from my living room where my smart TV resides. With this card, I am getting full signal strength. Actually, the receiving quality with this TP-LINK PCI card is better than the receiving quality from smart TV's internal wireless connection. So, I end up also using the desktop computer to stream Netflix movies (not from my smart TV anymore).So far, I have been using this TP-LINK PCI wifi card for 3 weeks. It hasn't given me any problem yet.

"We purchase the whole rotisserie chicken from Costco for weekend meal on a regular basis. I usually use fork and knife to cut the chicken apart. Though doable but it's quite a chore, especially when I need to rotate or flip the whole chicken around for different cut angle. The fork and knife are just not quite the right tool for this task.The moment I see this Cuisinart claws, a spark light flashes through my brain right away. Yes, that's the exact tool I need to handle the whole rotisserie chicken :-)The handle is very easy to hold. The sharp claws grab the meat firmly. The metal construction is strong and I don't see it will give up on heavy lifting task. With this Cuisinart claws, I can easily flip or move around the whole chicken. I can break the whole chicken into small parts without even using knife at all. The small space between the claws make it very effective in stripping meat out of bones also.I also use it to break the pork rib instead of using knife and fork. What a relief for handling big meat.I would recommend this Cuisinart CMC-262 Claws if you have the need to handle meat, especially big meat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FV8FT2ALBDZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0GX6BU#wasThisHelpful","R2FV8FT2ALBDZ6","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two ways to configure this TL-WA860RE wifi range extender. Unfortunately, my TP-LINK N750 dualband router does not have the WPS (wi-fi protected setup) button. I can not take advantage of the auto-configuration approach. So, I have to choose the second method by manually entering my network password into this repeater.I wouldn't say the manual configuration is a fool-proof process, as it took me three iterations to finally enter network password into the repeater correctly. Once the password is in, the rest is pretty straight-forward....just plug the repeater to a power socket.If the repeater is too close to the router, it will show orange light. So, you just need to move the repeat far away from the router.My router is in study room, and I always get 1 or 2 bars when I use my Chromebook in kitchen. With this TL-WA860RE N300 wifi range extender in the kitchen, my Chromebooks shows 4 bars (the best signal quality).Some of my old gadgets in the living room does not have wireless capability. I am glad this TL-WA860RE N300 wifi rang extender has an ethernet port to provide wired connection option for those old gadgets.For speed testing, I stream HD video from a desktop PC to a notebook computer. I need to physically move the notebook computer to kitchen, so it connects to my home network through this wifi range extender, not through my router directly. I am impressed with the speed. The HD movie plays well, no pause, or slow motion.All in all, I am very pleased with this TL-WA860RE wifi range extender. The price of this range extender is close to the price of a low end router. However, the convenience of easily moving this range extender around the house is hard to beat. I would recommend this wifi range extender if there are signal receiving dead stops or weak spots in your house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25S7EH8B1K36B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEW7V7E#wasThisHelpful","R25S7EH8B1K36B","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Fintie kindle paperwhite smartshell cover for my kindle papwerwhite. I am getting this Belkin Folio for my wife's Kindle Voyage. I like the Fintie smartshell of my kindle paperwhite a lot,  I thought this Belkin Folio is similar to the smarshell cover. Well, I am somewhat disappointed for following reasons: (1) it feels so plastic and looks pretty cheap, (2) it does not have the auto wake/sleep function.However, from protection point of view, this Belkin folio is sufficient, the kindle voyage fits snug in this cover. Actually, after I put the kindle in, I could not get it out (I don't want to enforce it.). And the magnetic cover will not pop open by mistake. Also, the cover is very thing and light. So, it does not make kindle voyage bulky.My Fintie kindle paperwhite smartshell is only about half the price of this Belkin Folio.

"A local real estate club host interviews the author, Garret Sutton, on a radio show. This book is mentioned in the interview. I am hooked by the title of ""Loopholes"" of Real Estate, as I am active in learning tricks for tax saving. So, I go ahead and get a kindle version. After reading the whole book, I realize this book does not offer me any new tricks in saving tax from my real estate portfolio....don't get me wrong, this book does cover quite some tax saving techniques, but I know them already. However, to my surprise, this book has quite some asset protection related subjects. And I do learn quite a bit on this subject from this book....things like:1) What is a land trust? This book helps me to fully understand the purpose, the usage, the pro and con of a land trust.2) Why a California LLC is a weak LLC. Why Nevada LLC, or Wyomin LLC are strong LLCs.3) What are the homestead exemption differences in different states. And how the homestead exemption can protect asset.4) The difference between Grand deed and quit claim deed.5) Use mortgage to discourage lawsuit.6) Use line-of-credit on property to discourage lawsuit.I especially like Garret Sutton's approach in this book by using layman terms to cover subjects that could be hard to understand. Even better yet, quite some examples (or cases) are used to ensure readers fully understand each subject well.I have 10+ rental properties all under my own name. I have been using both personal umbrella and commercial umbrella policies as the shield for asset protection. This book really helps me to have a clear picture how to proceed from here to implement a better asset protection scheme.This book costs me less than 10 dollars. But what I got from it is far more than the book's cost. I highly recommend this book for real estate investors...whether they are looking for tax saving tips or for asset protection recommendations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SSRC6VWEOATO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E257UHU#wasThisHelpful","R1SSRC6VWEOATO","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the 1st time we use a professional class blender. It far out-performs our current white-brand consumer class blender from Walmart. The 1000 watts really gives out strong chopping power to quickly grind through ingredients. For testing purpose, we put ice cubes to see how it goes, which we never dare to do so with our cheap blender. Wow...this beast just chews up the ice cubes like cutting through cotton balls. In about 10 to 15 seconds, the ice cubes are turned into snow! Yes, like snow making machine used in the ski resorts.We also like how easy to remove the blades completely from the pitcher. It makes the afterward cleaning work so much easy now. With my old low-end blender, the blades is not removable from the pitcher. So, it takes some careful clean work to remove food stuck at the button of the pitcher while not to get cut by the blades.The Ninja's blade design allows it to handle large foods. So, we don't need to cut carrots to very small pieces before putting them into the blender. That's some effort saving here.We also like the control button design...especially the pulse mode. So, we can fine tune how fine the food need to be chopped.Overall, we are pleased with this 1000 Watt Ninjia blender. I would recommend it to my friends and relatives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZ5IDMPBCJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGV4506#wasThisHelpful","R1GZ5IDMPBCJE","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have some rental properties and I manage some fix-up and renovation work by myself without 3rd hand. From time to time, I run into situations that need another pair of hands to hold stuff for me. I have a portable working bench with vise. But the vise is too weak to hold heavy objects, or wide objects. And my portable bench wobbles.I am so glad to find this jawhorse from Amazon. Majority of the jawhorse are built with metal, only few non-load-bearing components are plastic. It is not only heavy duty, but also very heavy. But that's the good part, its weight helps to keep thing stable.The clamping mechanism is a smart design. I can use both hands to position the object and then use one feet to step on the pedal to clamp the object. And the clamping power is great.When not in use, this jawhouse can be folded down for easy transportation or storage as it really does not take up too much space.In summary, this is a great investment if you need to work on large objects that won't fit in the typical bench vise, or you need additional hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IFDT1G6ADELP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XRFQKW#wasThisHelpful","R1IFDT1G6ADELP","AHS6PX6H22WW1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHS6PX6H22WW1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bluetooth wireless speaker is a pretty mature product with plenty of products available in the market at various price range.This bluetooth speaker stands out well comparing with other bluetooth speakers from industrial design point of view. It is very small (a golf ball size when fully closed) and highly portable. The battery life is very good (18-hour run time on wired connection and 10-hour run time on wireless connection). The bluetooth connection is very easy to operate and very fast to get connected with other devices. The included RCA cord at the bottom of the speaker is convenient. It also has a built-in microphone. Frankly, all these features are better than my other bluetooth speakers.However, as a speaker, the quality of audio is one of the most essential selling point. Unfortunately, this speaker has a lousy audio performance. Not only base is virtually not there, the volume is so small. I guess the meaningful usage of this small speaker is when you want to share music from cell phone or mp3 player.

The 24 inch length is good, not too long that may require a bigger working space. If you get used to other softer rollers, you will feel a little pain on your muscle initially when using this roller.

When it is folded for storage, it really does not take up too much trunk space.This costco hand-truck/dolly has good construction quality for carry load up to 300 ponds. Yet, itself is not too heavy as some parts are built with plastic. Don't worry, the plastic parts are not in the area for carrying load. The folding and unfolding mechanisms are very easy to operate.I doubt this heavy-duty hand-truck/dolly would be an often-used item in normal households.

"I received a review copyThe power of social media! Author Cassandra Dunn and I found each other online via our love of the Vizsla breed â€“ we each own these Velcro dogs and bonded over ownership of the uniqueness of this breed. When Cassandra let me know her debut novel featured the loveable V, I immediately accepted her review offer.There is a lot more to this novel than the brief mentions of the Vizsla. We get the POV from several characters â€“ Lana, her two children, and her brother Matt. Lana is struggling through a divorce and raising her children, Byron is trying to find his own while in high school and entering the dating world, Abby struggles with an eating disorder and bullying, and Matt has Aspergerâ€™s, and has daily struggles in his life. I thought it was interesting that we got these multiple POVs, but it makes sense when you think about the title. Each character is adapting to something, and over the first few chapters, I began to warm to the pace. While I tend to lean towards the faster novels (a characteristic found in many chick lit books) I was soon into my reading groove.I am highly impressed this is a debut novel, as it was rich, compelling, and definitely tugged at the heartstrings. I loved the overall tone and message of the book, which is basically learning how to not only adapt to changes in your life, but to thrive along with them. And the Vizsla scenes didnâ€™t hurt either :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNE1N8NUL7IMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB3XO#wasThisHelpful","RNE1N8NUL7IMX","A23MYUKGYZZA8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23MYUKGYZZA8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a review copyThis was my second ever audio book selection, and it was fun to listen to as Jane Green is also our narrator! This book has a lot of serious subjects in here, as Cat is an alcoholic and struggles greatly in her life. While slightly slow in the beginning for me (and I honestly didnâ€™t really feel like the flashback to her mom and Brookâ€™s relationship was super necessary) it picked up for me once Cat learned of her father and her other family living in Nantucket. Then, it started to get really juicy, but just as abruptly, the story switches and we are fast-forwarded in time. That I didnâ€™t love, because then I felt like the pace of the story was once again slowed down as we met this new, older Cat, and understood what her past years had been like after the big incident that forced her to leave her new family behind in Nantucket. The ending is definitely a redemption story and I was rooting all along for Cat, though I do wish more of the story had been on solely her road to that redemption, to her making the amends, instead of all the backstory we got. It was a nice book to listen to on my long walks with the dog, and Iâ€™m sure Jane Green fans will enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6MCYS70RIN03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQWJ0E8#wasThisHelpful","R6MCYS70RIN03","A23MYUKGYZZA8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23MYUKGYZZA8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I absolutely live for books set in Paris and we got along as well as I expected us to :) A fabulous chick lit delight, I was transported to Paris along with Chloe and happily kept up with her life, her job, and her romance up and downs.

"I received a review copyThis is actually my first book from Stacey Wiedower but I sure hope it wonâ€™t be the last! From the beginning I got caught up in the story, and the heartbreak that is Amelia and Noahâ€™s relationship. Watching them try to make it without each other hurt my own heart, but I couldnâ€™t figure out how the heck the two would find each other again and if they would get their happy ending. I also loved the story of Amelia and having her best-selling book turned into a movie, plus her subsequent relationship with a famous actor. That was so much fun to read about! Overall, a super cute beach read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C2RHPX65GTL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7X2Q7K#wasThisHelpful","R3C2RHPX65GTL0","A23MYUKGYZZA8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23MYUKGYZZA8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a review copyTo start, I will say this was my very first audio book I have ever listened to. Since summer means walking the dog several times a day, I thought I needed to join the audio book trend and Iâ€™m sure happy I did. This was such a terrific book to listen to during my long walks, a story filled with struggles and triumphs, delicate family issues, and so much more. Where to start? I have read every book from Sarah Pekkanen and truly love her writing. I get excited when I see she has a new book out, and know I will be in for a terrific story. All true again here. This book deals with a white police officer shooting and killing a Hispanic teenager, but there really isnâ€™t a race issue at all in this book. What I think Pekkanen is focusing on is what effects a family, what effects a marriage, when something so huge and traumatic happens. Yes, we do get into the other issues, and we get both sides of the case, which I thought was great. But the parts that kept me on my toes were watching Jamie and Mike try to keep it together in the aftermath, watching the cracks appear in the once happy family façade, and waiting anxiously until the end to know how this story would play out. There are some fantastic subplots as well, including Mikeâ€™s ex-girlfriend and mother to his child and her role in all of it, which had me holding my breath at times. There was one particular scene where I started to cry, which you can image while walking down my street with my Vizsla at the end of the leash probably caused a funny scene if anyone was watching me. A powerful and gripping read, and one I highly recommend to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HCDRLG37OL4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1S3F4#wasThisHelpful","R1HCDRLG37OL4L","A23MYUKGYZZA8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23MYUKGYZZA8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a review copyI have read all the books in the Allison Campbell series, and I love them all! Tyson has a way of bringing you into the world and right in the center of the mystery. Dying Brand was no exception. I loved the short and snappy sections of the book, and it made the story seem to fly by. I couldnâ€™t put the book down, especially as I neared the end. There were so many possible suspects in the death of Allisonâ€™s ex-boyfriend, and I had trouble deciding who I thought was the real killer. Turns out, I really wasnâ€™t close at all!

"I received a review copyWhat a sweet read! This book was quick but filled with fun. Chase really did seem too good to be true, but he also came with his own unique set of baggage that we slowly learn about. The twist with Lucyâ€™s sister was really sad to read about, but added a lot of depth to the story. This was chick lit and womenâ€™s fiction wrapped into one, and was a delight to read.

"I received a review copyOh man, this is a true laugh out loud chick lit tale. I absolutely love how this is written, like Avery is talking right to us, and the beginning of each chapter starts with such a hoot. We have a classic heroine â€“ single after her husband finds someone younger, in peril with her job, an abysmal cook (I can relate to that, so that particular scene really stuck with me) and trying to move on and find a new Mr. Right.

"I received a review copyWhen reading this blurb, I knew without a doubt that I was going to love this book. I mean â€“ a pet psychic? Yes, please! That alone seriously had me hooked, but I knew I was going to get a fun and funny chick lit story from Tracie Banister as well. I wasnâ€™t wrong, folks â€“ I absolutely loved it! Laugh out loud funny and fast-paced, I followed twins Willa and Sloane without abandon along the way. I loved each character equally, and they are both so well-written and different, yet loveable. Okay, Sloane can be a little rough around the edges and Willa sometimes had her head in the clouds, but two very loveable sisters none the less. The pet psychic parts nearly had me in stitches (and I really wish I had one in this area to help me out with Aries!) and all the romances along the way were quite interesting! Just when I thought something was going down the predictable route â€“ wahbam! â€“ a new twist occurred.

"I received a review copyOoh, what a quick but intense read! The mystery starts off right away, and just climbs from there. Much like in Deadly Bloodlines, I wasnâ€™t sure who was behind everything, and the ending had me surprised. Just when you think everything is wrapped up â€“ it isnâ€™t. Remy was a great character to stand behind, a tough woman who isnâ€™t afraid to stand up for what she wants and believes in. This is especially the case when it comes to her love life, and I found that refreshing to read about.

"I received a review copyThis was a book that had me invested from the very beginning. I absolutely love books that flip between past and present. While we only got little clips from Kathleen Eaden on her past, they were full of knowledge and really tied the story together. Each competitor has their own unique story going on, and because this book was pretty thick (I received a hard cover) I knew from the beginning that we get pretty in depth with them, which was the case. Though I canâ€™t cook or bake myself I love reading foodie books, and delighted in the recipes given and the thorough baking guide throughout the way. Sometimes I did tend to mix up the characters since we were following so many, but I truly enjoyed this book as a whole.

"I received a review copyI say this in all my reviews for Nicky Wells â€“ I loved this book! What a fascinating concept this was. This book is definitely more on the mature side, as well, the book was basically all about sex! But it never got raunchy or on the erotica side of things, instead, it explored the relationship between the newly married Alex and Casey, and if indeed they were suffering from a curse that caused them not to be able to have sex. Some parts in here were kind of hysterical â€“ such as one time when they attempted sex and the bed broke, the roof caved in and the bathtub went through the floor. I was reading that scene while applying eye makeup (because I just canâ€™t not multi-task) and I had to take a break so I wouldnâ€™t smear eye liner everywhere because I was laughing so hard.

"I received a review copyReview:If you read my review of The Seeds of a Daisy, you know how excited I was to read the second book from Alison Caiola. And I was not disappointed. This book was very different from the first one, where it explored the relationship between mother and daughter. In this one, we watch Lily try to move with her life after losing her mother and becoming a mother. She is trying to also move on from Robbie, the man she loves but is on a medical mission in Africa, but she quickly learns he has been kidnapped, and the action really starts. This book got my heart beating fast, as we try to rescue Robbie from terrorists with Lily and the C.I.A. and Navy SEALs. I was not expecting this from book two, but it was really spectacular. I canâ€™t imagine the research that was put into this book, and I give major kudos to Caiola for writing such an adventure book.

"I received a review copyTo be honest, I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from this book when I first picked it up. The cover didnâ€™t necessarily draw me in or intrigue me, but this is a classic case of not judging a book by the cover. This is a fast-paced story that left me wanting to read book 2 from this series when itâ€™s ready. Irene is the typical college student â€“ trying to juggle guys, friends, money and family throughout her studies and student life. There is a lot going on in this book â€“ from serious family drama to domestic abuse â€“ but the book never felt too heavy or hard to read.

"I received a review copyOMG, my friends. I said it best on social media when I announced I was reading this book. I said â€œThis book is making me want to pause life so I can just keep reading.â€ I mean...do I even need to say anything else? From the first page, and Iâ€™m not lying, from the first page I knew I was going to be totally hooked. Anita Hughes is one of my favorite writers, and her books have the complete ability to make me get lost in them. I love that this time I was taken to France, and wrapped up in not only a mystery in the present, but from the past. I loved the dueling time periods we get, from Serena but then also Yvette, as she takes us back in time along with her. There was a twist near the end that Iâ€™ll be honest â€“ I didnâ€™t see coming. When a book makes me gasp aloud and my eyes bug out, you know itâ€™s a good one.

"For the eyeshadow, I actually went looking for the Bella line when I was shopping, and I guess they were too new for my Kmart to carry (or Kmart was going out of business and wasnâ€™t buying new products...thatâ€™s probably it). Looking on Milaniâ€™s website, I donâ€™t even see this eyeshadow listed, which Iâ€™m not sad for you because I didnâ€™t love it. It was a really light pink with sparkle in it, but when I put it on my lids, it basically was just like putting glitter on there. None of the pink shade really came through, and the only way to get any color was to load up on product and use a liquid like Mac Fix + to help give it a boost.

After reading the synopsis and my eyes catching on the â€œdarkly comic taleâ€ part, I was even more curious about what I would be reading. I am really glad the author added the word â€œdarklyâ€ because I probably would have been completely thrown off guard if not.

"I received a review copyDonâ€™t Mention the Rock Star was a quick read, thanks to the short and snappy sections, and to the point plot. We bounce around from Kellieâ€™s past and present, meeting the boy she dated back in the day, and learning about the man she married. This book was really interesting because it discusses the question of can we ever forget our first love, and the added twist in here is that Kellieâ€™s first love went on to become a successful rock star â€“ and now heâ€™s back on the scene. There are plenty of other twists and turns along the way, including one that really took me by surprise. Definitely thought-provoking â€“ give it a read!3.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HQLY5YRNJFV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9T92ME#wasThisHelpful","R1HQLY5YRNJFV2","A23MYUKGYZZA8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23MYUKGYZZA8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a review copyIf you follow my blog, you know that I love some magic in my books. Rubyâ€™s Letters delivers a little of everything: intriguing storyline, a dash of romance, a mystery, and ghosts! Because itâ€™s the way I roll, I think I liked the murder/mystery/ghosts the best while reading, but it was so fun to follow along and try to figure everything out â€“ including how the ending would come about. What I also really enjoyed was the humor breathed throughout the pages. A truly fun novel to read, and I highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R57FDHLQW4D1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ODFEWIY#wasThisHelpful","R57FDHLQW4D1N","A23MYUKGYZZA8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23MYUKGYZZA8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a review copyOoh, just like how I love my chick lit! New York Dolls was a quick read, filled with celebrities, fashion, a little romance and a lot of laughs. Denton was easy to get along with, and no one could blame her for getting swept up like she did. It was interesting to read her moral dilemmas as she got more and more involved with her new celebrity friends. The supporting characters were fun to read about as well â€“ Mr. John gave me a few giggles â€“ and the ending actually came with a little surprise, which I thoroughly enjoyed discovering that. Fun, fast, and fresh chick lit!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6EPCMWUWL94O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PGJ1S9M#wasThisHelpful","R6EPCMWUWL94O","A23MYUKGYZZA8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23MYUKGYZZA8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Don't own yet, but played last week in a group of 7.  Only one person had played before, but one practice round was enough to get us all up to speed on the rules.  Figuring out the strategies took longer, of course.  Game moves along quickly.  With 7 of us, the game took about 90 minutes to finish, and that time just flew by.Of the 6 of us who did not yet have the game, 5 of us are now buying it.  So, that should give some idea of how enjoyable it was.  You do need a flat surface to play, since you need to see what cards are face-up for each person, how much 'money' each person has, etc.  But, as a card game, it's very mobile...a perfect game to take on camping trips, on family vacations, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZ340QXUP8P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=158994030X#wasThisHelpful","R1DZ340QXUP8P2","A15V97Z3T4GE7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15V97Z3T4GE7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Only took about 45 seconds to get the rules.  Game (to 13 brains) took 5 minutes.  Game to 31 took about 15 minutes.  A perfect game to play when you want to do something quick.  Or, when you're waiting for more people to arrive (it's easy to join in a game late, although you probably won't win...you entering will not affect or effect the strategy of those already playing).Played it for the first time today, and it's a game I'll definitely be buying.Bonus for parents with kids at or below teen ages:  Although there is a high degree of luck in this game (due to, well, the sole action of rolling dice), it is, at its heart, a math game.  It's all statistics--will the benefit of doing another roll outweigh the possible risk of ""crapping out"" for that turn?  Since that calculation will largely depend on which of the various dice you have in your hand before each roll, it's a perfect opportunity to use statistics and probability theory in real-life and fun situations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C44Q7KRQWW2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003IKMR0U#wasThisHelpful","R3C44Q7KRQWW2G","A15V97Z3T4GE7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15V97Z3T4GE7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a bigot, it's hard for me to find books that advocate for and advance my position.  Especially books designed for little kids.  Thank God for this book.  Now, I can stimulate the creativity of my little children, while still installing in them important lessons.  Lessons like guns are good, health care is bad (at least if it comes from a Democrat president), and America is always right.  If there are any facts that don't support my positions, I would prefer to ignore them.  And if I can't ignore them, then I'd like to be able to shout them down.  And I want to teach my children the same lessons.  Without books like this one, we are in danger of raising a new generation of open-minded and tolerant adults . . . and it will be impossible to maintain our way of thinking if this happens.I'm looking forward to the next book in this series:  ""I am not a witch (but if I were, it would totally be okay to cast a spell and turn President Obama into a newt).""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M7XMEHOLH7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619530953#wasThisHelpful","R1M7XMEHOLH7C","A15V97Z3T4GE7F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15V97Z3T4GE7F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Unfortunate Decisions of Dahlia Moss is a delightful book!  I am not sure how I found it, as it isn't the type of book I would typically read, but I am really glad I read it.The protagonist of the story is, of course, Dahlia Moss, an unemployed millennial who been feeling dejected since her boyfriend dumped her for a dental hygienist.  The plot unfolds when Dahlia is hired to find a virtual weapon that was stolen from a player in an online game.  Dahlia then interacts with a series of characters in both the virtual and physical worlds, all of whom are wonderfully eccentric.  The story line twists and turns, and the reader is privy to Dahlia's impressions and thoughts.The Unfortunate Decisions of Dahlia Moss is fun, funny, well-written, and just a delight to read.

"I wear sunscreen every day, and it seems like I've tried just about every product made.  I've finally settled on using a daytime product for my face, neck and hands and a heavier, sweat resistant product when I work out or will be in strong sunlight.The La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 product has a lot of positive factors:1.  The consistency is light, almost watery, and it is not dry or thick.2.  It's easy to rub in, and your skin will absorb the sunscreen.3.  The scent is quite lightTo use, the sunscreen, first I applied a serum and moisturizer, and let those sink in. Then, I applied a layer of the La Roche-Posay Anthelios sunscreen to my face and neck, waited a few minutes for that to absorb, and then applied another full layer.  I then did a few other grooming items like brushing my teeth, etc. while the sunscreen finished sinking in.  I don't wear foundation or power, and found that the La Roche-Posay Anthelios could be a tiny bit shiny, but in a nice, glowing way.  The product did not leave any of the dreaded white shadow on my skin.I found that my eyes were really sensitive to the La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen, so I needed to wash my hands well before applying under eye concealer, and then be very careful to not smudge any into my eyes.  Even the tiniest amount stung, but if I was careful, it was fine.  The other concern was that sometimes I could literally taste the chemicals in the sunscreen -- I guess from breathing it in?  That was a temporary affect, and went away within an hour.All in all, this is a very nice but not perfect sunscreen.  (The perfect sunscreen hasn't been invented yet!) The product absorbs well, is moisturizing, and doesn't leave a white cast, which are three of the biggest negatives in sunscreens.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JFZOG548TG22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBJWP9K#wasThisHelpful","R3JFZOG548TG22","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a kid, but I do like the various Dummies books for kids as a fast introduction new technologies. Python for Kids is suitable for kids 9 or 10 and up, although they may occasionally need some help.My experience with Python for Kids is that the experience will be smoother on a Windows machine. My MacBook, which has the latest operating system, needed additional software to update the code editor. This turned out to be more trouble than it's worth, so I switched to my Windows 7 device, and everything was fine.The book is structured to be completed over four weeks. However, there are 10 projects, and I found it better to pace myself by project. A few projects are time consuming, so you should read and plan ahead a little.Python for Kids is a great choice for an introduction to Python or to programming.

The baking cup didn't stick to the cupcakes.These baking cups are sturdy and pretty enough to use them for things besides baking. They hold a serving of mixed nuts, and are cute with candy.

"How Software Works is not what I expected, which was a book about user interfaces, databases, applications, the internet, etc. A more accurate title for the book would be ""How Some Software Works"" or ""How Software Does Some Really Cool Things.""  The subtitle of the book tells you what the book is really about, which is encryption, computer generated imagery, game graphics, data compression, search, and concurrency.  All of these topics are quite interesting, and the book does a very good job explaining them.  However, I do think you need some understanding of computer science or mathematics to enjoy the book, versus working hard to understand it.I have rated this as four stars, but 3.5 would be better.

"The Past is a contemplative, slow paced story centered around four siblings vacationing at the family's summer home.  The house is old and falling to pieces, and as no one has the money or inclination to repair the house, the house will likely be sold.  This upcoming change to tradition adds a slight sense of poignancy to the story, but no one really talks about it much.Each sibling brings their hopes and problems with them -- loneliness, a new wife, a preoccupied husband, children,and quasi step children.  The story dances and sways between the different characters, and is filled with beautiful words that form a barrier between the story and the reader.  In the midst of the book, there is a sudden jump back in time to when their mother ran away from her husband and returned home to her parents.  This part of the plot gently trails off.The Past is exceptionally well written, and the writer's love of words is clear.

So, I was very interested to try the Lancaster Soft Creme Candy to see if they would fulfill my caramel craving without that dangerous stickiness.These candies are very soft and kind of squishy -- in an odd way, the texture is similar to a regular caramel but without the hard stickiness.  The flavor is light and true, and is not over whelmed with sweetness like some candy.The Lancaster Soft Creme Candy Vanilla and Caramel are a nice choice for fans of caramels and other non-chocolate candy.  I liked these enough that I also bought the Raspberry and Vanilla flavored candies, which are very good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231HXGK5FW6KC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8YLMW0#wasThisHelpful","R231HXGK5FW6KC","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Drowned Boy is a simple story of chilling, casual selfishness and cruelty.  Set in Norway, it features Inspector Skarre and the famed Inspector Sejer on a troubling case of a very young boy who drowned in a backyard pond.  The boy, who had Down's Syndrome, was the son of two very young parents -- a couple so young, the wife appears childlike, and they are dependent upon her father for their housing and jobs.An autopsy reveals that the young boy had soapy water in his lungs, so clearly did not drown in the pond.  Inspectors Skarre and Sejer, in a calm and methodical way, battle their own strong feelings about a dead baby and their intuitive view that everything is not quite right with the young couple.  The book begin to alternate with Inspector's Sejer's thoughts about the case, and a diary the young mother writes in daily to capture her feelings.  The reader discovers what happened the day the baby died before the police, and then enjoys a front row seat as the Inspectors have to deal with the young mother's epilepsy, the death of a key person, and Inspector Sejer's concern about his own health.The Drowned Boy is a quiet, simple story that engages the reader with a careful plot design that will have you questioning the thoughts of both the murderer and the police.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ0MDIFMUWAE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544483960#wasThisHelpful","RJ0MDIFMUWAE9","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think I am very good at artistic or crafty things, so I thought these Avery Kraft Brown Labels would be an easy thing to try.  The first thing you need to do is register for a free account at Avery.com. There is a link to a short how-to video on You Tube that is well worth watching to understand the basics.  You can select a stock design from Avery, modify an Avery design, or create your own.  Once you are satisfied with your design, you can save it online to Avery or to your hard drive.I chose a relatively simple flower design with a pretty script font that I personalized to say Happy Birthday. Be sure to save your design, as you can reuse it on other labels, or, if you are like me, you want to play around with several versions.  The challenging part of using the Avery software is printing, and you'll need to learn how your printer handles labels and/or card stock.  I printed on paper a few times for practice, and I still ruined two labels before I created an acceptable version.  My printer is not very new, so I suspect that a newer printer might do a better job.  Still, you need to be careful to get everything set up exactly perfect.You can create attractive labels for gifts, cookies, place settings, etc. with Avery labels and the online software.  You do need patience to get a professional looking outcome, so if I was creating labels for an important event, I would consider the option of having Avery print for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UTQCKTI2FSYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7VEMOA#wasThisHelpful","R3UTQCKTI2FSYR","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always searching for the perfect set of in-ear headphones, so I jumped at the chance to try these new Philips headphones.  For whatever reason, in-ear headphones just will not stay in my ears, I think it is because I have small ears and perhaps my ears have an off shape.  I've tried many different types and sizes -- small, large, foam, hard case, rubber tipped, and none of them work.The difference with the Philips in-ear headphones is that the tiny speaker is oval shaped, not round.  The headphones come with three different sized soft caps, I chose to use the smallest size.  To insert them in my ears, I actually stretch the opposite hand over my head, and that seems to get a good angle.  These headphones will stay in my ears through light activity -- so watching a TV show or listening to a podcast at my desk. They would not stay in for me while running, but if you normally don't have issues in-ear devices, they may be OK for you to use in more vigorous activities.I am not a sound expert at all, but for the average user, the sound is good.  There is not a lot of background noise, no funny noises when you move, and I found voices and music to be clear and true.  This still is not the perfect in-ear headphone, but it is very good and well worth the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B9TR3SVEVMWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3A0G50#wasThisHelpful","R2B9TR3SVEVMWZ","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a two year old cat who is always hungry! He's a big cat, both long and tall, and although he's not overweight, he would be if we let him eat what he wants. My other cat is a petite girl, and she is much less interested in food than her brother.  So, my boy cat eats every meal right on time, while the girl will wander down when she feels like it. This led to a lot of kitty anxiety, as my poor boy would be distraught that his sister was eating her lunch when his was long gone.The Wellness Natural cat treats have been a perfect solution. While my little girl cat daintily nibbles, I feed my big guy these treats.  He loves them, and has some fun with how crunchy they are. So, at the expense of a few extra calories, I can give him something healthy and keep him away from his sister's food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZFCYMYI4Z22N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IP05CRS#wasThisHelpful","R2ZFCYMYI4Z22N","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Murderer's Daughter introduces a Grace Blades, a flawed character that is equal parts empathy and vengeance.  Grace's parents were poor, neglectful addicts, leaving Grace to raise herself.  When her parents die (yes, Grace is truly a murderer's daughter), a social worker sees something special in Grace and goes out of his way to find a supportive foster home.  Grace flourishes in this home, where it is discovered that Grace has a very high IQ and is remarkably brilliant.  Eventually, Grace is adopted by a couple who understand her introverted nature and support the development of her intellect.As an adult, Grace becomes a psychologist who treats patients dealing with horrific life events and grief.  Grace has become very wealthy, and lives life on her own terms, which includes finding men in bars for casual sex.  One encounter turns out to be completely different than what Grace was looking for, and she is drawn into a game of psychological cat and mouse, with strands to tragic events in her childhood.  Grace's internal moral compass is somewhat outside the ordinary, and she takes justice into her own hands.As with all books by Jonathan Kellerman, The Murderer's Daughter is well written and engaging from beginning to end.  As a heroine, Grace reminds me of Kathleen Mallory, and anyone who enjoys the Mallory series will like The Murderer's Daughter.  I am eagerly waiting for the next installment in Grace's story!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25MBUBV8O7AD0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545311#wasThisHelpful","R25MBUBV8O7AD0","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I Regret Nothing is a light, fun, and enjoyable book.  For everyone who has read Jen Lancaster, you know a bit of what to expect--humor, honesty, sarcasm, and a healthy degree of self awareness. What I really enjoyed most about the book was the focus on ""what comes next?""  Jen, like many of us, has lived through her thirties, experienced some difficult times, and has enjoyed some success. So, she has done a lot of things, but not everything, so how do you choose what to do now? Like all of Ms. Lancaster's stories, what ensues is funny, not nape cessation deep, but always relatable. The only part of the book I did not enjoy was the scorn for other Americans vacationing in Rome. I'm sure there were plenty of polite Americans there as well, and it seems a bit mean to pick on this stereotype. (By the way, I travel globally, and people everywhere wear white sneakers, or now, neon colored ones--it's not just an American thing.)Overall, a fun summer read, and a book I enjoyed from an author I faithfully read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R321CZCUX4Y1SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4HH4#wasThisHelpful","R321CZCUX4Y1SH","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Part of the cap folds up to become a small, ring shaped handle.The only negative for me is that I have small hands, and I found the bottle a bit unwieldy and heavy to drink from.

"Kitchens of the Great Midwest uses two plot techniques to tell the story of Eva Thorvald, a woman with an exquisite palate.  The first technique is the story of Eva's life is told via the narrative of other people in her life--her father, her cousin, a boyfriend, a rival, her mother, etc.  The second technique through colorful, rich, loving descriptions of food.The story takes us from Eva as a small infant to a successful chef / business woman, running a series of exclusive and expensive popup dinners.  Eva's path is not always a smooth one, but throughout, her passion for food only increases.  She is a difficult woman to know, and as she becomes successful, Eva tends to hide herself away, surrounded by friends who defend her privacy.Kitchens of the Great Midwest is a wonderful choice for anyone who loves cooking, or food, or has an adventurous palate and likes to try new things.  Each chapter tells Eva's story from a different perspective, and I found these connections were too loose, and I had to go back into the story to try to figure out who some of the narrators were, and what their connection was with Eva.  For me, this unevenness took away from the plot and the story, and made it a bit difficult to really connect with Eva.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQGC8CIYA5BL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052542914X#wasThisHelpful","ROQGC8CIYA5BL","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using the Colgate Enamel Health Whitening Toothpaste for a few weeks, but I doubt that is long enough to experience all the benefits. I wish the package stated ""within X weeks"" or something similar!I use the Colgate Enamel Health Whitening Toothpaste with a Sonicare toothbrush once or twice a day. Simultaneously, I'm using Sensodyne as I usually brush my teeth three times a day. This Colgate paste has a mild mint taste, it's not overwhelming when you brush and the taste fades pretty quickly.

"The Woman Who Stole My Life tells the story of Stella Sweeney through a series of events at different points of her life.  There is the Stella who is married, with two children, and relatively content in her life.  There is also a Stella who is in Ireland, unhappy and evidently poor, worrying about her son and her ex-husband.  There is a very ill Stella, hospitalized for months with paralysis from Guillain-Barre syndrome.  Finally, there are glimpses of a different version of Stella, living in New York City and on a book tour across the US.The story brings us back and forth in Stella's life, using these different phases to explain how she ended up where she is, although it is not clear exactly where that is.  Along the way, Stella meets new people and finds friendship and love in unexpected places.  The Woman Who Stole My Life is primarily a love story--Stella's love for herself, her family, her friends, and a new romantic interest.Marian Keyes is one of my favorite authors, and I never miss one of her books.  The Woman Who Stole My Life is a good book, but it is slightly too long, and I did become a bit impatient a few times, wishing that it would pick up the pace to the point.

"Eeny Meeny is a dark, chilling, thriller with a fresh view and remarkable twist on an active and sometimes overworked genre.  Detective Inspector Helen Grace is fully committed to her career in the police force, working long hours, keeping herself fit, and avoiding the pitfalls of drinking or over familiarity.  DI Grace has been quickly promoted through the ranks, and is admired by many of the other female police officers, although they note that DI Grace doesn't have much of a life outside of work. Driven to excel, DI Grace has a troubled past and secrets, but she keeps to herself and no one guesses at her inner turmoil.DI Grace and her team are assigned to the case of particularly brutal and cruel serial killer, whose method of operation is to hold two people captive without food or water, but with a gun containing one bullet.  One of the two people must die, and the other can go free.  The ultimate betrayal is, of course, that no one really goes free, as the life of those who live is ruined.  This theme of betrayal runs throughout the book, as DI Grace identifies that someone on the police force is leaking details of the case, betraying the team.  In turn, she betrays her officers, accusing several of them of being the leak until she finally identifies the real culprit.  As the serial killer continues to murder victims and taunt the police, DI Grace finally finds what links the murders together in a horrifying discovery that threatens her career, her sanity, and her life.Eeny Meeny is a dark story, one where the reader sympathizes with a flawed leading character who is hiding many facets of herself.  The plot line of the serial killer is slick and frightening as it wends it way to a bloody conclusion, and the additional plot line of the police leaking information is smoothly linked back to the case.  The plot will capture your attention from start to finish, and I am looking forward to the US publication of the second book in this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3STRQV6TATC38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451475496#wasThisHelpful","R3STRQV6TATC38","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Murder of Magpies is a smart, funny, modern mystery story.  The primary character is Samantha â€œSamâ€ Clair, a mature woman who has met with some success a book editor in London.  Sam is relatively happy in her lifeâ€”she enjoys her career, is adept at office politics and managing her authors, she lives in a lovely apartment, and has a close relationship with her mother.When one of Samâ€™s favorite authors, and friend, writes an a tell all book that exposes money laundering, Sam faces the challenge of publishing the book while still ensuring her firm is not exposed to any legal risks.  When the author suddenly disappears, Sam realizes the risks are greater than she thoughtâ€”potentially life threatening.A Murder of Magpies unfolds with a series of characters, intrigues, clandestine meetings, and double crosses.  The money-laundering story line is a bit different, and very interesting.  One of my favorite characters is Samâ€™s mother, a razor sharp successful attorney who is willing to stretch some legal boundaries to help Sam.  Sam also discovers romance during the story, which is written in a realistic and tasteful way.Overall, a Murder of Magpies has a lot to offer.  The heroine is smart, pragmatic, romantic, and kind.  The scenarios she encounters are realistic, and the crimes are complex enough to require some thought by the reader.  Samâ€™s co-workers and friends are great additions to the story line, as is Samâ€™s mother.  I enjoyed that the strong plot with very minimal use of obscenities and violence.  Hopefully, this book is the first in a series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E6LGQTPJQ66T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MEDBDP2#wasThisHelpful","R2E6LGQTPJQ66T","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jane Green tends to write books that seem to be about women you know, or would like to meet.  In Summer Secrets, the woman is Cat, a recovering alcoholic who, after many relapses, is attempting to fix all the broken pieces of her life.From her very first drink, alcohol was Cat's friend.  A drink, or five, helped her achieve that elusive sense of belonging she desired.  Eventually, the norm became five or more drinks, with blackouts and severe hangovers a common occurrence. Tired of being hungover and embarrassed, and pressured by her friends, Cat attempts to quit drinking--time after time.  She even starts a relationship with another alcoholic in recovery, but her stealth drinking is just another example of her inability to stop.When Cat discovers shattering news about her parents, so many things become clear to her, and she begins to understand her troubled relationship with her father. Given a chance to connect with a family she had not known she had, Cat does what she always does--ruins it with bad behavior during a drunken binge.Fast forward a few years, and Cat is finally sober, divorced, and a single mother.  She begins trying to make amends, but discovers it is not always quite so easy, and that hurt and bruised feelings can last for many years.  Of course, many things do work out for Cat, and she begins to see hope in fixing some, if not all, of the relationships she treasures the most.The story of Summer Secrets is told from the perspective of Cat, the recovering alcoholic, making the book one-sided and a bit difficult to connect with in some places.  Much of Cat's behavior when drinking was omitted or glossed over in an attempt to get the reader to champion Cat's attempt to make amends.  For me, it did the opposite, as it didn't seem Cat realized, or truly regretted, the hurt and harm she had inflicted on those around her.  Summer Secrets is an OK, enjoyable read, but a few too many steps away from the reality of what having someone with alcoholism in your life to meet its potential.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4M185MNXGKO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125004734X#wasThisHelpful","R4M185MNXGKO2","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I'm aware that Debbie Macomber is a best selling author, I've never read one of her books until now. I did not know what to expect, and the best way I would describe the book is that it is a romance novel with substance.First, there is a plucky heroine, Cassie, who has paid dearly for her youthful mistakes and is now a financially struggling single mother.  Cassie meets a potential love interest, Steve, at Habitat for Humanity.  Steve is, of course, a nice guy with a good job, but suffering still from the deth of his wife. Cassie and Steve start off by getting on each others nerves, but we all know they are denying the attraction they feel. To add more tension to the story, Cassie is contacted by one of her two estranged sisters, and the three women slowly renew their bonds.Last One Home is a nice story--it's sweet, there are happy endings, and it is well written.

"I like to read memoirs, and my favorite sub-genres include medicine, psychiatry, and hospitals. The Real Doctor Will See You Shortly is a fine addition to the many books written about physicians starting their careers.Dr. McCarthy brings a fresh perspective, firstly because he is both very smart and very personable.  I usually assume most doctors are smart, but not all doctors are humble or possess empathy. Dr. McCarthy is very open about his challenges in learning to relate to all types of patients, and how hard he had to work to keep his mind centered on the present. It was a delight to read as he developed both his technical and interpersonal skills, and I felt that I was learning new things about how some doctors think.As many of us know, medical residencies are brutal, with long hours, challenging work, learning, and the stress from fearing mistakes. Dr. McCarthy portrays his residency with grace, highlighting how it formed him as a doctor, but not shying away from his fears and insecurities. When Dr. McCarthy must deal with a potentially life threatening disease, his words express express his anxiety and hope, paralleled with how this helped him relate to his patients but without any condescension or assumptions.I enjoyed The Real Doctor Will See You Now, it is both a great memoir and insight into the brain and heart of a physician. I hope the Dr. McCarthy has one or more follow up books as his career progresses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27DKSO9Y3AHS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804138656#wasThisHelpful","R27DKSO9Y3AHS4","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I drink two or three large cups of coffee everyday, and I almost always use a flavored creamer or get a flavored latte at Starbucks.  However, I don't always feel like drinking hot coffee in the summer, and I lack the motivation to make iced coffee at home.  More importantly, I go to the gym for a 6:00 am working most days, and at the end of my session, I am hot, thirsty, and really wanting coffee!So, I tried the Skinny Cow Creamy Iced Coffee Drink by bringing them to the gym.  These aren't something I would drink while working out, but they were perfect for immediately after.  The size is perfect--small enough to take with you, but large enough to quench your initial first.  To me, the chocolate taste was stronger than the coffee, but that might be a personal preference.  The drinks are a bit sweet, so if I was at home, I'd probably use ice to dilute them a bit.  All in all -- I like the taste, the 120 calories, the natural ingredients, and the convenience, so a win.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDR2JLPYWIDH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S79RMPC#wasThisHelpful","RDR2JLPYWIDH1","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a Clarisonic Mia brush for more than two years, and although I like it, I've read that the Clarisonic brush can be too harsh.  So, I was interested to try the Philips PureRadiance brush.  First, the differences:1.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has two speeds, one is gentle and the other is a more intense option.  This is a good feature, as in the winter when my skin is dry, a gentler speed is better for my skin.2.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has rotating bristles plus an pulsing feeling.  The brush head is smaller than Clarisonic, so it is easy to use in small areas such as between your nose and mouth.3.  Similar to the Philips toothbrush, the PureRadiance brush has three timed sessions of 20 seconds each for three zones of your face.  This is beneficial if you have a tendency to over scrub or irritate your skin.4.  The PureRadiance brush is smaller and lighter than the Clarisonic.The PureRadiance is a different experience from the Clarisonic.  It's not bad, just different.  If this is your first facial brush, I think you will like the PureRadiance quite a bit.  If you currently use a different brush, you'll need to compare features.  If a gentle, light, easy to use brush is what you want, the Philips PureRadiance is a nice choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12BUCVPOLGK3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NL5JW6E#wasThisHelpful","R12BUCVPOLGK3P","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was unable to chew gum for about six months (due to an accident that injured my face and jaw), so I was happy to have the opportunity to try this Juicy Fruit Starburst Strawberry gum.  What I like about the gum:1.  The taste is strawberry or strawberry and cream, pleasant without being too sweet.2.  The flavor lasts for an acceptable amount of time.  (No gum has flavor that last long enough!)3.  When the flavor starts to fade, the gum is still a pleasant, mild version of the initial taste with no off flavors4.  The texture of the gum is the right mix of soft and elastic, and the gum didn't get tough or an odd texture over timeMy husband and I both enjoy the gum, which is remarkable as we usually have different tastes.  I am a big fan of non-chocolate candy, but with my jaw injury, I don't know if I'll ever be able to eat Starburst candy again, so finding the gum was fun for me.  The only disappointment?

"Sam Dryden was living a quiet life, working on remodeling houses to sell and slowly easing into a social life when he receives a call from Claire Dunham, an old friend.  Claire is one of the few people Sam trusts implicitly, and her message is brief and clear--Sam needs to leave his house immediately, and come meet her.This single phone call draws Sam into a tense and bizarre situation where the ""bad guys"" always seem to be one step ahead, and Sam is forced to believe the unbelievable. It is difficult to review this book without any spoilers!  It is full of action, suspense, chasing, hiding, smart solutions, and a bit of science fiction.  I don't usually care for the type of bizarre science fiction this story contains, but it is well written, and handled in a scientific way instead of just being a plot technique to allow the writer to do crazy things.Overall, if you enjoy suspense, mysteries, lots of actions, and a bit of a thinking story, you'll want to read Signal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AHM55VDLKHW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250030781#wasThisHelpful","R2AHM55VDLKHW4","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dangerous When Wet is an entertaining memoir which, despite being very revealing, still skitters lightly over some emotional minefields.  The positives about this book is Mr. Brickhouse is a very good writer, and his sheer enjoyment of his life in New York is a pleasure to read.  The reader doesn't need to agree with Mr. Brickhouse's lifestyle to appreciate how he throws himself into love, casual sex, work, and alcohol.Parts of Dangerous When Wet focus on Mr. Brickhouse's relationship with his mother, a strong woman who included her young deeply into all parts of her life.  Young Jamie loved his mother, and wanting never to disappoint her, struggled with revealing his homosexuality.  In adulthood, as his addictions spun his life out of control, his relationship with his mother shifted but never achieves complete honesty.The cover blurb saying Dangerous When Wet is ""blistering funny"" does the book a disservice.  This memoir is not funny, but is amusing and touching as the author shares his, and his family's, frailties.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Q9ON44H8253/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250041155#wasThisHelpful","R22Q9ON44H8253","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I have pasta for dinner once or twice every week. We've tried many different brands and varieties, especially looking for versions that would be more nutritious than regular pasta. Some of the pastas we tried were not very good; usually gluey or too chewy. We prepared this Barilla Veggie pasta with our home made red sauce, and it tasted like regular pasta.

"The Art of Baking Blind is a warm and gentle novel, one that will leave readers with a happy glow. The story centers around a baking contest sponsored by a grocery chain, with five amateur bakers competing. The competition is nothing like the brawls of reality television, but rather a genteel match between very different people.One of the most important characters in the story, Mrs Katleen Eaden, participates in the story only from excerpts from her famous 1966 cookbook, The Art of Baking. Mrs Eaden, who has recently died, was married to a supermarket magnate, and the baking contest is to find the ""next"" Mrs. Eaden.  The contest will be judged, and there will be You Tube videos of the winners of each round.The baking contest brings together five very different people, who find themselves baking in Mrs. Eaden's country home. There is a middle-aged housewife dealing with an empty nest, a perfectly turned-out and poised wife terrorized by her past, a naive single young mother determined to build a future for her daughter, a widower with two children just beginning to come back to life, and a young mother who has abandoned her career to focus on raising her son. Although these contestants have little in common, they begin to bond over their love of baking and desire to accomplish something.Of course, the baking and baking contests are metaphors for love--love for your children, spouses, parents, but also self love. The Art of Baking Blind is great choice for readers interested in a warm and uplifting book. You don't need to know how to bake to be enthralled by the thought and effort the contestants put into making their beautiful creations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHFGI7V312LR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250059402#wasThisHelpful","R2MHFGI7V312LR","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Monday's Lie is an exceptional book written entirely from the viewpoint of one character, Dee Aldrich.  Dee is the epitome of normal--she's married to her college sweetheart, they both of enjoyable jobs, live in a nice house, and are considering starting a family.  Close to her mother and brother, Dee is happy to have her terminally ill mother spend her final days in Dee's home.Then, small cracks appear in Dee's marriage, starting with their difficulties in starting a family are because Dee is taking birth control pills.  Dee's ambivalence about having a baby is partly explained by Dee's own child hood, when her mother was a secret agent who disappeared for work reason's, one time for months.Dee's suspicions of her husband lead her to investigate him, and then to dig more deeply into her mother's past, longing for a deeper understanding.  Monday's Lie has the reader inside Dee's head every step of the way, as the story unfolds in surprising ways.I enjoyed Monday's Lie because we get to know and understand Dee's flaws and her braveness.  The plot moves at its own pace, sometimes almost real time, and then flying through incredible situations.  This is a must read for anyone that enjoys books with strong female protagonists, darker plots, and brutal surprises.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley, the opinions in this review are my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q5AP2C81MRSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OOW0#wasThisHelpful","R2Q5AP2C81MRSJ","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost Dead is the fifth book in the series featuring Lizzie Gardner, a private investigator.  This series tends to be a bit gritty and dark, and Almost Dead continues in that vein.  Lizzie is depressed and reeling from a violent gun attack at her wedding, which has left her fiancÃ© on life support.  Unable to process everything happening in her life, Lizzie returns to work but is living with two of her co-workers / friends to avoid going home.Almost Dead has multiple plot lines.  Lizzie is engaged to find who is targeting the members of an elite, bullying high school club--years after graduation.  This case sets Lizzie up with a worthy protagonist, drawing a parallel to Lizzie's own desire to lash out at anyone who has hurt her.  At the same time, Lizzie feels watched or stalked, but can't imagine who would be motivated to do so.The case, Lizzie's personal concerns with her fiancÃ©e and a potential stalker, her living arrangements, and concerns about her co-workers all add up to a book that almost collapses under the weight of all the plot lines.  Although the ending brings everything together, and sets the stage for what Lizzie chooses to do next, I think this could have still been done with a somewhat simpler plot.As typical with this series, the book ends with a slight cliff hanger, and I think how T.R. Rogan approaches the next phase of Lizzie's life will make a tremendous difference to how the remainder of the series unfolds.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book from Netgalley for a review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QAY9XU8FG1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MV9GT26#wasThisHelpful","R3QAY9XU8FG1N","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"She Has Your Eyes is a pleasant, enjoyable book that leaves the reader with a warm feeling.  For me, the book is primarily about families and love, and that these both exist in various forms.Firstly, this is the story of a marriage. Andi and David are together, happily ensconced in her house, married in every way except the actual marriage.  Why?  Well, part of the reason is Andi's first husband died very young, and she has some residual reserve about marrying again.  Andi's adult life is also colored by a cool, remote relationship with her mother.  However, Andi and David are clearly a close and loving couple, and the reader can't help but to think things will work out for them.Then, of course, life happens.  David is surprised to find he's the biological father of a teen-aged daughter, one who seeks him out and simply appears at his home.  His daughter comes encumbered with teen-aged angst, a happy family reeling from her desire to find her father, and an apparently jealous biological mother.  While trying to figure out what this daughter means, Andi is emotionally tempted by an ex-boyfriend, one of ""the ones who got away.""  In the midst of this, Andi's mother suddenly has a need for Andi's time and attention, and Andi is grappling with all types of different feelings.I've said She Has Your Eyes is a bit of a love story because we see Andi and David's love face challenges, we read of how they develop a love for a girl they didn't even know existed, and how their definition of family grew to include David's daughter and the new relationship between Andi and her Mom.  The plot line with the ex-boyfriend was a little slow, but well used to show Andi's confidence become more stable and help Andi face the new challenges in her life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQUI0209F8DFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477848126#wasThisHelpful","RQUI0209F8DFS","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Memoirs are one of my favorite genres, and I read a fair number of them.  Gone in a Heartbeat was a surprise for me, as it is a rather unique memoir.  By his own admission, Dr. Neil Spector had an easy early life, continuing through college and medical school.  He loved treating patients, but also was energized by doing research that could lead to cures or at least the relief of symptoms.  Challenges entered his life when he and his wife lose two unborn children and Dr. Spector's experienced serious and mysterious health issues.The book blurb focuses on how Dr. Spector felt dismissed and discounted by the medical teams treating him, and that it wasn't until Dr. Spector was able to self diagnose that he received the treatment he needed.  This was interesting, and unfortunately, the rest of us without medical degrees don't have this ability.  I think that anyone who has struggled with balancing what doctors are telling you versus your body will be able to relate, and find some odd comfort that even doctors experience this from their peers!However, I think the blurb leaves out some of the best parts of the book.  Dr. Spector is also a poet, and includes some of his poems in the book. I am no judge of poetry, but I enjoyed this aspect as it showed another side of this smart, driven, but very ill man.Dr. Spector receives a heart transplant (this is not a spoiler, it is in the early pages of the book), and I found his writing about this experience to be exceptional.  He is able to bring together his medical knowledge, his own terror and frustration with his health, and empathy for the person whose organ donation allowed Dr. Spector to live.I would recommend Gone in a Heartbeat to anyone who likes memoirs, medical books, or who is open to a somewhat different reading experience.Disclosure:  I received a free copy of this book from Netgalley, and the opinion is the review is my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQE7NKE1LAI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936946424#wasThisHelpful","R2IQE7NKE1LAI6","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wore this lipstick off and on for about two weeks, to give it a fair trial.  The best I can describe it is that it is a light lipstick.  It's not shinny or sticky like a gloss, it is not sheer, but the coverage is lighter than a regular lipstick.  I found that is lasts for just an hour or two, but that might also because I didn't use lip primer or anything underneath the lipstick.Unlike many other lipsticks, this has a pleasant smell and taste.  I'm not quite sure if it tastes similar to anything in particular, but it is quite inoffensive.  I like the color of the case a lot, it is a pearly, pink-purple that stands out in your cosmetic case.I received petal pink to try, which I don't think worked with my dark hair and eyes.

"Run Holly Run is a wild book, mixing family, friends, community, ghosts, paranormal activities, and accolades to some previous classics.  The book is wild in the sense that there is always something happening, and Holly is always on the move.The story starts with Holly and her parents temporarily moving into a house touched by tragedy where there are mysterious happenings, and something isn't quite right.  Holly is fortunate that one of her friends from school lives nearby, and together they discover that many of the townspeople are behaving strangely, and others are missing.  Even some of the animals are acting out!The reader has glimpses of what is going on, and so remain slightly ahead of Holly.  The book goes on to mix in ghosts, spaceships, evil people, crop circles and types of crazy things, including sly references to Alice in Wonderland, 1984, and perhaps Close Encounters!Run Holly Run is fine for older children, there are a number of characters to keep straight and some of situations may be to scary or confusing.  However, this also makes the book more interesting to older teens.Overall, a fun book with some new experiences.

"Someone to Watch Over Me is a wonderful thriller that will keep the reader engaged from beginning to end.  The characters, the setting, the plot, and even the weather all come together in a suspenseful, well-written story with neatly handled sharp plot turns.The setting for Someone to Watch Over Me is Iceland, shortly after the financial crash.  People are stunned at the sudden financial changes, jobs are scarce, prices are rising, and there doesn't seem to be any relief in sight.  Being Iceland, it's also cold, snowy, and icy.  In this tense atmosphere, Thora Gudmundsdottir, an attorney, is hired by a convicted criminal to try to prove the innocence of another young man who has been convicted of setting a fire in a group medical home that killed several people.  This young man also has Down's syndrome, thrusting Thora into the world of care and rehabilitation for young people with mental or physical disabilities, including those who are also convicted of crimes.As Thora proceeds with the case, she finds a variety of half-truths, cover-ups, and lies.  Interspersed throughout the book are chapters about a young wife, recovering from a tragedy, who believes her home and her garden are haunted. This part of the plot is presented in an eery way, and it's difficult to see how the story will all fit together, but it finally does.Thora progresses with her research, taunted by provocative texts and hostile witnesses.  At home, her parents are in financial ruins and have temporarily moved into her garage, and Thora's boyfriend is struggling to find. work.  Ms. Siguradottir has been able to find exactly the right mix of work on the case, Thora's office, her personal life, and the environment in Iceland to create balance and atmosphere.I've enjoyed the other Thora Gudemundsdottir novels, but found Someone to Watch Over Me to the best yet, and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTM6RHRCDCCAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250051479#wasThisHelpful","RTM6RHRCDCCAA","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are no single right (or wrong) way for companies to innovate, the only answer to the question ""What is the best way for a company to innovate?"" is, it depends!  Sometimes, organizations are innovating with a view to the far future, which we see for example in pharmaceuticals, chips, and cellular research.  Other times, companies are looking for good innovations that they can execute now.  The Innovator's Hypothesis is for these times, when you are looking to quickly assess, implement, or move on.The fundamental theory of the book is called the 5X5 X-team approach--give a diverse team of 5 people no more than 5 days to come up with 5 business experiments that cost $5000 or less each and can be done in 5 weeks.  The approach is fast, inexpensive, and low risk.  Assuming a company tried all 5 experiments, their cost would be $5000 and people's time.  Equally important, the 5X5 approach avoids the big, strategic ideas that cost a lot of time and money, and by the time they fail, no one remembers whose idea it was.  OK, that may be an exaggeration, but an innovation that requires 5 years will grow and change, while in 5 weeks you are likely to stay on course.I like the 5X5 approach for several reasons--I believe it will appeal to many people who are eager to make an impact, allowing for 5 ideas per team gives enough space for risk taking, and it avoids the huge, strategic, bet-the-company ideas that never get done.  There is risk to the approach in that not all members of management will be comfortable with fast experiments, and organizations trying out the 5X5 approach need to ensure the experiments, at least initially, are supported by receptive parts of the organization.The Innovator's Hypothesis is a must read for anyone involved in innovation, if only because you can never have too many good ideas about how to innovate.  This low risk, low cost model can be tried by any size company so at minimum can be viewed as nothing to lose, but strategically, can help to break the pattern of big, expensive, strategic, warm and fluffy ideas.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3FXU1C21CCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262028360#wasThisHelpful","R2F3FXU1C21CCC","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these as a gift (so it doesn't show as an Amazon verified purchase) and am very happy with them!  My wrapping skills aren't very good, but I've been trying to improve the attractiveness of the gifts I wrap.  I recently decided part of the problem was I don't have the right tools!  These scissors make it much easier to cut wrapping paper in a straight line, and to cleanly trim off some of the excess bits of paper.  It is a small thing, but well worth the relatively low cost to make wrapping easier to do and easier to make attractive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJC4YH3Y5ZNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042SHF7C#wasThisHelpful","R1WJC4YH3Y5ZNU","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cap Hangup Organizer is a simple, ingenious device!  My husband and I each have several baseball type caps--I always wear one when I run, and he has both cold and warm weather versions.  Usually, we store our caps in various places around the house.  Some are on a hook in my closet, and I'm embarrassed to admit I hang the cap I wear most often on my bathroom door.  My husband keeps some in the front closet, one or two in the garage, and one or two in the vanity in the guest bathroom.  I never really thought much about organizing the caps, and just accepted the one on my door knob as the price for ensuring I did not forget to wear it.The Master Craft Camo Cap Hangup Organizer is brilliant in its simplicity.  It's a stiff fabric back, with a series of hooks made from velcro, with a metal hook on the top.  I was able to put all of the caps we wear most often on the organizer in just a few minutes, and then hung the entire thing on a hook in the coat closet.  It works perfectly--the velcro hooks are easy to use, the organizer doesn't take up much room, and our caps are hung up near our coats, which will hopefully remind us to wear them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342UIT8B8QXNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPZHVN4#wasThisHelpful","R342UIT8B8QXNB","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"She's Leaving Home is a British police procedural set in London in the 1960s.  The Beatles are hugely popular, unrest about the Vietnam war is increasing. young people are rejecting the perceived constraints and hypocrisy of their parents, and everyone seems to be rushing towards change.  ""Paddy"" Breen is a policeman, struggling with the impact of the recent death of his father, an out of touch boss, and Paddy's overwhelming unpopularity amongst his colleagues.The primary plot is the murder of a young girl, her body found abandoned on a trash heap.  Paddy is partnered with a woman trainee, which in the early 1960s, is shocking--she's not allowed to drive the police car, is assumed to have loose morals, and in general, is viewed as competent to make tea, and not much else.  Searching for the girl's killer leads Breen and Tozer (his female partner) into the world of bankrupt rich people, art dealers, and the civil war in Biafra.As the case to find the girl's killer evolves, the reader is immersed in corrupt and incompetent police work, racial slurs and prejudice, and the scorn for women that existed in the early 1960s.  Paddy learns more about himself, and his parents, and eventually finds comfort in becoming more open to some of the positives these new times offers.She's Leaving Home is a first rate police procedural, filled with a complex plot, colorful background, interesting sub-themes, and multidimensional characters.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in police procedurals, British crime, or fiction set in the 1960s, and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series which is to be released in early 2015.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ZZQNCWBSP41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO7FL10#wasThisHelpful","R14ZZQNCWBSP41","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lane Changes is the first in a (potential) series written by a new author, S.L. Ellis.  The book is an engaging story, with a promising set up that will give the author plenty of characters and situations to write about in future installments.  The main protagonist is Cassie Cruise, a former private investigator in her forties who has moved to a Florida neighborhood where most of the inhabitants are senior citizens.  Her best friend in the neighborhood, Janice, is a senior citizen who has recently sold Cassie a tattoo shop due to a mysterious illness Janice has refused to name.  So, a neighborhood full of retired people plus a tattoo shop offers a wide variety of characters and scenarios.In Lane Changes, a young woman named Lane has also moved into the neighborhood, and this is where the trouble starts.  Lane hires Cassie to find Lane's birth father, which draws Cassie deeply into a wider story of betrayals, abuse, and family conflicts.  Cassie's near inability to control her nosiness and need to ""not let people get away with things"" keeps her involved in the case even after everyone involved and her friends try to divert her.The strong parts of Lane Changes are that there is an opinionated heroine who isn't perfect but is aware of her flaws.  The surrounding characters, particularly her friend Janice and other people in the tattoo shop add variety and interesting sub-plots.  Cassie's romantic life is turbulent enough to also play a strong supporting role in the story.  However, the story is also overly complex, with too many stories thrown in, and as a consequence, becomes confusing and a bit contrived.Lane Changes is a worthwhile book for fans of women sleuths, especially anyone looking for some fresh ideas in the genre.  It's not a perfect book, but it's a very good initial effort from an author who shows promise.  I'll be looking for the second book in the series to see if the writing has tightened up a bit, and if it has, I believe this can become a successful series.Disclosure:  I received a free copy of this book from NetGally in exchange for a review; the opinions in this review are my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20O8G2PHQ0RF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKQY5BI#wasThisHelpful","R20O8G2PHQ0RF2","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The objective Dear Investor, What the Hell are You Doing? is not to tell you how to invest or details how to build a portfolio, but focuses on the things an average investor should not do.  For me, the first thing you should do when reading a book with financial advice is to research the author and try to understand their perspective and biases.  Ken Weber is the owner of Weber Asset Management, a boutique investment advisory firm that specializes in creating portfolios of Fidelity mutual funds.  So far, so good--Ken Weber has many years of successful investment experience, and as Weber Asset Management is a boutique firm, the book is not a blatant commercial.Much of the book is common sense that all investors should know.  Have reasonable expectations, understand your own biases, don't fall for the hot stocks and quick wins, don't chase performance or make emotional decisions.  I particularly liked Chapter 5 on planning, which points out the advice telling you to start saving early is only partially correct.  For example, even starting saving at 25 years of age, you need to ensure you are saving to reach an inflation adjusted goal (or, $1 million isn't what it used to be).The book is divided into six parts: Getting on Track; Eyes Wide Open; Stocks, Bonds and Common Sense; Are You Getting the Right Advice; Beyond the Stock Market; and The Path Ahead.  Each part covers a myriad of bad ideas, poor advice, and misunderstandings that you need to avoid.However, I disagree with some advice in the final part.  It starts off fine, advising no load mutual funds over individual stocks for most investors.  In the sections about index and Exchange Traded Funds, the author states that index funds are ""un-American"" because they target mediocrity or are average while a well-managed fund can deliver better than average returns.  It is correct that a well-managed fund can deliver better than average returns, but historically, many of them have not.  It is entirely possible that Weber Asset Management can actively manage a portfolio funds that outperform the average, but many investors do not have access to this type of individualized advice.  The intent of investing is to make your money work hard for you, not to beat a benchmark or demonstrate American spirit and pride.  The book would have been better served pointing out that no one approach, portfolio, or type of investment is perfect, and managed funds should be considered as part of your diversification strategy.I would recommend Dear Investor, What the HELL are You Doing? to anyone interested in investing and how professionals in the financial industry thing.  Reading all the things investors should not do in one book is refreshing, and a powerful message.  Investors shouldn't expect to rely on any single source for information, but seek out multiple (including opposing views) to better understand their choices.  Dear Investor... is a good source that deserves a place on the investors bookshelf.Disclosure:  I received a free copy of this e-book from NetGalley, and the opinions in this review are my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIOP4TE637OQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626341613#wasThisHelpful","RIOP4TE637OQJ","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may be ""just"" a pencil sharpener, but it's actually pretty cool. I use a lot of colored pencils for taking and marking up notes, as well as using regular black pencils for diagramming. Between traveling to different offices, open seating plans, and working at home, it's become very difficult to find a decent pencil sharpener. I have a few of the simple ones that are cone shaped with a blade, but as we don't have individual trash cans in our open offices, there isn't anywhere close to discard the shavings. So, the first good thing about the Bostitich sharpener is that it holds the shavings in a small plastic case. It's only large enough for a few sharpenings, but that's OK.  The case is a smooth oval shape, and it's easy to hold and twist to sharpen the pencil.The interesting feature is that you can choose a pointed or blunt finish for the pencil, which I really like and immediately sharpened my pencils to a blunt tip--no more breaking tips in my bag or when writing!I appreciate this relatively simple and ordinary device far more than I ever expected. It's nice when something you use all the time does its job superlatively, and the Bostitich sharpener is a great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NM7Q8AMFOMVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDVE9UA#wasThisHelpful","R3NM7Q8AMFOMVD","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clothes, Clothes, Clothes.  Music, Music, Music.  Boys, Boys, Boys: A Memoir--a great title for a wonderful memoir!  The title is based a comment by Viv Albertine's mother when Viv was a teenager, saying all Viv was interested in was clothes, music, and boys. Although I suspect that is true for many teenage girls, Viv stands out by how she throws herself into punk fashion, music, and the boys in the bands.I know only a little about the 1970s musical era in this memoir, but that didn't impact my enjoyment of the book.  Viv's drive to learn, to play, to experience music and life is timeless.  For the first part of the book, Viv is young, reckless, and free, surrounded by music and boys.  In the second half of the story, a more mature Viv has sought out stability, created a family, and struggled with her health.  But underneath her carefully constructed life, there is still a flicker of desire to be more, do more, and learn more.Clothes, Music, Boys is a well-written and engaging memoir.  One doesn't need to be a fan of 1970s music, early punk fashion, or girl bands to appreciate the coming of age story of a creative, sometimes lost, woman.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CHA3KSNZO406/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTIOYGA#wasThisHelpful","R2CHA3KSNZO406","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How to Be a Heroine is a medley of what the author did and did not learn from heroines in classical fiction. Ms. Ellis explores a variety of major female characters in fiction, ranging from the Little Mermaid to Anne of Green Gables to Lizzie Bennett to the four women in Valley of the Dolls. Context for each exploration jumps from the personal life of Ms. Ellis to the times and lifestyles of some of the authors, with no discernible pattern.Ms. Ellis is a very talented writer, and her skill keeps the reader engaged when the topic becomes slow and dragging. Although it's always enjoyable to re-visit favorite literary heroines, and to see them from another's perspective, the point of this book is primarily the author's enthusiasm for the topic and the aforementioned writing skills. Otherwise, it's a bit thin and tempting to skim.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19M6GSDORTUPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101872098#wasThisHelpful","R19M6GSDORTUPF","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The tubes can be an addendum to other types of workouts, but I don't think they can be your only strength building toolIf you need an inexpensive or portable muscle / strength builder, these will do the job (even with buying the handles separately).

The positives of this cream is that it is very lightly scented, and it absorbs into your skin in just a few minutes, without any greasy feel.  To reduce sun or age spots, I think you would have to use this cream as part of a regimen, including a good sunscreen.The negative if this cream is that it is in a thick, plastic, non-recycleable jar.

"I've been using the Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Peel for nearly three weeks, and have had a positive experience.  I have dry skin, and I don't usually have many blemishes or acne.  However, I am using a prescription antibiotic cream on some facial abrasions, and when the cream touches any other part of my face, I'll break out.The label directions say to leave the peel on your face for 10 minutes, but as I have dry skin, I tested several different times.  I found that 3 minutes was not long enough, but between 5 - 7 minutes worked well.  It's most convenient for me to use the peel directly after a shower, but I think your skin will be less sensitive if you wait.  The peel tingles a little bit, but that stops in a minute or less.  Then I just gently remove the peel with warm water and followed with a moisturizer.The small, red blemishes I had virtually disappeared, and some of the newer / larger blemishes were smaller and less red.  By the next day, the marks from the smaller blemishes were gone. This exceeded my expectations, and although I doubt the result would be the same on severe acne, it demonstrated to me that the Juice Beauty Peel made a material difference.I also like that the product is USDA organic, which may be a marketing claim, but still---better to be organic than not!  The peel is in an easily recycled glass jar, and not a #5 or #7 plastic, which is great.Overall, I would highly recommend this product, just be sure to test different times and follow with a moisturizer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1ROQPSJHS10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JCVSV0#wasThisHelpful","R2F1ROQPSJHS10","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Ava Fischer is a graduate student, leading a peaceful but intense academic life when an former boyfriend, Paul, contacts her and asks for her help in solving an ancient code.

Unknown to her, the code and the ancient artifacts holding it are being pursued by more people than just Paul and his boss, and these other pursuers are brutal and ruthless.The plot unfolds quickly, with a very deep theme relating to Catholic history and pending election of a new pope.  Ava and Paul cross country and cultural borders in their pursuit of the truth and to get away from the pursuers, they are helped by a diverse group of people--a friend of Ava's back in Boston, two young boys with a boat, an anonymous computer hacker, Paul's boss, and members of the Catholic church. Equally, they are betrayed by people in their network, and fearful of trusting or endangering anyone.The Cana Mystery is full of wonderful details about the church, archeology, the bible, ancient languages, and geography.

Don is a professor at a University in New York City, and Rosie is a doctorate student.  Don has made some accommodations in his rigid life rules, and Rosie has learned to live with some of Don's idiosyncrasies.  Real life has begun to intrude into the honeymoon, as Rosie is stressed about completing her doctorate and Don's philandering friend appears headed for divorce.In the midst of this, Rosie announces that she is pregnant, and Don is stunned with surprise, unknowns, all all the variables that need to be managed.  Don begins to both live inside his head, researching parenthood, and focusing externally on his friends and their issues.  As in The Rosie Project, Don inadvertently gets himself into all types of trouble, but his logic and charm rescue him.With the pressures and distractions, Rosie begins to question her marriage and Don's suitability as a father, leading Don first to panic and then to try to apply logic to a situation ruled by his heart.  This part of the book was a bit of a muddle for me--was Rosie over reacting due to stress and her pregnancy?  Knowing Don, hadn't she considered what his reaction would be?  Is this just a technique to make for an engaging plot?  Or is it just the natural progression of what happens when these delightful people grow up, grow old, and need to deal with what life brings them?Either way, in the end, The Rose Effect is still a good book, and a must read for anyone who enjoyed the Rosie Project.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R55H4N0OH6OYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476767319#wasThisHelpful","R55H4N0OH6OYO","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have a 47"" Vizio television, and have been considering getting a sound bar or speaker to improve the quality of music and movies.  The Bose CineMate 15 is very easy to set up, we did it in less than 30 minutes.  The sound bar itself is an unobtrusive black rectangular box that fit easily under the wall mounted television.  The subwoofer is larger than I'd like, and takes up  bit of floor space.  I think one of the challenges is that the wall mounted television is a clean, sleek look and any peripherals look messy.At first, the sound was different from the television speaker.  Not bad, just different.  Once we became accustomed to the new sound, it was fine, with a much better bass.  The sound is really good for movies, ball games, and some music.  We do not play many games on our TV, but I can see this speaker being great if we did.The only downside of this speaker system is that it is another remote.  We chose to keep using our TiVo remote, as it is what I am used to, and then take an extra step to turn on the Bose.All in all, this speaker system is the high quality sound that you expect from Bose.  The easy set up of the system is a real plus, and it wasn't terribly over packaged.  I can highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality home theater system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UTXPPBH0FPQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1SSWXU#wasThisHelpful","R1UTXPPBH0FPQP","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have one tooth / spot in my mouth that is sensitive.  My dentist has looked at this a few times, and he finally cured the worst of the pain by correcting my bite.  However, a small amount of pain and sensitivity has remained, and it gets worse when I am stressed and grinding my teeth at night.I followed the directions and applied the Sensi-Stop strip to the approximate area that bothers me.  It can be difficult to tell exactly which tooth, but the strip is big enough I knew I was close.  The first strip didn't seem to have an impact, so I used another strip about two days later, and that worked.  It wasn't a cure--I won't be putting ice or anything cold directly on that tooth anytime soon, but it was enough to relieve the small pains that I would feel in general every day.For me, the relief lasts about 14 - 17 days.  I suspect that the efficacy depends on how painful your tooth is, what you eat, and your overall dental care.  My tooth doesn't bother me so much that I have to use this, but I do appreciate when it is not quite so sensitive and I think using this produce 2 or 3 times a month a good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REENVRE8CDZ92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L1I1V44#wasThisHelpful","REENVRE8CDZ92","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had read about Hyaluronic Acid, and had wanted to try it, but wasn't sure where to fit it in my routine.  The advice I was given was to apply the OZ Natural Vitamin C Serum, wait a few minutes, apply the OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Serum, and then moisturizer.  I tried this, adding sunscreen at the end, and it didn't quite work.  I found that I need to be careful that my sun screen didn't pill, and also that I was getting some dry and peeling patches.  However--I was trying this product while I was recovering from an accident where I bruised and cut my face, and perhaps that had an impact.Separately, I tried this Serum with the Vitamin C Serum and a heavy moisturizer or just this Serum and a heavy moisturizer at night, and I liked that better.  This Serum helps your skin absorb the moisturizer, and when I woke up, my skin felt soft and not at all dry.  I suggest you may get the best results trying a few different things that work for you.  I really like the Vitamin C Serum in the day, so I'll continue to try different moisturizers (maybe a moisturizing mask?) with this at night.  I was happy with my initial results, but I think there is the potential for the product to do even more if I find the right routine.Note:  I was provided a sample of this product by the manufacturer to review, and the opinions in the review are my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QJUHNOOQPQ9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7DYBX0#wasThisHelpful","R2QJUHNOOQPQ9V","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the opportunity to try this Vitamin C Serum, the Hyaluronic Serum, and the OZ Eye Gel all at the same time.  Unfortunately, a few days after I started using all three products, I was in an accident and scraped, bruised, and cut my face--including stitches and some bad abrasions.  However, after a week or so, I had enough clear skin on parts of my face that I could begin using the products again, and lucky for this review, could do my own comparison of my skin with and without the OZ Naturals.I like the OZ Vitamin C Serum a lot.  You just need a small amount on your face and neck, and then I rub whatever is left on my hands.  Sometimes, it makes my skin feel a tight, but a little moisturizer fixes that. The best way I can describe it is the serum made my skin glow and look clear and smooth.  It didn't make me break out, and after a few minutes, you don't even feel it.  I added moisturizer and sunblock on top of the serum, and everything worked fine.  The glow lasted most of the day, and it was cumulative, getting better the more days in a row I used the serum.At night, I tried the Vitamin C Serum plus the Hyaluronic Acid plus several moisturizers.  In the morning, my skin felt soft and moist if I used a heavy moisturizer.  I suspect that this combination will be a good one to re-try in the winter when my skin is drier.It was wonderful for me to have some nice facial skin surrounding my cuts that were loaded with greasy antibiotic ointment!  I will keep using this product, and I can't wait until I can use it on my entire face.  I have previously used Prevage, which also did a nice job for me, but I hated the wasteful packaging.  The OZ Naturals is 1/3 of the cost of Prevage, had largely the same affect, and is in a glass bottle I can recycle.Note: I received a sample of this product to review, and the opinions in this review are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZJ8NYRZ07XPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPE9EQO#wasThisHelpful","RZJ8NYRZ07XPA","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Perfect Stranger has all the components of a good beach read, but falls slightly short.  The theme plays upon some common fears--a group of women who blog about their experiences with breast cancer, find each other on line, and become virtual friends. The terror of the disease, the occasional hesitation about sharing your innermost thoughts with strangers, and the close relationships with women that you really don't know for sure are who they say the are creates an atmosphere of normality mixed with unease.The bloggers represent some broad categories of women--the affluent, happily married mother, a schoolteacher with a tendency to drink too much socially and make poor choices, a lonely woman whose life is driven by her unloving, distant mother, a secretive woman who carefully hides her personal details, and a kind, older matriarch that ties the group together.  When the matriarch is murdered, the women travel to her funeral, meeting each other in real life for the first time.The Perfect Stranger unfolds as the women get to know each other better, decide to spend a weekend together, and then each begins to worry about the who, what, and why of the murdered woman.  Here, the book escapes any strands of credibility, with the murderer actually contributing to the dialog, the secretive woman has an explosive past, and most of the women decide to spend a weekend together.  This plot tactic is ridiculous--who invites strangers you've met once to your home for  a weekend when one of your group was recently murdered?The Perfect Stranger is an OK, quick read, you can skip over some parts without losing the plot.  It would have been better if one or two of the side plots had been eliminated.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FVF64VHI3BM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062222406#wasThisHelpful","R1FVF64VHI3BM0","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somewhere Safe with Somebody Good continues the story of all the Mitford characters we've come to know.  Father Tim and his wife Cynthia have just returned from a vacation in Ireland, and are attempting to define what they want from their retirement life.  Progress has not entirely skipped over Mitford or its residents.  There are new politics, new shop keepers, and Dooley (Father Tim's adopted son) is growing up and focusing on a career and marriage.Somewhere Safe with Somebody Good is exactly what we have come to expect from a Mitford novel.  The pace is slow, the characters are mostly nice, sad things happen but everyone pulls together in the end.  If you are a fan of the Mitford novel, you must read this just to find out what Father Tim and his friends have been doing.  If you are new to the series, you'll enjoy this book much more if you wait to read it and instead start at the beginning of the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R305JNE0OB06Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167447#wasThisHelpful","R305JNE0OB06Y1","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several microfiber dusters, all of which are long withe short fibers.  The OXO Delicate Duster has a poof of long fibers, similar to a dandelion or the hair of the mascot of a certain fast food chain.  The long fibers and relatively short handle let you gently dust your various delicate dust collectors.  I sued the OXO Delicate Duster to dust some small vases, a paper filigree, and two lighting sconces.  The ""Good Grips"" refers to a rubber handle that helps to prevent the duster from slipping in your hand.I quite like the OXO Good Grips Microfiber Delicate Duster.  It allowed me to quickly (but still carefully) dust some decorative items.  I cheated a bit (as I am recovering from a bad fall) and used the duster on a few coffee tables and hard to reach areas, and it also worked well.  The head of the duster is washable, although I'd probably just rinse it in the kitchen sink if necessary.  The only thing I would change is that I wish the manufacturer would mark the name of the replacement head on the handle.  It was on the product tag, but that will be long recycled by the time I want to buy a new duster head.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RVES58NSFWU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWNVEXK#wasThisHelpful","R2RVES58NSFWU7","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dear Daughter: A Novel is entirely from the perspective of Jane Jenkins, but what a perspective that is!  Jane, or sometimes Janie, or sometimes Rebecca is an heiress and a former convict, released from prison on a technicality.  Her crime? Killing her cold, distant, and mean-spirited mother. although Jane has no memory of doing this.  Equally, Jane was convicted of being an odd, entitled, sarcastic, and also somewhat mean wealthy teenager.Once out of prison, Jane has just a few slender clues to try to find out what really happened the night Jane's mother died.  These clues also may lead Jane to learn more about who her mother really was, and even perhaps finding Jane's father.  Jane ends up in a small South Dakota town, where she meets a varied cast of characters while under constant pressure from her own mind, a blogger who taunts her, and a public who is willing to expose Jane to ridicule and trial by the popular press.Dear Daughter is a very well written first novel, although a bit uneven.  Some parts are truly gripping, while other parts are a bit rambling. The ending all comes in a bit rush, and doesn't quite deliver on the initial promise.  However, if you are looking for a new author, or a fresh view, Dear Daughter is certainly worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYYWUVNJKCVYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016381#wasThisHelpful","RYYWUVNJKCVYP","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll Drink to That is a memoir by Betty Halbreich who after created and then ran personal shopping at Bergdorf Goodman.  The book starts out with Betty's affluent, coddled, but lonely childhood.  Her parents were often too busy for her, but always made sure Betty had fine food and beautiful clothes.  Shortly after the end of WWII, Betty is swept away by a handsome, fast talking and fun living New Yorker.  Caught up in the after war frenzy of fashion and partying, Betty constructs a luxurious and proper home and lifestyle.As her children grow up, Betty becomes frustrated with her lack of purpose and empty marriage, and after asking her husband to move out, has a nervous breakdown. Fighting to save herself, she falls into jobs in her comfort zone of helping women to dress well.  Not one for cash registers or actual selling, Betty proposes the concept of personal shopping at Bergdorf Goodman, starting a 40+ year career helping all types of women find the clothes to help them look their best.  But often, Betty is more than a shopper, helping women build their confidence, display their inner strengths via their clothing, and offering advice of all types.I enjoyed I'll Drink to That the most when Betty wrote about the fashion extravagances after the war, and the time earlier in her career when women's clothing was distinctly different by designer, and of high quality, and not the mass produced trash offered to most of us today.  If you enjoy fashion, or books about retail stores, you'll find much to interest you in I'll Drink to That.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TKMPLM4S03HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205701#wasThisHelpful","R3TKMPLM4S03HA","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using a Philips Sonicare Toothbrush for at three years and will never use anything else! I like these brushes so much, I have two.  One is a more expensive version, with multiple speeds and a sanitizer.  After having forgotten this brush at a hotel once, I was not willing to bring it on any more trips.However, I do travel a lot, and now that I'm used to the Sonicare brush, I hate using anything else.  This brush is perfect for travel--it's just the brush and a small charger.  I put the clear plastic cap over the bristles, put everything in a water proof pouch, and this is ready to travel the world.  The best part is this new version has a charging indicator.  I have several devices to charge when I travel, and hotel rooms never have enough convenient outlets.  So, be able to know if the brush is charged or not is great, and a big improvement over earlier models.I can't recommend this brush enough, I've gotten everyone in my family one! Not only does the brush clean your teeth, it helps prevent you from injuring your gums with vigorous brushing. Everyone should have a Sonicare, and this model really has everything you need at a reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B9ODKBSM9857/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZHP49K#wasThisHelpful","R1B9ODKBSM9857","A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FJ5NWS5LQ9LN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is one of the best publications that I  have encountered in the past many years.  The attributes are as follows:  Firstly, and most important is the fact that in  the use of the word LOW  in describing the vocal  range of a book, it has often been the case that the keys of the song are more geared to voices on the high side; like Mezzo sopranos who are comfortable singing in the upper part of the staff: E, F, F#, G and sometimes higher.  This book is actually low and more geared to the Contralto and HALLELUJAH  for that because there are not many books that qualify for the really low voices.  In addition, the songs are quite interesting, much variety, less difficult Barber than many of his later songs such as most of the Hermit Songs, whose low book I own, but low in name only.The package includes an excellent CD that includes both performance and Accompaniment  The performance performers are:  Mezzo soprano, Kathleen Sonnentag; baritone, Kurt Ollmann and Piano, Richard Walters.  Two of the songs are world premiere:  ""Mother, I cannot mind my wheel"" and ""Hey nonny no!"".  There is one song from the Hermit Songs: :"" The Crucifixion"", two keys lower than usual GREAT!  It is a very nice collection and demonstrates Barber's gift for writing lyrically for the voice.Also included is information about Barber as well as comments and detail about each song!  All you seekers of something special in vocal publications, go for this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TX8JHHTZIE6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423438949#wasThisHelpful","R2TX8JHHTZIE6R","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being that confirmed Bach-a-holic I can unequivocally say that for me it is an absolute fact!!!!And if I wasn't totally convinced before I listened to this disc, I AM NOW. It somewhat distresses and surprises me that for this particular recording there is only one review and yet for many others by this group there are several.  Could it be that there are still individuals who relate anything that is performed by a symphony orchestra  as BORING!!!!! Well, not so.  If you out there are really country music fans you will love the selection of music on this disc. BECAUSE the program itself has much variety;  it includes classic country songs such as ""Cool Water"", ""Yellow Rose of Texas"", ""South of the Border"", ""Back in the Saddle Again"", ""Happy Trails"", ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" and that great song first recorded by Vaughan Monroe many years ago ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"".  There are a couple of interesting Medleys and much humor in the dialogue.  The Nashville Symphony is an added plus and for you who THINK that you don't like classical music there really is none on this disc.BUT the best reason to listen to this recording is because it is superbly performed:  great vocal renditions with words that are well-pronounced with clean articulation and smooth phrasing.  The instrumentalists are more than capable in their contributions and I (A Bach-a-holic) loved every note and I think that Bach would have enjoyed this music very much for he had lots of upbeat compositions of his own.  Why don't you try some of them!  You know the commercial: TRY IT YOU'LL LIKE IT.I am very grateful  to having met Sally Green (Ranger Doug's daughter) about a month ago in Nashville.  She is a charming girl and having heard her description of the Riders in the Sky I was anxious to hear them perform. She sent me this recording and it was a good choice; the combination of a symphony orchestra works very well. The following quote from Alan D. Valentine, President & CEO of the Nashville Symphony states: ""The idea of pairing a group of cowboy singers with an orchestra isn't all that outlandish.  After all, both outfits use a violin-the only difference is that in country/western music, it's called a fiddle.  And symphonic music has been a part of westerns since sound came to motion pictures....""He states several other reasons but buy the record and you can read them all!  Even though I have had it for only a short time I have listened to it multiple times.  GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!This is first class traditional country at its best, unsullied by 'pop', 'rap' or any other junk that has come along.  I  hold nothing against other forms of music  BUT COUNTRY SHOULD BE CLOSE TO FOLK MUSIC; BECAUSE IT IS AMERICA'S FOLK MUSIC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35XKL9JZ6MWZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006Q7N9VS#wasThisHelpful","R35XKL9JZ6MWZ9","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An exceptionally well-written, thoroughly documented biography covering the complete and unfortunately short life of George Butterworth (1885-1916).  All of Butterworth's surviving works are discussed along with an examination of his friendship with Vaughan Williams and the poet Housman from which he derived several of Housman's poems, the most notable of which are the setting of the six songs from The Shropshire Lad.  It was this cycle that led me to find out more about Butterworth; it's incredible beauty combined with Housman's very attractive poetry makes the entire package irresistible to the singer, as well as the audience as later proved by the wide popularity of the song cycle.  This, combined with the pathos created by the fact that this talented young composer just beginning his career was killed three weeks after he joined the Army by a German sniper along with several others of musical potential.  WHAT A DEVISTATING LOSS TO THE MUSIC WORLD.  And this ""the war to end all wars""!But the book does not dwell on this aspect, but instead  gives us the succinct picture of Butterworth's background, both family and education.  The author uses many footnotes, more than I used, but I did check what  I considered to be important in the overall picture.  I was really not much interested in his heritage, but many no doubt would be interested.  It did focus on the three periods, short though they were of his composing life and I learned a great deal by this portion of the book , which also included detailed examples and explanations of his individual compositions.The Folk Song era for Butterworth was the 2nd compostion period which I found particularly fascinating be cause it spoke of his association with many of other well-known composers interested in the Folk Music Revival; Cecil Sharp (also killed in the war), Vaughan Williams and several others.  Since I knew little or nothing about this period in music in England, it made for interesting reading.  Included were comments about the relationships and some were quite humorous.  One that I will include herein was made by the poet Housman when he discovered that Vaughan Williams had omitted two verses from is musical setting of the song ""Is My Team Ploughing?"" (This is one of the Shropshire lad Songs in which a ghost is communicating with a live friend-  A WONDERFUL SONG).  In The V.Williams setting he leaves out the words:  The goal stands up, the keeper Stands up to keep the Goal;  The composer's view was that any poet who had written such lines as those should be grateful to have them left out, a remark not made directly to Housman, but to a friend; Housman's response was ""I wonder how he would like me to cut out two bars of his music.""  Even the 'greats' can go at it!!!!!!The book moves forward clearly and at a reasonable pace; it stays with the story and includes many photographs of Butterworth and other involved in his life.  If you are a singer, especially a baritone, for that's what the songs were written for, but of course he did write instrumental music as well.  The last composing period was when he focused on instrumental writing and before he was killed wrote two significant instrumental pieces, as well as many other musical compositions.  All are listed in the book.  Everything you want to know about George Butterworth is herein.""In all of Butterworth's output, the man and the music are inseparable.  He was very much a man of the English countryside, as was Housman whose verses so fired the composer's imagination.  ......Butterworth was no innovatory composer, nor was his music very influential, but he will remain an important minor figure with a reputation based on a handful of works, the sincerity and musical value of which assure him a place in the history of English music.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VO3XQOUARSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0907689434#wasThisHelpful","R3VO3XQOUARSN","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a disappointment this book turned out to be!  There's nothing wrong with the writing, but the story, lacking any sort of plot, meanders on and on in a 'gossipy' style which some may find interesting, but I found dull and witless.  Perhaps my original perception of this book based upon reviews, not only on this website but throughout my research, was obviously erroneous. As pointed out by a previous reviewer, the book does not center on Handel, per se.  In fact, although Harry is telling his story, albeit in a very lackadaisical and somewhat confusing manner, it failed to whet my interest and I painstakingly waded through it all.

"This recording ""American Polyphony"" features highlights from the choral repertoire by twentieth-century American giants:  Samuel Barber(1910-1981), Leonard Bernstein(1918-1990), Aaron Copland(1900-1990), and Randolph Thompson(1899-1984).It heartens me that Stephen Layton has produced such a fine recording of American contemporary works.  He has chosen well his program and his small choir has more than done it justice. It seems that the ""Brits"" with their esteemed history of excellent choral singing has scored a great victory for twentieth-century American music.New to me were the four motets by Aaron Copland which I found very interesting in their construction and sound. The reason has to do with the fact that he actually composed these as exercises in his three year sojourn in Paris while studying with the eminent teacher Nadia Boulanger.  Each of the motets are settings of Old Testament texts and each maintains a distinct personality -  from the gently rocking serenity of ""Help us,O Lord"" to the rousing and upbeat jubilation of ""Sing we praises to our King"". Copland said of these motets that they are not his best work, for that was yet to come.  Interestingly enough, for me personally, I prefer them to some of his later works.  At the Conservatory where I studied these many years ago most of these composers were in their prime, so thus my opening caption about 'memory lane'.Samuel Barber was part of a composer's forum while I was a student, so I had the privilege of singing in the chorus directed by him for the concerts.  It was a memorable experience to be able to observe how a composer treats his own works.  Of course, the Agnus Dei was the high point. To hear it again and performed so beautifully was really a great listening experience for me and I think for many who know this work well and even if they never heard it before it's hard to resist it's 'pull' on the senses.Layton and the choir Polyphony gives an absolutely marvelous rendition of Bernstein's ""Missa Brevis"".  I have never sung this, but I have heard it many times, mostly in concert.  However, the voices on this disc far surpass any other renditions in my experience.  The two countertenors in their lengthy solo sections are producing wonderfully placed tones of great beauty and strongly implemented. I must name them because they deserve to be noticed:  David Allsopp(has appeared on many other recordings with similar results); Christopher Lowrey(I am not familiar with his background, but he sang well on this recording).  Their voices were important in the overall scheme of the composition and they acquitted themselves very well indeed.  I love this work by Bernstein, moreso since I heard this choir perform it.Who has not heard of or sang the great ""Alleluia"" of Randall Thompson!  It is one wonderful piece of music and what a great way to open this recording!

"The composer, Phil Klines' comments concerning this recording:  ""The ritual of the Mass itself is a kind of spiritual portal through which one can become part of a universal body...in the process of discovery I wished to pass unburdened by a rigid plan, formal or stylistic.  This is NOT a ""blues"" Mass any more than it is a  medieval one.  My  concept was to set the traditional Latin Ordinary (parts of the Mass that remain the same from week-to-week) for Chorus alone, and to add my own set of Propers (the parts that change from season to season) using a variety of texts, and to have these sections accompanied by the string quartet.""The chosen texts suggest a narrative of redemption in a blighted world, the origins of which are from the Old Testament, including two from the Lamentations of Jeremiah.  Interestingly, rather than choosing the New Testament apocalypse of Revelation, Kline chose from the American poet David Shapiro, whose image of indifferently falling snow recalls the ashes falling from the skies of Lower Manhatten; thus emerges the text for the Movement #6 ""The Snow Fell"".  Samuel Beckett's monologue emerges as a prayer in the Movement #8 ""The Unnamable"" which magnificently portrays the struggle of the mind in present times.  Movement #9 ""Dark Was the Night""  has no audible text; it is a fantasy on Willie Johnson's 1927 recording of an old hymn depicting Jesus' doubt at the Passion, paraphrased in wordless meaning.Bookending the Mass are Kline's settings of two Early American shape-note hymns from THE SACRED HARP:  Northport & Wondrous Love.  Kline states the ""they stir the vestiges of an unforgettable and mysterious beauty, the sound of strong emotion, unconditional and utterly lacking in malice"", that he recalls from the rural religion  he witnesses as a child in Pennsylvania and Ohio.The performance of this glorious music is absolute PERFECTION!  LIONHEART, a six male American Ensemble sings with clear and concise diction; every word distinct and all sounds produced perfectly placed and blended with each other's sounds; always with emotional fervor.  The accompanying string quartet ""ETHEL"" acquits itself with equal skill and much expression.This recording has made a profound impression on me and every time I listen I get something I haven't heard previously. That is one indication of a talented  composer who has much to offer. This recording goes at the top 2 percent  of my vast record collection accumulated over a period of 50 years.  Listen for yourself.  The musical world needs more of Kline's inspirational influence.  There is no libretto and there really  is no need for one.  With Lionheart's excellent word skills you won't miss a thing. BUT KEEP IN MIND THIS IS NOT BACKGROUND MUSIC!!!!But entertaining???YOU BET!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J9H10BJ33DGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001SO69U2#wasThisHelpful","R2J9H10BJ33DGZ","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Laments (Latin:planctus) have existed in all cultures for as long as there has been song.  They express affection, joy, sorrow and grief for people, places, or ideas that have gone from our lives.  In essence, lamentations are how we deal with loss.  This album is a compilation of laments I have performed since 1993 in conjunction with the passing of people who were significant to my life and work."" Michael Collver, 2006After almost 50 years of record-perusing and collecting it is not often that I find anything that unusual or surprising BUT this one packed me a powerful punch.  It is so incredibly moving and possesses some of the most interesting sounds such as:  Collver's very unique vocal tone qualities.  Although he is labeled as a counter-tenor and he IS that indeed, his voice throughout this recording makes a multitude of sounds at all levels of its registers.  This is particularly obvious in Track Two ""The Silver Swanne"" by Martin Amlis-1980, where he with the speed of light bounces back and forth from head to chest and sometimes in between. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  The final track ""Lamentation"" from Leonard Bernstein's Jeremiah Symphony also brings forth many tone colors.His second talent that increases the enjoyment of this recording is his use of the violin and piano in assisting the drama and pathos of the music herein.  Collver uses excerpts from the music of:  Guillaume de Machaut(Track 3)1100, a French song about lost love, and interprets it in his own way using voice and organetto; Robert Kyr,1993,A lament for the unnamed, sung in English with voice, violin and piano;  Martin Amlin(mentioned above), Gottfridus de ST. Victor (1180) Planctus ante nescia, Latin for unaccompanied voice.  There is information about each of the 8 selections on the record packaging which you will certainly want to read before or after listening.  Thus I did not list all the selections for this review would be much too long.  Suffice it to say the overall mood is a bittersweet sadness combined with the absolute fascination provided by each rendition of the music.The performers are highly skilled and are:  Michael Collver, countertenor- Peter Sykes, keyboards- Kinloch Earle, violin.  All American from Massachusetts.  The arrangements are exotic gems and priceless for the music listener. This is a hauntingly beautiful song cycle of Medieval and Contemporary Laments for countertenor voice, organetto, vox humana, violin and piano.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UT3NF7WUDKET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HSC7V6#wasThisHelpful","R1UT3NF7WUDKET","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Antoine Brumel(c.1460-1515), a notable contemporary of Obrecht & Josquin, was a top composer in the Franco-Flemish tradition; and is historically significant as the first truly French composer to be associated with the court of Burgundy.  His output was considerable by any standards, ranging over French songs of great charm, many motets, including fully-developed settings of complete psalms, and at least 16 Masses.  His settings, while exhibiting great contrapuntal skill, is nevertheless the work of a composer free in spirit.During the Renaissance, it was considered normal procedure for a Mass composition or Motet to make use of pre-existent material, and by the late 15th century, sacred music sometimes drew upon popular, folk or art songs.  Antoine Brumel's  Missa Berzerette Savoyenne takes its title and much of its distinctive material from a French chanson by Josquin with a text about a young man courting a shepherdess ( a song of seduction, as it were). Thus bringing into the church some of the frolicking quality and vigorous humor of the countryside.  This Mass is a lucid and gripping work and it is somewhat amazing to me that a composer can base an entire Mass on a seduction song.  But Brumel hides nothing for in the Kyrie the melody is clearly evident in the top line; later it is in the Tenor, but always audible.  Each movement presents new ideas, and the final Agnus Dei has an unbelievable number of repetitions.  As a piece of devotional music, it is questionable, but as pure enjoyment it is delightful.The Motets, especially the Heth, Cogitavit Dominus, were the best sung on the disc, but still left a lot to be desired which was a disappointment because I have never heard anything by Chanticleer that was not perfect.  My complaint herein has mostly to do with the balance of the voices, especially in the Mass.  The treble sound which is produced by four countertenors could have been better sung by two.  The voices of Randall Wong and Joseph Jennings and Louis Botto are usually aligned well with the other voices and blend well. It may be  that the other countertenor, Steven Rickards may be the one with the voice, sounding very female, and not well-blended. However it may be that having fewer countertenors would have solved the problem.  The group in addition to the 4 ct's, includes 3 tenors, 2 baritones and 3 basses. The first selection had at least one poor entrance (out of sync with the ensemble).  To say that the disc is not worth hearing would be a great mistake, and I will listen to it and enjoy hearing the music of BrumelRecorded in 1991-includes brochure with program and brief comments.

"This recording is comprised of musical gems from  13th & 14th century Italy. St. Francis of Assisi, born in 1182, was responsible for the eventual development of the LAUDE.  Franciscan humility,  devotion, joy and mystery find characteristic expression in the 'lauda', or song of praise.  Over the years the lauda incorporated new ideas of harmony, counterpoint, and form.  Laude soon began to be composed in two and three parts, then four and more.  Manuscripts from Bologna, Florence, Trier, and Venice serve as sources of 14th & 15th century polyphonic Laude for this program.  Finally in the 16th century, lauda musical texts began to appear with the names of their composers.  In 1508, Ottaviano Petrucci  published two printed books of laude the first of which consists of 66 compositions attributed to Innocentius Dammonis, 4 of which are included on this disc, a Monk of the congregation of San Salvatore in Venice.  No other music by this Renaissance master survives.The music on this recording is at times, hypnotic, exotic and erotic, but always engaging; I could not stop listening the first time I heard it.  It consists of five categories of happenings:  PROCESSIONAL (3 SELECTIONS); VIRGIN & CHILD (3 SELECTIONS); THE ANGEL'S MESSAGE(3 SECTIONS); BETHLEHEM(7 SECTIONS); EMMANUEL: GOD WITH US(7 SECTIONS).  The words are Latin and there is no translation, but it is not difficult to figure out what the songs are telling us!  But even if you can't the music itself is hard to resist.The ensemble Lionheart:  6 male singers with glorious voices and a marvelous sense of ensemble.  Their accomplishments thus far in the musical world are almost miraculous: perfect blend, precise diction, superior tonal resonance, smooth and correct phrasing and a host of dynamic subtleties characterize their singing.  A really excellent representative for the early music world.There is a brochure that gives some very useful background information of the material on this recording.

"Hans Leo Hassler (1564-1612) highly esteemed in his lifetime, was a contemporary of Schutz, Shakespeare, Byrd and Cervates.  He spent a year and a half in Venice as a pupil of Giovanni Gabrieli.  His musical style is lucid, luminous and transparent, easy to follow and enjoy.  Although Orlando de Lassus (1532-1594)was Hassler's model,Hassler forged his own style which was full of grace, restraint and a complete understanding between extrovert texts and reflective music.  This recording demonstrates all of the aforementioned attributes.  This music definitely displays a metrical and proto-chorale-like style.The four-person Penalosa Esemble, founded in 1996, clearly performs these compositions in the manner Hassler required.  Their enunciation is careful, precise, measured, fully in accord with Hassler's reserve.  Moreover, their approach is well-researched and considered, presenting this music in an open and plain style.  The very fine singers are:  Susan Eitrich, soprano; Sebastian Mory, male alto; Jorg Deutschewitz, tenor and Pierre Funck, bass.  They sing with perfect balance and an excellent sense of ensemble, that is as one.The theme of this collection of pieces (eight of which have not been recorded:  Tracks 1,12,18,19,20,23,26) is the period from Annunciation to New Year.  The ""Super Dixit Maria"" is a parody mass and on the disc it follows the single short song on which it was based.  The disc also includes narrative and celebatory works as well as the eight part Magnificat (Tr. 18) very exquisite and wonderfully performed.Listening to this for the first time was incredibly enjoyable and gave me a TRUE Christmas feeling, not to be acquired with much of the music via radio, TV holiday specials, malls etc etc etc.  The package is accompanied by pertinent information (including the text) in German and English.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO56RW5V081AR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPRJ9LK#wasThisHelpful","RO56RW5V081AR","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thus prints the Herald Times of the Concord Ensemble, to which I heartily agree.  Founded in 1997 as an a cappella all-male sextet of superior quality, the Concord Ensemble herein presents their first recording of Voices of Renaissance Spain.  It is a stunning testimony to their ability to deliver an exciting and entertaining performance. They join the ranks of other American small Early Music Ensembles such as Chanticleer and Lionheart. Unfortunately, there are only two recordings listed on Amazon that are available, both are Dorian recordings.The very fine singers in this ensemble are:  Paul Flight,countertenor;Pablo Cora,Tenor,countertenor ; N. Lincoln Hanks and Daniel Carberg, tenors; Sumner Thompson, baritone and Daniel Cole, bass; guest artist, Bruce Remaker, countertenor.  Some of the composers featured on this disc are:  Mateo Flecha(1481-1553), De Morales (ca1500-1553), Juan Vasquez (ca1510-ca.1560)and De Victoria(1548-1611).I enjoyed most of the selections and especially the opening number ""La Guerra""s by Mateo Flecha sung with enthusiasm and excitement as the subject required.  But my absolute favorite was Victoria's ""Missa Dum Complerentur"", but in fact the entire program is enjoyable.

"All the pomp and pageantry of eighteenth century Europe come vibrantly to life in this well-researched novel of the life of Carlo Broschi whose stage name was Farinelli, a male soprano who was the most celebrated castrato of his time. Alive with court intrigues, clandestine romances, and the horrors of the eighteenth century Spanish Inquisition, THE CASTRATO is a powerful example of historical fiction at its very best. I have read dozens of books concerning the circumstance that created the idea of the castrati; the main reason being that the Pope in the 17th-18th centuries forbade women to appear in public in a performing capacity.  This was based on St. Paul's commentary in the Bible. This topic has unfortunately supplied many fiction writers to attempt to spin their tales, most of which are totally of their own making, but there are a few books I have read that approach the subject much more intelligently and this is one of them.The author, Lawrence Louis Goldman has had 25 years of writing experience, covering all phases of the profession.  I was interested in why he chose this topic and he stated:  ""Listening to Beverly Sills (opera singer) appearing on a Dick Cavett program...I heard two jokes about castrati.  I looked up the subject and became fascinated by Farinelli's life.""And indeed this is a fascinating tale of tragedy, glory, love unrequited, pain and injustice perpetrated by royalty as well as the Church at that time.  IT'S AMAZING, SHOCKING BUT IT'S ALL TRUE!!!!  It is consoling in this day and age that women may appear in performance, but there is a whole generation of male falsettos who produce what I believe is similar to the castrati of old, and it is done naturally with the high false voice that men can produce, though not all achieve success in attempting to do so; just as in other voices, male or female.I include a quotation from the book:  ""So subtly that none could tell the exact moment, the silence gave way to sound.  A single high, clear tone impinged on the strained ears....Now one thought of a bird, but who remembered a bird which voiced as this one?...Constant in pitch, still carried on the same breath, it built in volume with the imminent arrival of its source....The listener, carried along, felt hair prickle on the back of the neck...felt his heart quicken and his own breath stop in a yearning to help, in some impossible way, the singer still concealed from view...""If you are a true lover of music histoty and the voice itself, this novel is for you.  Otherwise, avoid it!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93L9E6ZXYO1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0381982327#wasThisHelpful","R93L9E6ZXYO1Q","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1976, at the age of 33 years, David Munrow hanged himself, supposedly because he was depressed over the death of his Father and Father-in-law.  But he left behind a musical legacy focusing on medieval and renaissance music that is unsurpassed, especially considering his short life span. He brought medieval and renaissance music to a wider audience through books, television, radio and the 50 recordings that he produced.  His knowledge of instruments was vast and he played many of them from bassoon to shawm to crumhorn to recorder.My first encounter was his recording 2CD ""The Art of the Netherlands"", which was recorded in April,1975 shortly before he died.  I was immediately impressed by the quality of the performance as well as the knowledge and scholarly approach of the entire effort. This present disc was recorded in November 1975,even closer to his demise.  What a waste that a man of this ability should succumb to depression!!!!But no matter there is much we can grab onto that he has left behind.This disc contains about one half hour of instrumental and one half hour of vocal that is lightly accompanied.  The instruments as you might expect are varied and in the instrumental portion are uniquely arranged.  Some of the instruments are:  cornets, sackbuts,  recorders, percussion, dulcian, shawn, crumhorns, violins, viols, chitarrone, organ, baroque guitar and harpsichord. There are three voices included in the six vocal selections:  James Bowman, countertenor; Martyn Hill & Paul Elliott, tenors.  Very fine singing from these notable personages!.  Two familiar names in the instrumental line-up are Christopher Hogwood & Nigel North.The highpoints for me were the second group of five dances (Track 5) by Mainerio; they reminded me very much of what I might hear from an oldtime square dance in the USA .  Vocally I really liked all but especially Track 6 by Porta ""Corda deo dabimus""  and Track 11 ""O Beate Benedicte"" by Grandi.The  performance was impeccable and inspirational, certainly to the Early Music lover.

"The ensemble Voces Aequales is comprised of six male singers who came together in 1993, under this name to perform the sacred vocal music of the Renaissance.Valentin Bakfark was a Transylvanian composer and  an outstanding lutenist in the 16th century.  Although his output  was rather small, his fame spread from the French court and all the way to VILNIUS and many places in between.  His lute music is in the form of intabulations which originate from pre-existing polyphonic vocal pieces for the lute.In this recording, the vocal ensemble Voces Aequales takes an unusual approach to Bakfarks' intabulations; the latter are performed first by lutenist, Istvan Gyori and are followed by the vocal original performed by the vocal ensemble.  These are alternated throughout the disc.One must give 'kudos' to the Voces Aequales for skill and creativity, because what they have done is produce an album of lute music for the voice.  However, no matter how faithful Bakfark's intabulations are implemented, they sound nothing like the vocal originals. I am presently searching for an album in which Voces Aequales performs in a more traditional manner, for their skill is obvious!The accompanying booklet  is in English, French, German; and includes the words to all the songs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39HPIBDBSAAKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OYC2ZS#wasThisHelpful","R39HPIBDBSAAKL","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The influence of Raphael (1483-1520)has probably exceeded that of any other painter in history.  For centuries his works were revered as perfect models of grace and harmony, to the point where every kitsch Madonna felt obliged to plunder his manner and techniques.  On this CD, the world of Raphael is given a musical perspective with a selection of pieces that he might have heard frequently in his era.Well into the 16th century, the musicians at the Northern Italian courts were mostly French or Flemish.  The native Italian tradition is represented by songs known as ""frottoli"", with their melodic top part, instrumental accompaniment and strong harmonic bass; a form which would eventually develop into the Italian Madrigal.The music on this disc mixes frottoli with the more complex French Chansons.  The two more familiar composers represented are Alexander Agricola and Josquin Desprez.  There are 7 other composers who have made excellent contributions to this recording and several anonymous selections are present.  They are all quite unique and entertaining with very interesting combinations of instruments and voices, both in combination and in solo spots.Some of the highpoints for me are:  Track 6: ""je suis d'allemagne-je suis trop"" an exuberant solo voice singing over a sustained string tone.  Track 10: ""Carro della morte"" features the unaccompanied entire solo vocal ensemble; beautiful to hear.  AND  Track 14: ""Non e tempo"" entire ensemble with light string accompaniment.  In truth there was one only instrumental selection I did not like; no need to mention it because YOU may like it.  This is really a 'listening gem'.The singers and musicians of Ensemble Unicorn perform infectiously with much gusto when needed and display all the qualities of sensitive and musical individuals.

"The pieces on this recording reflect the constant glacial movement of longing that found expression through the images of women in medieval England:  women as sacred, women as beloved, women as regal, women as hunted, women as sorrowful, and women as triumphant...and the kaleidoscopic tensions ensuing from the yearning to express.This disc dates from 1996, and was one of the first opportunities for the world to hear the American vocal ensemble Lionheart.  It was constructed as something of a concept album-quite rare in some respects-of 'Images of Medieval Women.  The images being: The Beloved, The Unfathomable, The Maternal, The Desired and The Triumphant.  Within these categories one will find music by  composers such as: John Dunstable, William Cornysh, Richard Pygott, John Browne along with several Sarum Chants and anonymous contributions.Interspersed throughout the disc are movements from the Sarum Chant, which was the prevailing Catholic Plainsong in use in England with until the time of the Reformation.  The Plainsongs serve as the disc's connecting theme in the exploration of the feminine images.Lionheart, a six member male is ensemble is notable of the purity of its articulation and for the tonal blend and balance it puts forth.  These traits allow the singers to respond  with the special sounds required in both the Sarum Chant and the bawdier settings.  Though the composer Cornysh is responsible for the most emotional utterances as in 'Adew mes amours', it is John Browne's contribution, which is the 14 minute setting ""Oregina mundi clara"", that is the most moving of all.  And Lionheart sings all of this music with much feeling and skill that makes for inspirational listening!Of all the male vocal ensembles I have encountered recently in my Early Music searches, this one pleases me the most! From my first hearing of the album 'Tydings Trew', I was 'hooked'.  GO FOR IT, especially if you love Early Music.

"This two CD package is the 7th volume of vocal music in the series of recordings that comprise the work of Dietrich Buxtehude (c1637-1707)from acclaimed early music specialist Ton Koopman and Amsterdam Baroque.  It features chorale settings, arias, ciacconas, concertos and a cantata.These vocal works of Buxtehude showcase all major genres used in the Lutheran Church during the last half of the seventeenth century.  Included are particular chorale settings, concertos on biblical texts, arias on contemporary sacred poetry, dialogues and composite forms such as concertos, arias and cantatas.  The performers, both singers and instrumentalists, are highly skilled and together have created an excellent and enjoyable program.  There are six singers:  Sopranos are A.Dieltiens, G. Samann,  D. Wolgemuth;  male alto Maarten Engeltges; tenor Tilman Lichdi, and bass Klaus Mertens.  Engeltjes is one of the best countertenors of the younger generation; his sound much like his teacher Michael Chance with whom he has studied and may still be.  Bass Klaus Mertens has long been outstanding in his contributions through the years.  There are seven instrumentalists who play:  violin, viola, viola da gamba, violone,dulcian, lute and organ.There are many interesting vocal combos as well as solos that comprise these two discs.  Some of the highpoints for me were: Track one on disc one:  the selection for alto, tenor and bass ""An Filius non est Dei"" BuxWV6. The music itself is incredibly attractive and was sung with much vigor by Engeltjes, Lichdi and Mertens. On Track 5 was Klag-lied sung with much feeling by Engeltjes. This BW76 is a  strophic aria setting with a highly expressive melody for voice, strings and continuo, on a text written by Buxtehude on the death of his father.  Engeltjes more than did it justice.  On Disc 2, track 2 Lichdi, tenor sang the ""Quemadodum desiderat servus BuxWV92"" gloriously!  There were many other highpoints for me but I am sure if you purchase this album you will find many of your own!The accompanying booklet includes pertinent information and translation in English, German and French.  This is a quality recording as the BBC Music Magazine states:""Koopman and his Amsterdam forces get the scale of the music just right, providing a compelling example of how less can be more.

These three discs are as follows:  CD One=  Johannes Ockeghem:  Requiem (Missa pro defunctis) & Missa Mi-mi(1984) with the corps group of singers who are:  David James (countertenor),  Roger Covey-Crump, Leigh Nixon & John Potter (tenors); Michael George, David Beavan (basses) and Paul Hillier baritone and director. A welcome addition to the group was countertenor, Michael Chance, whose mellow lush sounds took away some of the harshness of James's usual tone quality.  This exact recording in its entirety is still available on the Marketplace.CD TWO =  Josquin Desprez ""Motets and Chansons""  This is really a group of selections taken from two recordings (still available) entitled Josquin Desprez: Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae and Josquin Desprez: Motets and Chansons.  (1983). The singers on this recording are:  David James, Ashley Stafford (added personnel) countertenors; Covey-Crump, Leigh Nixon & Paul Elliott (added personnel) (tenors), Michael Goerge (bass), Paul Hiller, bass.CD THREE (MY personal favorite).  Orlande de Lassus :  ""Penitential Psalms""(1985)  However, this is only the second disc from the original two disc recording.  This inludes only Psalms 4, 5, 6, and 7. Thankfully on this recording Michael Chance is assisting David James on countertenor making a great contribution to the overall sound quality of the treble.  The only  other added personnel appears to be Charles Daniels on tenor (another welcome addition) and Gordon Jones on baritone.  The original recording of the entire Penitential Psalms is available on the Marketplace at the moment at a reasonable price.  But it changes from day to day.  Even though I already own the Ockeghem and the Lassus I decided since my recordings are of long standing it would be prudent to purchase this combo.I cannot honestly say that this group has always been one of my chosen ensembles, but for many listeners, that may not be the case.  I simply find that unless the treble sound is modified by the addition of a more pleasant sounding voice, I can't deal with it for very long.  But let me end with some comment from GRAMOPHONE MAGAZINE who are surely more skilled than I am in assessing these recordings.GRAMOPHONE MAGAZINE: "" To be treasured by anyone who wants the best of Renaissance music authoritatively performed....The blend between the voices is finely controlled, the tone mellow and the tuning spectacularly accurate, giving rise to an organ-like sonority that is genuinely thrilling.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N4ZUDJ0P48KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX67LTM#wasThisHelpful","R2N4ZUDJ0P48KM","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of course, I am referring to that six-male ensemble ""LIONHEART"". My first encounter with this group was by way 0f the Recording ""Tydings Trew"" which was noted by the New York Times with the following commentary:  ""rich true tones and flawlessly blended harmonies...superb articulation and impeccable sense of rhythm"". And it's all true: to hear an American ensemble with this absolute perfection in performance is a marvel, for most of my years have been spent buying European ensembles (which I will still buy, for there are many quality ensembles all over the world).  But for a long time in USA the one outstanding ensemble was Chanticleer which remains on my excellent list.On this disc ""El Siglo de Oro"" (The Century of Gold), Lionheart explores the seldom performed sacred music of 16th century Spain related to the eclectic, multi-cultural city of Toledo: from the worldly sounds of Cristabal Morales to the roguish Andalusian exuberance of Francisco Guerrero. This intense, mystical music thrived in the Old World and gained wide acceptance in the New World.The six very fine voices in this group belong to:  Lawrence Lipnik, countertenor; John Olund & Michael Ryan-Wenger, tenors; Jeffrey Johnson, Richard Porterfield, baritones and Kurt-Owen Richards, bass. Their blend is uncanny, the balance is perfect, the diction precise, the phrasing exceptionally musical, the dynamics appropriate to the music;  the overall effect is very entertaining to the listener; especially those attuned to the Early Music era.The booklet includes pertinent information in English which includes the translation of the libretto.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R356Y0NEUY7R4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LP4OH4#wasThisHelpful","R356Y0NEUY7R4W","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cain is beating a dead horse as the saying goes, when she keeps reviving the evil Gretchen and aligning her with Archie, who, in my opinion lost his mind a couple of books ago. This book overdoes the sex, the perversion, and includes action that at times is so absurd as to be surreal.  Even at the beginning of the story I lost interest in the entire scenario; it was mundane and unoriginal.  Moreover, the story plods along just waiting for the next vulgar and boring development.  It's time to go in other direction, probably with new characterizations.  This book left a really bad taste in my psyche!","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZH56TKU37XDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312619812#wasThisHelpful","RZH56TKU37XDY","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""This music is at once mystical and earthy, romantic and aloof, surreal and mundane, gay and morbid by turns drenched in (as the famous Spanish  expression says) 'son y sombra' - sun and shadow"".  Spanish and Portuguese Music of the Golden Age.  The design herein is in the form of a three-act play using as music songs and instrumental pieces typical of the time.  This should please the historically minded listener with its evocation of the Iberian nations at the height of their imperial splendor and also the world music listener with its instantly memorable melodies and highly infectious rhythms from the European culture.The Waverly Consort is outstanding for its ability to assemble  highly varied and interesting programs, and this disc is certainly speaks to this ability.  There are selections six of which are completely instrumental very cleverly arranged and immediately engaging.  The instruments used throughout the disc, also including the accompaniment are:  recorder, harp, gemshorn, percussion, vihuela, baroque guitar, citole, psaltery, bass viol, kemence, vielle & violone, that require the skills of four players.Varied combinations of voices are used involving the following singers:  2 sopranos=Phoebe Alexander & Shannon Anderson; mezzo soprano=Carolann Buff; countertenor & baritone= Bruce Rameker;  tenors=Wm. Hudson & Andrew Ranson; Baritone= Gregory Purnhagen.  The voices are very open-sounding and energetic as befits this type of music; great performance from all the singers.The Waverly Consort on this recording performs overall with its customary style providing their usual vigorous and tuneful interpretations.  There is an excellent and highly detailed booklet  that includes pertinent information as well the complete text, which you will definitely want to read before listening to the disc. The Spanish text is translated into English.I could not resist including the closing paragraph of the colorful booklet which so wonderfully incorporates and describes the upbeat and delightful music that is on this recording:  "" Now we invite you to our ""Comedia de la Vida"" - a play about Life.  You will meet highborn people: brave 'cavalleros' - knights in exile or on chivalric missions - and the women who love them in their absence.  Elsewhere there are not so noble: peasants, country bumpkins, and their amorous companions.  And of course, there is dance music; chaconas, canaries, villanios, jacaras, folias, cumbees - Ole!""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BZF4EAQMKR13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000926RQ#wasThisHelpful","R1BZF4EAQMKR13","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A leopard on familiar terrain, he moved  on silent feet through still rooms and along airless corridors. Not once did he have to pause, uncertain, and feel his way forward in the darkness; the route was one he had played out in his imagination a thousand times.  His eyes burned in their sockets, and a maniacal grin distorted the curve of his jaw into a twisted demonic parody of joy.  Already, in his mind's eye, he could see Strozzi's startled eye springing open, wide in terror,as the sudden hand clamped over his mouth and, a second later, the honed blade sliced through the cords....It was to be the sweetest moment of his  revenge.""  from 'The Last Castrato'.The above paragraph is the brand of excellent descriptive writing you will experience if you read this novel, and you MUST read it if you are of the ilk mentioned in my introductory heading. There is nothing trite about this novel.  Rather it contains all of the best attributes: a plausible and unique plot that moves forward and not once bogs down;  good characterizations that are well-developed but not belabored; and a satisfactory ending of it all.  This for me was an ""I can't put it down novel""..  And it's one that I will hang on to and definitely read it again in a few years.  And you certainly can't balk at the present price.

"'these selections are Spanish works that were widely copied in the Old World as well as the New, and there's none of the African or Amerindian influence that began to creep into Spanish music in Central and South America.  However, it is no less interesting and it even offers some of the fascinating mixture of sacred and secular elements that makes the New World repertory so unique.  The Spanish were quick to copy Italian trends thus making these pieces hard to distinguish from Italian solo cantatas from the same era.The composers represented on this recording are generally new to non-Spanish audiences, and form a chain of teachers and students beginning with Diego Xaraba y Bruno, born around 1650;  director Banzo hypothesizes him to be the composer of the only keyboard work on this album.  The other three works are sacred cantatas that correspond to Italian works from around the time of A. Scarlatti to perhaps the end of Vivaldi's lifetime.  The two composers are:  Joseph de Nebra (1702-1768);Joseph de Torres (1670-1738).The text and the music of these cantatas spawn a perfect fusion of sacred and secular. The  music, in fact, is quite sensuous, the flavor of which makes the listener want to hear MORE!  Countertenor, Carlos Mena, with his deep dark and somewhat sensuous voice is a perfect choice to sing this deep dark and sensuous music.  He is able to capture the music's occasional dark shadings and the indefinable philosophical tone that mark Spanish music.  Mena and the String Ensemble Al Ayre Espanol together are perfectly attuned to each other as well as to the various stylistic threads in the music.The disc is accompanied by a detailed booklet that includes the text in German, English and French.  The text takes some time to comprehend and though it is possible, I read it through just once ,  then ignored it and simply listened to the music, which is expressive and elegant and very well performed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A1Y7Z87KJSVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009XSMA8#wasThisHelpful","R3A1Y7Z87KJSVZ","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The music selected for this recording belongs to the great repertory of the late fifteenth century Spanish Renaissance making use of several composers, the most familiar being Tomas Luis de Victoria (1548-1611), Francisco Guerrero (1528-1599), Alonso Lobo (1555-1617), Cristobel de Morales (1500-1553), Juan Esquivel (1563-1613), Francisco de Penalosa (1470-1528) and Juan de Anchieta (1462-1523).This program is presented according to the fourteen Stations of the Cross that is included in the Catholic Encyclopedia.  These stations are used to signify a series of pictures representing certain scenes in the Passions of Christ each corresponding to a particular incident with each representation.  This form of devotion is carried out by passing from station to station with certain prayers at each meditation with various incidents in turn.The disc itself is a musical pilgrimage, in which every station is connected to a Motet.  Daria Tabbia (direction) explains in the brief booklet notes IN German & English;  "" the texts have been chosen imagining each motet pronounced by a character present at the stations of the cross"".  This means that we must hear -apart from Jesus, himself - Pilate, Simon of Cyrene, Mary Magdalena, Peter and Judas, all mentioned in the Gospels , but also Veronica and a wayfarer, mythological figures which don't appear in the Gospels.  The text is set by Julian Romero, a contemporary composer who has also set the text and composed the music for the Introduction and the ending.  Romero's music is modern, but not too far out of step with the rest of the program.The five excellent singers of Daltrocanto are:  Alena Dantcheva, soprano; Alessandro Carmignani, male alto; Gianluca Ferrarini, tenor; Marco Scavazza, baritone.  The ensemble gives a fine performance of these notable composers' selections; their voices blend well and the individual singers are highly responsive to the varied styles of composition.  Listening to this was an inspirational experience for me, personally and may be for others also.  This group has really not made many recordings; at least I haven't located many others.  Maybe somebody out there can enlighten me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R139ME945JBABV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071XS448#wasThisHelpful","R139ME945JBABV","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Chance has done it again: rendered to us a Master Performance of lute songs that is truly an emotional ride that includes precise and accurate diction accompanied by the highs and lows that the words demand, and all delivered with his strong and resonant tone quality.  This is musicianship at its highest level and what I have always expected from him for the last forty years, since I first heard him in 1973 with the King's  College Choir.  If there is such a thing as the X Factor, he more than meets it.  I have another recording of the complete works of John Danyel recorded in 1994 sung very well indeed by Nigel Short accompanied by a fine lutenist David Miller.  And I may still pull it out every now and then for comparison purposes.  However, Chance just engages me immediately no matter what he sings.The path of John Danyel (1564-1626), born one year after John Dowland (considered by many to be the greatest of the English lute song writers)is very similar to that of Dowland.  Danyel published his songbook in 1606, the very year that Dowland returned permanently to England from Denmark, and it is curious to see just how closely Danyel's work follows that of Dowland's third book. The excellent liner notes with this package go into much detail in this comparison.Danyel's songs run the gamut of emotions:  ""Can Doleful Notes?"" (Unmeasured grief); ""Eyes Look No More"" (pessimism-affliction-hopelessness); ""love in all its forms and moods ""Coy Daphne Fled"", ""Drop Not Mine Eyes"",  and the more recorded songs by other singers: ""Like as the lute Delights"", ""Grief Keep Within"", ""Stay, cruel Stay"" .It's really quite a mixed bag of sentiments and Chance is an expert at conveying them to you and to me.Don't miss out on this terrific lute song presentation, also featuring Paul Beier (American)an expert who plays a tasty lute.  He has also recorded a stunning disc with  Chance, M. Huggett, B. Dickey entitled : ""Con Gratia Et Maniera"", weird title but a totally engrossing recording.  Just hearing Bruce Dickey on cornet does it for me!EARLY MUSIC REVIEW, DECEMBER, 2013:  ""Danyel's songs represents the very best of this wonderful repertoire...Chance takes great pains to articulate every word beautifully...undoubted artistry.""MUSIC WEB INTERNATIONAL, January 2, 2014: ""These performances are very much aligned with the tradition of voice and lute...The gain, I suppose, is a greater sense of sheer intimacy, and other musicians have taken this path as well.  In that respect there are few better guides than Michael Chance. He has a feeling of awareness for Elizabethan and Stuart lyrics second to none.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U9JMTY2EJ53V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSPZ752#wasThisHelpful","R1U9JMTY2EJ53V","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three totally diverse personalities both in life and in character contribute to this highly entertaining recording.  EMMANUELE d'ASTORGA (1680-c.1757) , a self-taught composer who never held a musical post, managed to compose chamber cantatas that were very well liked in the 18th century, the STABAT  MATER (on this disc)  accounted for much of his popularity, that actually accounted for a veritable Astorga cult in the 19th century..  Many tales are included about Astorga's life style in the informative booklet that comes with this package.FRANCESCO DURANTE (1684-1755);  his prolific output makes him the most considerable Italian church music composer of the late Baroque, and he was a gifted and influential teacher; in fact Pergolesi was one of his students.  GIOVANNI BATTISTA PERGOLESI (1710-1736); no other composer has achieved so much of permanent value in a public career of barely four years.Though different were their lives, and contrasting their characters, they all had one thing in common: their affiliation to a locally defined manner of composing generally described by historians as the ""Neapolitan school"".  This designation refers to the fact that the Naples opera influenced greatly Oratorio and church music in the 18th century.  Tunes were taken from secular music; harmony was dominated by clear major-minor tonality.  Such characteristics are to be found throughout these three compositions in the Neapolitan style.Hengelbrock's unique, often offbeat, but always scholarly approached and researched, manner is refreshing in a musical world that too often has a 'sameness' about it, not only as to programming, but also as to manner of implementation,  This disc is a good example of originality both in content and performance.Hengelbrock's choruses are beyond excellent; balance is superb; all parts are clearly heard; sound quality with his penchant for using male altos creates a solid harmony at that level without the treble overwhelming the inner parts;  this makes for an incredibly rich and solid sound.  They sing expressively, all parts resonant and diction clear.  His soloists are usually taken from his Balthasar-Neumann Chorus.  Exception on this album is the soprano:  Ann Monoyios.The package is accompanied by an excellent booklet with pertinent information in English, and German.  This music is truly a joy to hear!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16ZQ825FSTNRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HC9A4A#wasThisHelpful","R16ZQ825FSTNRK","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This disc consists of 22 landmark selections from  Hesperion  XX's various programs of music of the 12th to 14th centuries.  Notable composers represented:  Alfonso X El Sabio, Guillame Dufay, Eustache Du Caurroy, Orlando Lasso, Francisco Guerrero, Christopher Tye and Cristobal De Morales;  several anonymous works included also.Several instrumental selections, various vocal combinations, but not enough to satisfy me.  The vocalists, although  quite skilled as one would expect from Savall's offerings, did not have much to contribute , except for Montserrat Figueras, soprano, whose singing combines lyrical spontaneity, grace and a certain melancholy quality in her superb renditions.The Ensemble ""La Capella Reial de Catalunya""  was featured in only two of the twenty two composition, which was a great disappointment to me, although perhaps not to everyone.  But for me, alas, this is  not a five star disc.  Also, the booklet, unlike Savall's usual packaging includes limited information about the music and no text whatsoever.  Booklet language is French, Spanish, German and English.  I did recognize several selections from other recordings that I own.

"If any of you recall the film of several years ago about Mozart entitled ""Amadeus"" in which the Emperor in responding to whether he liked Mozart's latest opera replied: ""too many notes"".  This came into my mind after wading through about half of this book.  The story fascinates for a while but nothing new occurs without paragraphs and paragraphs of repeated information reiterated by different characters.  It distressed me that I had  to skip and skim entire pages in order to move the action forward.  I ""hung in there"" to the end and wondered why I had bothered at all.However,  having been part of the Music School scene for many years I did appreciate the author's insight as to the inner passions and conflicts that can and do take place in this type of setting.

(unmeasured grief); ""Eyes Look No More"" (pessimism-affliction-hopelessness).;  love in all its forms and moods ""Coy Daphne Fled',  ""Drop not mine Eyes' and the more recorded songs by other singers:  ""Like as the lute delights"", 'Grief, keep within' , ""Stay Cruel Stay"".  It's really quite a mixed bag of emotions and Chance is an expert at conveying them to you and me.I reviewed this from a CD, not purchased from Amazon, because they haven't listed it in this format, and I was tired of waiting. so I ordered it from England where there are several dealers selling, not as inexpensive as the Marketplace, but I don't know if it will ever appear here.  Don't miss out on this wonderful recording also with Paul Beier, an expert (American) who plays a very tasty lute.  He has also recorded a stunning disc with Chance, Huggett and Dickey entitled:""Con Gratia Et Maniera"", a weird title but a totally interesting recording.  Just hearing Bruce Dickey on cornet does it for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3572C4AI0R2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUXQ2F6#wasThisHelpful","RY3572C4AI0R2","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""In the beginning was the Word''..Actually, in the beginning there was the voice, the instrument of communication, communicating to each other everything , in short, that which characterizes man's feelings.  And uniting all of this with music have come secular and religious works: chants, canticles, hymns, psalms, motets, cantatas, airs and songs.  Vocal music is a reflection of its time, crossing the centuries to reveal emotion, particularly its religious side in which it forms an obvious prayer.  Thus, on this recording which begins with Alfonso X. El Sabio all the way to Mozart and Haydn, the Vox Aeterna (Eternal voice)  speaks to us, moves us, making itself the intermediary of our own feelings.Jordi Savall and his various ensembles have shed new light year after year showing many works to their advantage.  In his quest for authenticity, rereading of manuscripts, the choice of instrumentation and his innovative interpretations, he has uncovered hidden treasures for all of us.  His recordings are astounding in their implementation and provide the listener with highly interesting aural experiences.There are 12 selections on this disc each of which is totally separated from each other as far as performers and composers.  I will list them because unfortunately Amazon does not bother to do so.  WHAT A SURPRISE!!!!1. ALFONSO X EL SABIO:Pero Cantigas De Loor in which all participate.  2.  GUILLAUME DUFAY: Veni Sancto Spirito featuring Monserrat Figueras, soprano and Kar Wessel countertenor  3..EL CANT DE LA SIBILLA  Sibiilla catalane  featuring Figueras and complete ensemble.  4..CRISTOBEL DE MORALES  Lectio II  Ensemble  5. FRANCISCO GUERRERO  Ave Maria soloists 2 sopranos, I male contralto, one countertenor, 2 tenors, 1 baritone and 1 BASS.  6.  TOMAS LUIS DE VICTORIA  O Magnum Mysterium  ensemble  7.  MONTEVERDI  Ave Maris stella  with 2 sopranos, 1 countertenor, 3 tenors, 1 baritone and 1 bass.  8.  CEREROLS  Missa pro defulnctis with 2 sopranos, 2 tenors, 2 baritones and one bass.  9.  CHARPENTIER Prelude to Salve Regina (instrumental) and Salve Regina with the magnificient voices of Gerard Lesne, ct., John Elwes, tenor and Josep Cabre baritone.  THIS SELECTION WAS OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY!!! 10.  BACH  BWV 1068 Instrumental (not my favorite Bach rendition)  11.  MOZART Requiem Aetermam  instrumental well-performed but again not my favorite Mozart delivery/  12.  HAYDN Seven Last words with vocal speaker; very impressive.This recording is a work of art though it is a compilation from other discs, but for the most part I liked the contents.  Very little information came with the recording.; only a booklet with the program listing with the participants and one page of introduction; in English, French, Spanish, German and Italian.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BY56XVD6XDE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000024JRB#wasThisHelpful","R2BY56XVD6XDE8","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This early release ( 1982-83) is entirely devoted to dual specialties by the ensemble Chanticleer from San Francisco:  THE RENAISSANCE  and CHRISTMAS.  The music  consists of holiday and sacred music drawn from the canons of DesPrez, Byrd, Di Lasso and others of this caliber.  Rather than the usual fare we are dealing here with more subdued texture and mood of chant or counterpoint as in De Lasso' s ""Resonet in laudibus"" glorifying the birth of Jesus.  This composition contains several sections that have distinct rhythmic shifts and complex countermelodies;  it expands in dimension with each listening.  Taverner's ""Kyrie"" implies the subtle majesty of a processional, the melody ascending in supplication.Two selections I particularly enjoyed:  William Byrd's ""Sing joyfully unto God"" a jubilant motet whose vocal lines dance to the text and climax in a trumpet-like fanfare before returning to the stately close;  AND Giovanni Nanino's ""Diffusa est gratia"" a sophisticated antiphon to the Virgin which sets its sensual psalm text with classic High Renaissance style and spirituality.However, what really caused me to buy this particular Chanticleer disc ( I have many)  was the quality of the singers, my main interests being the top voices that can be very harsh and overpowering in music of this type, but not these guys.  In both groups the lead top singers (countertenors) are Louis Botto and Randall Wong and they are SUPERB in every way; good blend, good sound, good interpretation;  the other singers are also high quality and though not all are present in each of the two groups it makes no difference for it's all wonderfully sung.  This first group has 12 singers and the second group has ten singers.If you are an Early Music lover don't miss out on this very fine recording; who knows how long it will be available????But keep in mind that this is not your usual Christmas Fare!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R298ON8YQ5GAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003VV8#wasThisHelpful","R298ON8YQ5GAC","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Orlando de Lassus (1532-1594) was one of the most prolific and versatile composers of the High Renaissance.  He excelled in every branch of vocal music, sacred and secular;  his numerous compositions included French, German and Italian polyphonic songs, about 60 Masses, four Passions, over 100 Magnificat settings and about 500 motets which are generally regarded as his finest works.  His religious writings were serious, meditative and almost somber, as witness his moving setting of SEVEN PENITENTIAL PSALMS (an excellent recording of this work is by the Hilliard Ensemble 1985 EMI).This astonishing work LAGRIME DI SAN PIETRO (the tears of St.Peter)may be one  of his greatest compositions.  It is a setting of a twenty verse poem by the Italian poet, Luigi Tansillo (Pub. 1560) to which Lassus added a final motet.  The poet Tansillo imagines the grief beyond grief that Peter feels after he has actively denied Christ three times before the cock crows;  an intensely emotional thought for contemplation!  The final motet is the response of Christ while on the cross to St. Peter, the final words being:  ""And though the outward pain be great, the internal agony is graver still when I find you ungrateful"".  Thus for St. Peter there is no ecstasy following his agony.This work is Lassus' swansong, for at this point in his life he was suffering from depression and frequent bouts of 'melancholy', a condition which involved many physical and/or emotional manifestations..  In addition, he was much concerned about his declining health; understandable given the fact that his sense of musical mischief and taste for scandalous subject matter, abundant, especially in his French secular music, may have put him in a penitential mood as he came closer to his demise.  This final composition reflects an unclothed confessional manner as well as an architecture that reveals a series of devotional gestures.  It is as if Lassus in this modern day was driving in the country and saw one of the many road signs posted here and there that say: PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD!As one listens to this work there is a sense of sameness of style; there are no sharp edges of sound.  The musical phrases echo the natural rhythms of speech, which do not include florid embellishments or melisma.  Lines of text are repeated for emphasis, and are sung antiphonally (between alternating groups of singers) where it is appropriate. As compared to other Lassus compositions it seems bland and I guess I miss the occasional touch of humor that appears in many other of his compositions, both religious and sacred, though in this work it would indeed be difficult to find a spot for any form of levity.The word Gallicantus means song or cock crow as derived from the ancient Monastic office held just before dawn.  It evokes the renewal of life offered by the coming day. Gallicantus is a seven voice all-male choir (most of the time); their members come with a wealth of experience in this genre of consort singing.  They as well as their director, Gabriel Crouch, are bound by a shared love that draws unifying themes within diverse repertoire, a difficult task to be sure!  To their advantage they have in the ensemble two very fine countertenors, namely Marc Chambers, who possesses a non-invasive but solid soprano sound, and David Allsopp, who has a refined and elegant lower register.  This, of course, adds greatly to the overall blend and balance of parts by not allowing the top line to disturb the polyphonic balance.This is the fourth recording by this group which I have been following since the first disc released in 2009.  All are listed on Amazon and I have reviewed all of them.  They have given me an inordinate amount of pleasure.

"(re-release of a 1997 DVD at a much cheaper price)Even after three centuries, the music of Monteverdi glows with the passionate genius of a musical prophet.  He was far ahead of his day in his conception of music as a dramatic, expressive art, and in the realization of that conception.  The score of L'Orfeo, first printed in 1609, records the events of its first performance at the Mantuan court in 1607. A unique aspect of the score is the wealth of information about the development of the 'continuo orchestra'.  It is this combination - the human voice of Orfeo and the 'heavenly lyre' which accompanies him - which  established opera as an art form that continues to fascinate us today.  But beyond the enchantment of Orfeo's 'heavenly lyre', is the immediacy and truth of his human voice that rivets our attention and moves our hearts.The opera begins with the character 'La Musica' the allegorical embodiment of music, presents herself to the princely company and announces a drama in which the power of music will occupy the center of the stage; it is the story of Orpheus who conquered the Underworld with his lyre and his singing.  As this 'fable in music'(as Monteverdi called it) unfolds, we are exposed to the entire gamut of emotions, from the most euphoric to the most dejected, presented in musical language that is perhaps closer to human speech the recitative has ever been, before or since.The story of Orpheus has been done and redone by many composers through the centuries, although it remains essentially the same: Orfeo;s beloved Euridice dies and Orpheus goes into the Underworld to find her. He is escorted there by ""La Speranza"" (Hope), who leaves him at the gates of the Underworld to be met by Charon, the boatman who ferries him (albeit while sleeping) across the river to the realm of Pluto, where he pleads for Euridice's life. Moved by the singer's lament, Proserpine, Pluto's wife, convinces Pluto to allow Orpheus to take Euridice back, but with the condition that he not look back at her while she follows him,  or she will return to Death (what a silly condition!).  And, of course at her pleas for him to look at her, he losses her permanently.  Bu t in this version  Apollo, the father of Orpheus, comes down and invites his son to ascend with him into Heaven, where he will know joy and peace forever!  Not bad I Say! (I prefer Gluck's version in which Orpheus gets another chance and succeeds in getting Euridice returned to him).All performers acquit themselves skillfully with the singers providing excellent characterizations, but why not for they are mostly all experienced in this genre:  ORFEO-John Mark Ainsley, EURIDICE-Jaunita Lascarro, LA MESSANGIERA-Brigitte Balleys, APOLLO -Russel Smythe, LA MUSICA -David Cordier, LA SPERANZA-Michael Chance, CARONTE-Mario Luperi.  Tragicomedia, the accompanying ensemble, also experienced, perform neatly and accurately.  The choral group Concerto Palatine provide spirited choral renditions throughout the  opera.  An intense and refreshing performance by an expert cast sustained by the lead John Mark Ainsley  directed with obvious affection by Stephen Stubbs, provides us with some great Monteverdi music.  The beautifully styled, evocative stage production, rich with Pierre Audi's trademark accentuates the solemn serenity of Monteverdi's most famous work to create a moving and timeless audio-visual experience.Sung in Italian with English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Dutch subtitles","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F772SP2HAEKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4Q6QA4#wasThisHelpful","R2F772SP2HAEKK","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOT YOUR USUAL CHRISTMAS CHEER, but entertaining nonetheless!LIONHEART is one of AMERICA'S leading ensembles of vocal chamber music.  There are six male singers: one countertenor, two tenors, two baritones and one bass, all of whom sing individually with skill and intensity.  As an ensemble they perform with perfection with superb balance and blend.  Their diction both in the old English and the Latin is flawless as they render these highly interesting Medieval English Carols and Motets.  I didn't even need the liner notes to know what they were singing.While Christmas recordings these days lean heavily on Renaissance and Baroque works wanting to create an atmosphere that is quaint and warmly inviting, Lionheart herein presents a program focused on Medieval England that contains Hymns, Carols and Motets that go back to the 13th century.  They are sung in Latin and Old English, all of which is translated in the liner notes which are excellent and explanatory.  This is not simply a Christmas program, but a tour of the twelve days of Christmas, with pieces celebrating the various feasts and other commemorations that occur between Christmas and the Feast of Epiphany on Jan. 6.As I have indicated in my heading, it is not all seasonal cheeriness.  For example:  Two songs for the Feast of St. Stephen, honoring the first Christian martyr; Carols for the Feast of the Holy Innocents recall Herod's slaughter of children; and the colorful ""Seynt Thomas Honour We"" pays tribute to Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and commemorates his murder by knights of King Henry II on December 29, 1170.  One must acknowledge that this is obviously not standard holiday fare, but a glimpse if traditions and attitudes of a distant era.  But having said all of this, I hasten to add that most of the music is indeed celebratory, just not in the ecstatic, commercial style of modern carols, rather in a more devotional and reverent way.There are some that you will find familiar, arranged somewhat more creatively than one usually hears; one such carol is ""Lully lulla"" which enchanted me in its implementation; just exquisitely presented.  The arrangements are quite unique and display a very arresting variety of techniques.  Sometimes small vocal ensembles begin to sound the same and  often it's because arranger/s seem to lack inspiration or whatever it takes to be able to present new ideas when confronted with a small ensemble that sings an extensive repertoire.  That's not a problem on this recording.WHAT A GREAT LISTEN THIS IS FOR THE EARLY MUSIC LOVER AND PARTICULARLY THE CONNOISSEUR OF MEDIEVEL MUSIC!NEW YORK TIMES-Allan Kozinn:  ""Lionheart's vocal blend is as finely calibrated as ever, and the singers perform this repertory not as antiquarian curiosities but in a way that makes it sound vital and of the present.""KANSAS CITY STAR-Mickey Coalwell:  ""Lionheart's accomplishments appear almost miraculous. Perfect blend, tone production, phrasing and a host of dynamic subtleties characterize their singing.  Lionheart embodies the best qualities of the early-music movement...""","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBCBF4P5AJFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AYLIQ#wasThisHelpful","R2WBCBF4P5AJFJ","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DE'LICIOUS, DE'LIGHTFUL, DE'LOVELY!  SINGPHONIKER'S CHRISTMAS CONTRIBUTION.Those of you looking for something new and different, check out Die Singphoniker's warm-hearted and clear-eyed performance of Christmas favorites hailing from all over Europe from Catalonia through Norway with , naturally,  many  songs from Germany.  Interspersed throughout the disc are three gently played harp solos by the skilled fingers of Irmgard Gorzawski.Die Singphoniker is a six-man vocal group which has been in existence for 25 years and has made nearly 30 CD's.  They have a wide-ranging repertoire from Gregorian chant to pop music.  Unlike groups such as Chanticleer and King's Singers their vocal make-up is more bottom-heavy having two tenors at the top rather than the two altos that the two former groups have.  However, the two tenors also double up on the alto when needed.  On this particular disc there are two guest basses in addition to the harpist.  The singers are:  Alfons Brandl (tenor); Hubert Nettinger (alto/tenor)on this disc for the most part sings in the alto range and I must commend him for his ability to switch from falsetto to chest voice even in mid-phrase, with ease and without a hint of a gear-change AND with a lovely tone quality on both sides of the divide!; Ludwig Thomas (baritone); Michael Mantaj (bass-baritone); Christian Schmidt (bass); Willi Pirzer (bass); Berno Scharpf (baritone); and Irmgard the harpist.The program consists of some familiar carols and some not so familiar, but all are arranged to please the ear and even the ones you might know are refreshingly unique.  The only one that does not seem to fit the overall plan is the American carol by Jester Hairston ""Mary's Boy Child"".  And there is one word change in the last line that is major because it changes the entire meaning of Christmas; it is sung as 'Man will live forever more because it's Christmas Day'  and it should read 'Man will live forever more because of Christmas Day.  I don't think it detracts from the recording, but it is noticeable to those of us who believe that mankind will survive because of the birth of Christ.  I think it was simply a mistake in the translation and I heard it and forgot it!Some of the notable carols are:  ""The Green, Shining Tree"": Edward Greig, Norway;  ""O Sanctissima"" ( O Most Holy, Italy);  ""Il est ne, le devin Enfant"" (He is born, the Holy Child-France); ""Quanno Nascetto "" (When the Child is born,Catalan) note the whistling in this one, very well done;  ""We three kings of Orient Are"" (England);  ""Vom Himmel hoch"" (From Heaven on High) Germany.  In truth all of the carols are delightful to hear and I especially enjoyed the unfamiliar examples.Overall the CD is interesting, well-performed and well recorded AND highly entertaining.  For the most part the song material is unique, and refreshing; the familiar carols are cleverly arranged and the unfamiliar carols charming.  The booklet notes are translated from German to English.Once you have heard this group you will no doubt be seeking out more of their recordings. Two that I have enjoyed and reviewed are :""Orlando di Lasso-lieder, chansons and madrigals"";  ""Hymnus-Orlando di Lasso"".  This is all great fare for the Early Music Lover!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P72NG5K23WBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BK5392#wasThisHelpful","R2P72NG5K23WBL","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE SEVEN PENITENTIAL PSALMS OF ORLANDO DI LASSUS WITH ALL THEIR GRANDEUR AND UNIQUENESS FORM ONE OF THE GREAT PEAKS OF 16TH CENTURY MUSIC.The ancient tradition of penitential prayer goes back to the early Middle Eastern civilization; it is deeply rooted in Jewish religious practice, from which it was adopted into Christianity. Duke Albrecht of Bavaria commissioned these psalms and in fact liked them so much that for a time he reserved them for his ear alone!  AND expressed his gratitude to Lassus in a very practical way by presenting him with several thousand gulden, enough to pay for Lassus's large house in Munich.The curious fate and unique character of Lassus's Psalms ensured that music history never lost sight of them throughout the centuries.  Such theorists as E.T.A. Hoffmann and A.F.J.Thibaut praised  this work 'for its simplicity, loftiness and majesty of expression', and stated 'that they were at a loss to imagine how even today these psalms could be better set to music.'  And with that statement I heartily agree!The penitential psalms are nos. 6, 31,37,50,101,129 and 142 in the enumeration of the Vulgate, and nos. 6,32,38,51,102,130 and 143 in most Protestant versions of the Bible. There is in the accompanying booklet a complete description of this work from which I have drawn some specifics.The performance mandates a small choice ensemble of handpicked virtuosos, capable of rendering every nuance of Lassus's expressive music, and the furthest remove from the massed choirs and giant orchestras of some performances in modern times.  The Hilliard Ensemble along with the Kees Boeke Consort fulfill this mandate to the letter, and beautifully so!The outstanding singers are:  countertenors=MICHAEL CHANCE, David James, Tenors=ROGERS COVEY CRUMP,John Potter, Leigh Nixon, Philip Cave, CHARLES DANIELS; baritone=PAUL HILLIER, Gordon Jones; bass=David Beavan.  Consort: viola da gamba=Kees Boeke, Charles Medlam; cornett=BRUCE DICKEY; tenor trombone Charles Toet; Bass trombone Richard Lister; theorbe STEPHRN STUBBS.  A really superior group of performers. (recorded in 1986)The expression on this disc is powerfully enthralling and quite consoling.  This music truly conveys the spirit of penitence; the emotions of a strong and noble soul.  With great sensitivity does Lassus bring to life the soul-searching that many of us experience in our lives.The booklet includes pertinent information and complete text translation in English, German and French.  The present price on this listing is very reasonable.  And the price does go up and down constantly, so if you like it today this listing has the lowest price; there are not many available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S6NP9E3A9WW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FIDNLA#wasThisHelpful","R2S6NP9E3A9WW0","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AN OVERALL MOOD OF DARKNESS PREVAILS IN THIS RECORDING DRIVEN BY THE TEXT, BUT MUCH OF THE MUSIC BELIES THE MOOD!In 2008 NMC records produced a five disc set entitled NMC Songbook which contained the works of several of Britain's new composers.  Joseph Phibbs's selection ""The Moon's Funeral"" appeared on one of the discs and it is included on this one.  Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, NMC's Debut Discs Ambassador states:""In a world where composers face so many hurdles to ensure their music is heard, NMC's unwavering commitment to them and to building an unrivalled catalog of the UK's classical music output means that composers are not overlooked...""After hearing this recording I am grateful that Joseph Phibbs was not overlooked, for his music is refreshing and creative showing an awareness of all that is needed to put together this program of chamber music involving both instruments and voices.Though his music contains a definitive British flavor that can be compared to the likes of Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten, it transcends any components of nationality - its language is universal.  When listening to contemporary music one must concentrate fully; it is usually so different from what many of us perceive as music, but through the years I have learned that repeated hearings frequently bring out the true worth of the music, OR NOT! One example of success for me was a composition by Alexander Goehr ""The Death of Moses"".  One of my unsuccessful attempts to adjust and enjoy a composition was the opera ""Taverner"" by Peter Maxwell Davies; I finally gave up on that one!The first work on this recording is instrumental(piano, flute, violin and cello):""FLEX"" demonstrates absolute virtuosity by the performers.  Despite the presence of dissonance in Phibbs's music along with its far-out harmonies, he manages to create moments of lyrical loveliness that might rival some of the conventional masterworks.  His instrumental textures are unique and his rhythmic design is ably conveyed by the ensemble.  The dance-like movement of the piece would make an excellent modern dance scenario.Two songs from SHADES OF NIGHT sung by tenor, Ben Alden, accompanied on piano by Andrew Plant:  ""Sleep my body, sleep my ghost"" which is a commentary on the mounting anxiety in Europe during the months before war broke out.  Thus uncertainty and fear is depicted throughout the piano accompaniment, which is played skillfully by Plant.  The second song ""Hush-a-ba, birdie"" is a traditional Scottish lullaby, and is set here like an imaginary folk song.  Alden sings with confidence, clear diction, perceptive phrasing and with the correct emotional involvement.THE CANTICLE OF THE ROSE is the centerpiece of the disc; it is an extended song cycle for soprano and string quartet set to verses by Dame Edith Sitwell.  Phibbs's music in this work is compelling, sometimes 'jarring' and occasionally painful to my ears, but the text is by turns exciting, depressing, morbid and maniacal, so the sounds are true to the text.  However, for the most part, it held my interest; the six movements were varied in tempo drastically at times; thus my psyche went back and forth from highly engaging to quite dull. One major obstacle to enjoyment has to do with the very fine soprano who had an almost impossible to sing part which she managed to sing magnificently, the problem being that the diction much of the time was lost because of the character of the music.  I tend to think that if one listens to this composition and mentally places the soprano on an instrumental basis as one of the five participants and is not  concerned with the text, this work becomes quite palatable and indeed enjoyable.  The strings are marvelous and perform this very complex music perfectly.  The third time I listened I discarded the text and found it to be most entertaining and marveled again at how superb were the performers.FROM SHORE TO SHORE combines countertenor, Michael Chance with guitarist James Boyd  It sets a series of old and new poems on the subject of the sea.  The essence of the centrality of the sea to British and Irish cultures is explored in this song cycle. The text was extracted from the works of the American poet Sara Teasdale and British writer Nicolas Heiney, both of whom committed suicide at  a young age.  This work was composed for Chance, one of the world's great countertenors and one whose talent for the 'song' and word commentaries is unquestionable.  Take note that though his songs are difficult, no word is lost; he is a master of communication.  He is adroitly and sensitively accompanied by Boyd, a skilled guitarist.  Chance sings these songs with undiminished eloquence and beauty of tone; the ethereal quality of his voice is ideal for Phibbs's music.  He sings the final selection on this recording ""The Moon's Funeral"" an exuberant portrait of a warped and rejected nature;  Plant is the accompanist.In the brief work AGEA, in which the musical vowels of George Vass's name (for whom this work was dedicated), Phibbs makes us aware of how much he knows about the musical capabilities and effects of the stringed instruments.  Their performance is beyond belief when one perceives the complexity of this music.  Kudos to them!For me this work will take many more listenings before I completely settle in and eke out all their is to obtain, but the music is certainly worth the time and effort and the performers MORE THAN WORTH THE TIME. The package includes good information and explanations by the composer, Phibbs. The text is also included, all in English, of course.THE SUNDAY TIMES: ""Phibbs's sheer accomplishment as a composer is unmistakable here.  Every idea is telling, every phrase beautiful.""BBC MUSIC MAGAZINE, September, 2013:  ""The relatively Spartan textures of these pieces are more convincing than some of Phibbs's writing for larger ensembles.  These works draw you in with a well-judged pacing of their sometimes frenetic activity and mesmerizing stillness.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NWY50OIRTUGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQ71QG2#wasThisHelpful","R3NWY50OIRTUGQ","A1UBBIDQTDDF79","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UBBIDQTDDF79?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"And so it begins...At the core of Beckett, Blake, and Cole's relationship is absolute trust and devotion. They may not be related by blood, but they're true brothers in every since of the word, helping each other to feel like they belong and giving one another a way to be more than they were.Through the battles of loneliness, fear, and pain, the brothers have stood by each other, never leaving anyone behind, believing in one another and paving the way for them to survive their messed up pasts and maddening presents.The Quiet OneThe Broken OneThe Reckless OneAll three damaged in irreparable ways but somehow moving forward out of sheer will and desperation. Blake's issues leave him seeking solitude away from the light, shrouding himself in darkness in order to keep the monsters at bay. Cole loses himself in his psyche in order to endure his tormented memories and shield himself from the pain. Beckett is clearly their leader and he's the perfect choice because he goes out of his way to take care of those closest to him and do the kind of things that may not make him moral and honest but it definitely illustrates how he protects his own at all costs to himself.The brotherhood Beckett, Blake, and Cole share is one that was established early on in order to survive foster care, but it continues because they willingly fight in each other's corner. Nothing is more important than protecting their bond and being available at all times so they never have to endure anything alone. And, this idea is meticulously illustrated throughout Poughkeepsie Begins.Regardless of the situation, everyone chooses a path to follow and Debra Anastasia provides readers with how the Poughkeepsie brothers decided which way to go and for what reasons, allowing us to understand what led Beckett to a life of power and crime; Blake to his music, and Cole to his faith.Never Alone. Brothers Forever. No one gets left alone.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15THCNAL5UM4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017RNBRRM#wasThisHelpful","R15THCNAL5UM4R","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A life for a life. Thatâ€™s the way of the mob, and unfortunately, thatâ€™s a deal that Logan knows too well, and itâ€™s an idea he refuses to allow to touch Elle because regardless of how quickly their relationship progressed, sheâ€™s his, and heâ€™s not willing to sacrifice Elle for anyone, including himself.The stakes are high in the conclusion of Kim Karrâ€™s The Tainted Love Duet, and the outcome could go either way because there are a lot of players in the game, both known and unknown, who serve as a threat to the happiness that Logan and Elle seek. The truth is definitely not what it seems, and until Logan can unravel the clues and be released from the sins of his past, both Logan and Elle can be crushed, not just by the acts of others, but also from their own fears and anger.I knew that Logan and Elle were going to have to overcome a lot of obstacles to truly be together in the end, but I never imagined all of the secrets, lies, threats, and danger that would become a constant as the days continued, and Logan worked to secure their safety once and for all.Kim Karr weaves a meticulous story of suspense, passion, and heart stopping action. Thereâ€™s a lot on the line for both Logan and Elle, including their relationship, and readers get to see firsthand what and why theyâ€™re willing to risk it all for those they love.Logan has intrigued me since the very first meeting, and he becomes even more dynamic in Crush. His dual life had the power to defeat him, but his role as protector helps him to not drown in his mistakes and do his best to ensure that he has a future with the woman he loves. I loved watching his mind work as he struggled to understand the truth behind the lies and deception. Loganâ€™s strength and confidence allowed him to keep fighting even when the world around him was turned on his side, and he was forced to deal with events and actions that would have conquered a lesser man. Elle comes into her own as well in Crush. She uses Loganâ€™s love and strength to help her unleash the warrior inside her and not allow the fear to consume her. Itâ€™s not easy for her but as long as she knows Logan has her back, she pushes forward.Iâ€™ve always loved Kim Karrâ€™s writing, but her Tainted Love Duet truly proves how gifted of a writer she is. Thereâ€™s never a dull moment in Logan and Elleâ€™s story and readers are on edge throughout the entire text wondering how the actions and truths of others will affect them, and if theyâ€™ll make it through all of the danger that threatens to destroy them.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VAGQML1QT9MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EBIZMA#wasThisHelpful","R1VAGQML1QT9MR","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Staying on Course is the perfect title for Devon and Bryceâ€™s conclusion because it implies that there is a definite path theyâ€™re journeying down, but that the road is sometimes tenuous due to external circumstances, forcing both Devon and Bryce to remain strong despite the distance, the jealousy, the miscommunication, and the time spent apart.Devonâ€™s character will both endear and frustrate readers due to some of her actions and her inability to think clearly at times and see the big picture of Bryceâ€™s devotion to her and their life plan. But sheâ€™s inexperienced when it comes to relationships, and Bryce has been the object of her affection for so many years that Iâ€™m sure the reality that he is actually hers is a bit hard to grasp at times. One thing I absolutely love about Devon is that she does everything she can to be her own person and follow her dreams/passions despite her insecurities. Sheâ€™s so talented and a career is important to her, which keeps her in check for the most part because thatâ€™s one path she will follow until the end.Bryceâ€™s devotion to Devon and the love he has for her is truly amazing. He knows he messed up in the past and heâ€™s aware of whatâ€™s at stake and refuses to do anything to jeopardize his relationship. With every word and action, readers can tell how much Devon means to Bryce and how much he wants to give her the world and show her that sheâ€™s his.Quinn brought humor into the story and helped ease the tension on more than one occasion. I love how much of a straight shooter she is; sheâ€™s Devonâ€™s rock and she proves that she deserves the title of best friend on numerous occasions.I've always loved how Ahren Sandersâ€™ writing flows; it feels almost seamless, and it's quite easy to become absorbed with her stories because there's no unnecessary content. I will admit that Devon kind of annoyed me at the beginning, but then I had to remember her age and what she'd already been through with Bryce, which made it easier to accept and see it from her perspective. The angst wasnâ€™t over done, but there's always insecurities and issues with a long distance relationship and there can be outside forces threatening it, so the drama was necessary to prove how solid Bryce and Devon are and what theyâ€™re willing to do to prove it.Staying the Courseâ€™s Epilogue is perfect because it shows how all of the couples readers have grown to love end up, and because Quinn and Nate are in the book so much, it's awesome to see their future lives.Bryce and Quinnâ€™s story is packed full of emotion, love, and steam. The love they have for one another resonates off of the pages with every physical and emotional encounter. By the time the story ends, thereâ€™s no doubt that they belong together and are worth the pain and heartache because their happiness begins and ends with each other.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K3T96BHH5XYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0185XC4DY#wasThisHelpful","R3K3T96BHH5XYF","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Levi â€œPainterâ€ Brooks is the epitome of loyal biker brother. He has his brothersâ€™ backs, putting the club first since he patched into the Reapers MC. The reason he can play this role is because he doesnâ€™t have anything to lose; his choices donâ€™t matter to anyone outside of the club because he doesnâ€™t get close with anyone not in that world.The only thing Melanie Tucker has in common with Painter is the fact that she puts those she loves ahead of herself, even when it ends up hurting her more than anything else. The world Melanie lives in is nothing like the dark and gritty motorcycle life, but that doesnâ€™t stop her from wanting to take a ride with Painter and see what they could possibly be.Reaperâ€™s Fall is the perfect title for Painter and Melanieâ€™s story because regardless of how much Painter knows that heâ€™s not good enough for Melanie and that he doesnâ€™t know if he can offer her anything more than his body, he canâ€™t help but fall for her sweetness, her strength, and her ability to see through his bulls**t. But Painter also takes a fall for his club, changing the dynamics of his relationship with Melanie and spending a significant amount of time trying to make amends for the choices he felt he had to make.Because Painter and Melanieâ€™s story spans a number of years, there are a great deal of hardships that they must contend withâ€¦frustration and hurt are two emotions that always seem to surround Painter and Melanie as they try to work through the obstacles that threaten to destroy any chance they have of truly being together.What I love most about Joanna Wyldeâ€™s Reapers MC series is that she marvelously weaves two story lines together â€“ one that deals with the ups and downs of the hero/heroineâ€™s relationship and one that focuses on the threats to the club and the path that the members must go on in order to protect the brotherhood. Both situations occur simultaneously and have a direct impact on each other, which doesnâ€™t feel forced or disjointed, which is important when moving forward a plotline that began with book one and needs to continue according to that timeline.I never felt that Em was the girl for Painter, so I didnâ€™t have a difficult time with his feelings for Melanie. Painter needed someone outside of the club to understand how his recklessness could cost him more than his own life, and regardless of how strong Melanie is Painterâ€™s choices definitely altered both of their lives in big ways.Reaperâ€™s Fall is another fantastic biker book in the Reapers MC series. Readers get to catch up with past couples as well as see how the Silver Bastards are doing. There are clues to who the next couples will be in both of Wyldeâ€™s MC series and with the introduction of two feisty women, it will be interesting to see how the bikers handle them and what kind of trouble it causes.A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VEGVTVKP05OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KFM0#wasThisHelpful","R3VEGVTVKP05OI","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Command â€“ itâ€™s such a fitting title for the completion of Scott and Harlowâ€™s story. So much has changed since they first got together, not only with their relationship but also with the club, and all of those changes could either make a lasting positive impact or send everyone involved spiraling down the wrong path.Scott â€“ that man has gone through hell and fire to set the club on the right path and also to prove to Harlow how much he loves her and wants to take care of her. Nina Levine brings a whole other side of Scott out in Command. Readers have seen him be an a**hole and a protector, but what he does for Harlow and those he loves in this story proves that underneath the tough and gritty biker is a man who wants to do right by his woman and makes their relationship a priority because it means everything to him.Levine does a great job of illustrating Harlowâ€™s struggles after the loss of her baby. The emptiness and grief Harlow feels is perfectly illustrated and so is her motivation to get her life back on track and show Scott that sheâ€™s ready to move forward. Readers definitely see Harlowâ€™s feistiness resurface and her skill at reading situations and holding her regardless of whatâ€™s happening is what makes her the perfect partner for Scott.Storm MC has been a work in progress throughout the last couple books of the series. Attempting to rebuild a club when not all of its members agree with the new direction the club is going and isnâ€™t afraid to voice that opinion and do some underhanded things to exact retribution doesnâ€™t help make the club a brotherhood again. But regardless of what Scott has to do to turn the club around, heâ€™ll do it as long as he has brothers at his back and a clear view on what heâ€™s dealing with in terms of the issues in front of him.Scott and Harlowâ€™s relationship took a hit with the loss of their child and the club took a hit as well, but both of those bonds were worked through in Command and hopefully, Scott and Harlow and the rest of the Storm MC can have a bit of peace after the tumultuous journey it took to get there.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R338Z6QTN3WW87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013S4KBDU#wasThisHelpful","R338Z6QTN3WW87","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nothing Venturedâ€¦Nothing GainedThis motto has served Colin Sloan well as a venture capitalist, and heâ€™s hoping heâ€™ll have the same success with his biggest risk of all - his heart.Elle Mariano made a promise to herself and her son to not take unnecessary risks and to put the needs of her son before her own. But Elleâ€™s longing for the sinfully sexy, tatted, and tempting man cannot be suppressed, driving her to do her best to stay in the present and not hold his past or her past against Colin or herself.I absolutely adore Lauren Blakelyâ€™s Sinful Nights series. Itâ€™s the perfect mix of suspense, mystery, and steam. I love that each story continues the plot line of the first book, unraveling secrets and revealing truths, which only further complicates the relationships explored in the series. As each book ends, I feel like readers get closer and further away from the ultimate reveal, only increasing our desire to get the answers we need, so that all couples can finally move on with their lives and not be stuck in a perpetual game of whodunit.Three books in and I think Iâ€™ve found my favorite book boyfriend of the series. The fact that Colinâ€™s worked for everything heâ€™s achieved, starting with his sobriety, adds to his appeal. Heâ€™s made poor choices and has suffered their consequences, but Colinâ€™s persevered, and even if it takes awhile for Elle to truly accept Colin for the man he is not for the man he was, their relationship may have a fighting chance to be more than no strings sex and give both Colin and Elle what they both have been longing for - each other.Once again Blakely ends Colin and Elleâ€™s story with a startling revelation - one that will be explored in Michaelâ€™s book as he attempts to seek out a woman from his past - someone who could change so much more than just Michaelâ€™s relationship status.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JNX4LF68GK8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142ZNO7E#wasThisHelpful","R1JNX4LF68GK8L","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just One Taste is an interesting title for Eric and Deenaâ€™s novella because those words have very different meanings for the Dom and submissive in training.For Eric, one taste of Deenaâ€™s body is all he needs to know sheâ€™s the woman he wants, and as long as heâ€™s patient and can tear down some of her walls, sheâ€™ll be his to indulge in forever.For Deena, all she wants is a tasteâ€¦a physical release from a bad boy who will please her physically and leave her emotions intact. Sheâ€™s not looking for a lifelong commitment; her divorce left her scarred and broken, unwilling to put her heart on the line again.But regardless of how much Deena tries to top from the bottom and sees Eric as a forever kind of man, not the bad boy she needs, Ericâ€™s mission is to indulge and command, giving and taking until Deena finally sees that she can have the best of both worlds as Ericâ€™s submissive and lover.I have to admitâ€¦I didnâ€™t understand why Eric felt so deeply for Deena right from the start. Donâ€™t get me wrongâ€¦I completely understand why Deena shut down after her divorce, not wanting intimacy with anyone, but I couldnâ€™t understand her way of thinking when it came to a bad boy vs. a good man because even giving herself over to a man only interested in sex can do more harm than good. But as Eric takes the steps to prove to Deena the type of man he is and she starts to let down her walls and consider not walking away, readers are able to see who Deena really is behind the fear and heartbreak and understand why Eric is willing to risk everything, especially his job and his heart.Just One Taste is a fairly quick read with plenty of sass and steam. Eric is an incredible man, Dom, and chef who deserves everything his heart desires and even though Deena is a bit closed minded and insensitive, she seems to be who he wants and the journey to get there is quite the showdown of two stubborn and controlling people who in their heart knows they want more than just one taste!A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHTP3J2SGFVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015UK1DM8#wasThisHelpful","R2MHTP3J2SGFVR","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some Sort of Crazy is a realistic look at how two people can seemingly want very different things in their lives, but somehow, due to their connection...what they give and get from one another, they can't imagine not having each other in their lives and what that leads to is a whole lot of sex...a significant amount of growing up...and heroine who just might have found the live she's always wanted by veering off her planned path.Readers will absolutely relate to Natalie Nixon and her sensible and responsible lifestyle; she thrives on order and control, stubbornly following all of her decisions until the very end, which in most cases allows her to follow her dreams and her passion, but in one aspect of her life, itâ€™s slowly impinging on her happiness.Enter Miles HaasMiles is everything that Natalie is not - he lives for fun, never allowing feelings into play, focusing, instead, on living free and easy with as many women and good times he can pack into the hours of the day.Both Natalie and Miles seem unwilling to bend or change, refusing to acknowledge that their sex only agreement isnâ€™t enough. Because regardless of their minds telling them anything more between them is impossible, their bodies and their hearts seem to disagree, causing Natalie and Miles to wonder if cataclysmically altering their lives will give them the happiness they thought they already had or if it will not only mess up a friendship but destroy any hope of a future with anyone else, even for fun.I absolutely love Melanie Harlowâ€™s characters; theyâ€™re definitely flawed, but they also epitomize the various types of personalities and attitudes that exist in our society. Sometimes people refuse to see whatâ€™s right in front of them, never acknowledging that their life plan might actually be a mistake and that everything they thought was wrong for them is actually what they need to feel alive.Some Sort of Crazy is a fantastic story about giving into what your body craves even if your head doesnâ€™t agree; itâ€™s about freeing yourself from a plan that doesnâ€™t seem to end the way you wanted and finding the courage to make a decision that may completely upend your life, but it will be one hell of a journey on the way.Everyone needs a little crazy some time!A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VDEX24LS5A02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HOM3NU#wasThisHelpful","R2VDEX24LS5A02","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Triple Nipple FudgeStroke n PokeClam JamNibble My NutsEven if youâ€™re not really a fan of ice cream, like me, I could totally see myself diving into one of Ryleigh Phillipsâ€™ smexy concoctions and licking the bowl clean;) Because anyone who can come up with interesting dessert combinations with names that give them a sexual undertone definitely deserves to be appreciated.Boy did I need this sweet, sexy, and hilarious read. It has the perfect blend of light hearted comedy, steamy scenes, and a group of girl friends who have each other's backs regardless of who or what enters their lives.Ryleigh is a fantastic heroine who is in a class all of her own because sheâ€™s not afraid to be herself and express her individuality through her clothes, her attitude, and her business. She hasnâ€™t always been this way, which a lot of readers can relate to, but she decided that who she is, is exactly who she deserves to be and to hell with anyone who disagrees.And then thereâ€™s the lickable pair of men who seem to want Ryleigh in every possible sense of the word. Cameron and Hunter are so damn sexy, and they both have a lot to offer her regardless of how different they are. But Ryleigh can only see herself licking every inch of one of them, which is exactly what she ends up doing in the most delicious ways.I love romantic comedies, but sometimes, I have a hard time enjoying them because they are a little light on the humor or the romance.

"Truth and Justice...two powerful and valuable ideas that are, at times, taken for granted, and in Unlawful Justice, readers are shown first hand what happens when there are differing opinions about how those two ideals should be carried out.The title itself is extremely paradoxical because at face value, it doesn't seem like justice is served when illicit means are used, but in some cases, the only way to get to the honest truth is by going perhaps a little around the law because sometimes there's more to the truth than meets the eye.K Langston and KC Lynn tell a powerful story about racism, an eye for an eye, and the consequences of reactionary actions. Amidst the turmoil and degradation, there is also a love story that allows readers to keep hope even when it seems like there's none to be found in the little town where the story takes place.Olivia Bradshaw and Grayson Taylor embody the idea of tolerance down to their core, but their faith is tested numerous times throughout Unlawful Justice, so much so that Grayson wants to take justice into his own hands and eradicate the evil and hatred that has embroiled the lives of almost every citizen in Harmony Falls.â€œSeek the truth and you will find justice.â€Those are definitely words to live by, but in a society that currently thrives on retribution, itâ€™s extremely difficult to toe the line of justice when injustice, vengeance, and distrust are barreling in from all sides.There are so many lessons in this book, and even though they're ensconced in a place of hatred, prejudice, and heinous acts, readers will understand the authors' messages and leave the text understanding what's at stake when wrong prevails over right and injustice threatens to supersede justice.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25AQRUPZRXK3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0181BILKK#wasThisHelpful","R25AQRUPZRXK3T","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Once again, Emma Hart meticulously weaves a story that is suspenseful, sassy, and sexy. Hart provides readers with another layer of complex private eye, Noelle Bond, and once again illustrates why Noelleâ€™s the independent, foul mouthed woman Drake and readers canâ€™t get enough of even if she spikes all of our blood pressures with her balls to the wall antics.I love the way Noelleâ€™s mind works, and even if, at times, it seems like she is easily distracted, when her A game is needed, she brings it and proves why sheâ€™s always a step or two ahead of the police. Noel has the uncanny ability to see beyond the facts and reasonable doubt in order to find the truth, and regardless of the threat, Noelle works to solve every case by any means necessary as long as she has her cupcakes, her gun, and her heels.Now, if only Noelle would give up some of her control and allow Drake to protect her and show her what it means for someone to have her back because his Fred Flintstone demeanor needs just as much dominance, and Noelleâ€™s crazy and risky maneuvers as well as her need to argue about EVERYTHING both infuriates and turns Drake on, which means the outcome might be a huge fight and the silent treatment or a round of down and dirty sex.While Noelle and Drakeâ€™s bond grows, thereâ€™s a killer on the loose, and, once again, Noelleâ€™s called in to assist with the case, â€œborrowingâ€ information, following leads, and tracking down suspects. Itâ€™s what she does best, but itâ€™s also what causes â€œDroelleâ€ to become a bit unhinged, squaring off against one anotherâ€™s stubbornness and single minded mentality.But thatâ€™s what makes the Holly Wood Files series so good because not only does it have great main and supporting characters, but the story line definitely keeps readersâ€™ interest as the detectives and private eyes work to stop a killer and with the humor and steam incorporated into the plot, thereâ€™s never a dull moment with Noelle Bond and her family and friends.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BRB708V8YACJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TNHLPI#wasThisHelpful","R3BRB708V8YACJ","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I love most about Tillie Coleâ€™s storytelling, especially in her Scarred Souls series, is that she allows her readers to see and feel EVERYTHING that her characters endure. She forces us into the darkness, fighting alongside her heroes and struggling for just one moment of lightnessâ€¦for a way to be more than what they were made intoâ€¦more than a numberâ€¦more than beast. And, as her characters are brought to the depths of hell, readers keep their eyes and minds open because we need to understand their suffering; we need to be able to visualize the mistreatment, the torture, the pain; we need to realize that Raze and 221 were turned into killing machines. They were no longer boys and then men, they were slaves and dogs sent to reign down death on those their master or owner commanded. That was their existence for as long as they can remember because their memories were taken away with their freedom and they were meant to live and die in squalor, having no idea what waited for them in the light.As Raze became Luka, 221 becomes Zaal, but a part of them both will always be a killerâ€¦a man who thirsts for revengeâ€¦whose rage overwhelms himâ€¦who must sort through the confusion to find the truth.Reap is a story of redemption; itâ€™s a story that illustrates the true meaning of soulful love and how that kind of connection soothes the fire insideâ€¦heals irreparable wounds. Itâ€™s 221â€™s journey to the light and how his freedom leads him to a woman who is supposed to be forbidden but all he sees her as is his.Talia Tolstaia is a Mafia princess regardless of how much she wished she wasnâ€™t. Sheâ€™s always struggled to find her place in that world, simply enduring her fatherâ€™s dictates and finding her own ways around them. But when Zaal enters her life, she finally feels whole because that primitive man becomes everything to her in such a short amount of time, and itâ€™s her love, her strength, and her commitment to him that allows Zaal to become more than a programmed killerâ€¦more than a fierce monster. Talia allows him to become free in every sense of the word.But Reap is not only 221â€™s story; itâ€™s Lukaâ€™s as well because he is not whole even with everything that heâ€™s done and received since he escaped. No one becomes fully healed in such a short amount of time when they endured years of brutality and darkness. It still lives and festers in Raze, threatening to destroy all of his progression because no matter how much he tries to remove that part of himself, the part of a killer, he canâ€™t do it. So Reap is also Lukaâ€™s struggle to find a balance in his life as the Russian Mafia prince but also as a man who needs to release the rage inside him for the sake of himself and those he loves.Tillie Cole delivers a well-crafted and complex story line each time she releases a book; from her first text to her newest one, I am in awe of the power she holds over me every time I enter one of her worlds, and I canâ€™t wait to see what she has in store for her readers next.A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.5 Poison Apples (The Fairest of All Book Reviews)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDYFL6TRDDU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZON5LN4#wasThisHelpful","RPDYFL6TRDDU5","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deanna MaddenJess ReillyPsychopathCybersex QueenKillerEvilInsaneBrokenQuiltyThis is the sum of all of Deanna Maddenâ€™s parts, and if you dare to look inside her mind and attempt to understand her fragmented psyche, youâ€™ll be left with a menagerie of conclusions that donâ€™t realistically define all that Deanna was, is, and might become due to her past, her own mind, and her afflictions.I know every time I enter a A. R. Torre novel, Iâ€™m going to be thrust into a world that is manipulatively twisted and deliciously dark. Much of what readers see throughout the story is merely a facadeâ€¦a small part of a much bigger puzzle and the jagged and disjointed pieces must be whittled down and understood at their core in order to solve the riddle that Torre lays out for her readers.Deanna Madden is one of the most complex heroines Iâ€™ve ever read, and itâ€™s due to how Torre constructs each part of Madden. Torre is meticulous in allowing readers inside Deannaâ€™s tormented mind; I suspect itâ€™s a bit like being in purgatory because Deannaâ€™s stuck between the good that Jeremy brings into her life as well as her drive to be  normal and free and her thirst for blood, death, and destruction. As soon as she makes gains in her lifeâ€¦in her controlâ€¦in her resolve to toe the line, she finds herself regressing and yearning for a release that only she can find with her hands around someoneâ€™s neck or one of her knives slicing through tissue.Torre marvelously depicts how conflicted Deanna is and the steps sheâ€™s willing to take to ensure that Jeremy gets everything out of life, even if it means playing a part that has become such a part of her that she canâ€™t tell the difference between whatâ€™s real and whatâ€™s pretend. Readers will also witness Deanna divulge some truths that will send them spiraling and will only add to her complexity.Deanna Madden is a walking contradiction, and If You Dare only solidifies that idea.  She can be described as unfeeling just as much as overwhelmed with emotion. Sheâ€™s evil but has times of goodness. Her madness can undo her as much as her clarity can ground her.I guess thatâ€™s why she has two namesâ€¦two realitiesâ€¦two existences. And, itâ€™s exactly what makes this series every bit as erotic and psychotic as itâ€™s described.A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6XRTADZALTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WF8IJTE#wasThisHelpful","RD6XRTADZALTR","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œYour life is on the track it is meant to be on. This is not a contest or a race. Donâ€™t compare yourself to others, only to the person you were yesterday.â€Thereâ€™s such wisdom in this statement, and itâ€™s bound to make sense, logically, but most people whose pasts have left them broken and hopeless canâ€™t understand why their â€˜trackâ€™ is such a struggleâ€¦why they canâ€™t lead a life without abuseâ€¦without feeling forgotten or cast aside. And, itâ€™s incredibly difficult not to loathe who and what theyâ€™ve become because the self-hatred is consuming and belittling.Lachlan McGregor can be described in numerous waysâ€¦Rugby player. Philanthropist. Lone Solider. Survivor. But at his core, he still feels like the lost and broken boy who was forced to find his own wayâ€¦forced to endure a life where no one truly saw the pain beneath the surfaceâ€¦where no one tried to see him for who he really isâ€¦A Beautifully Broken Scottish Beast.Kayla Moore is a complex person who doesnâ€™t truly belong to anyone, not even her friends because Stephanie and Nicola are now part of a couple and sheâ€™s merely the tag along, which leaves her feeling much of the time like the odd man out. Sure, sheâ€™s free with her mouth and her body, but sheâ€™s so much more than her man-eater persona, which is clearly illustrated through Kaylaâ€™s internal musings and her delicate â€˜black heart.â€™ Thereâ€™s a depth to Kaylaâ€™s personality that she doesnâ€™t allow anyone to see because she doesnâ€™t want to appear vulnerable or lacking.Although Kayla is not close to being as broken or as lonely as Lachlan is, thereâ€™s a connection between them that stems from more than just attraction, and thatâ€™s why they gravitate towards each other and soon find themselves giving into their desires for one another. But thereâ€™s a mountain of obstacles to overcome, both personally and as a couple, which, at times, seem insurmountable, and other times, seem to only make them stronger.The Play is an extremely emotional read about two people who are searching for their track and wind up on one together, struggling to put themselves back togetherâ€¦to figure out their passion, and to not allow the past to dominant the present and destroy the future.Lachlan and Kaylaâ€™s journey is a tumultuous mix of pain, frustration, agony, desire, and love. Karina Halle gives readers two characters who tightly hold on to hope, but, at times, itâ€™s a tenuous grip because thereâ€™s so much darkness to contend with and Lachlan has seen and done too much to not feel like itâ€™s pulling him under. But heâ€™s a fighter and Kayla has proven her scrappiness with her words and actions, so if there are two people who can make it work despite Lachlanâ€™s past, his addictions, and his insecurities as well as Kaylaâ€™s fears and struggles, itâ€™s those two, and even if the track theyâ€™re on together seems disjointed and rough, thereâ€™s more than enough love between them to give them what they need as long as theyâ€™re together.I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m saying this but Lachlan McGregor just might be my favorite dirty talking Scottish alpha male because thereâ€™s something so powerful about a man who has the heart and fight of a lion and a passion for helping the cast aside and forgotten because he understands their demons and wants to give them a small sense of hope/peace.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MQS83PA258FA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OQN4AC#wasThisHelpful","R3MQS83PA258FA","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coup de Grace is an interesting name for Michaelâ€™s story, and the fact that it is the last book in Lani Lynn Valeâ€™s Code 11-KPD Swat series seems fitting for the title as well as the man because as coup de grace implies, a finishing blow is madeâ€¦a decisive event occurs that settles conflict, alleviating the intensity of a situation.Michael is definitely a conflicted man; his nickname is â€˜Saintâ€™ because he comes to the aid of those in need, protecting children at all costs, but he refuses to have children of his own because he fears passing down his bad genetics to them; he doesnâ€™t want to ruin anyoneâ€™s life as he feels his life has been due to his bi polar disorder and depression.But what Michael doesnâ€™t seeâ€¦what he canâ€™t even begin to grasp, because heâ€™s too messed up with what heâ€™s suffered through himself, is that he has the biggest heart and a massive amount of strength and determination to succeed at anything he puts his mind toâ€¦as evident by his skill set as a cop and the fact that he could have been an excellent doctor.Nikki sees everything good in Michael, but he hurt her deeply with his mixed up declarations, and the simple fact that he could walk away from her without looking back. But now heâ€™s looking to make amends and the love that Nikki feels for Michael never faded away, so she just needs to figure out if sheâ€™s willing to risk her heart again and with Michaelâ€™s current actions, Nikkiâ€™s ready to ride the ups and downs with him as long as heâ€™s willing to give her what she wants and needs.Michael and Nikkiâ€™s story, like all of the previous couplesâ€™ stories, has a great mix of steam, suspense, and drama. Nothingâ€™s over the top or unrealistic and Lani Lynn Vale does a great job of discussing mental illness, illustrating its difficulties without diminishing its effects on everyone involved.Iâ€™m sad to see my Swat alpha malesâ€™ stories end, but I know theyâ€™ll stop by for a visit or two in Valeâ€™s new series, but she finds a way to cross over story lines and give her readers a glimpse into whatâ€™s happened to their favorite leading men and ladies.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q8MPUWATMSXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013H3U2ZO#wasThisHelpful","R3Q8MPUWATMSXE","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Feelinâ€™ reckless?If it means having a shot at Cam Strickland or Gannon Burgess, Iâ€™d definitely take the risk, but too bad for me that they only wanted one another, and despite some big obstacles â€“ the fact that they are direct opposites and have some pretty heavy baggage from each of their pasts â€“ theyâ€™re both willing to gamble on each other in order to find someone to be devoted to instead of just their jobs.An adrenalin junkie and a brainiac â€“ Cam and Gannon couldnâ€™t be more different, but in a way, thatâ€™s what makes them work because theyâ€™re able to even each other out. Neither has had an actual relationship because theyâ€™ve been too busy with work and life, but regardless of that fact, the attraction they feel for one another is something to build on and by going slow and getting to know one another, Cam and Gannon are working towards something that will last as long as Cam can deal with his fears and Gannon can deal with not being in control of Camâ€™s feelings and actions.I absolutely love Nicole Edwardsâ€™ writing, especially when she puts readers into the heads of two alpha males who want to strip each other naked and show one another how strongly they feel. The steamy scenes between Cam and Gannon illustrate the connection they share and the risks theyâ€™re willing to take to be all in for each other. Their relationship is definitely not easy, and there are times when I wondered if they were too different and had too much individually to contend with, but through all the ups and downs, the one thing that was made crystal clear is that both Cam and Gannon are worth it, and they deserve to find that one person they canâ€™t be without and itâ€™s clear that itâ€™s to each other that they belong.The collection of characters that readers will meet in Reckless are all significant people in the lives of the main characters and the camaraderie and love felt amongst them definitely adds to the overall feel of the text.

"Iâ€™ve been waiting for another charismatic, sexy, and full of himself hero from Nelle Lâ€™Amour ever since her That Man series finished and Mr. Blake Burns found his girl, and Lâ€™Amour definitely worked her character development magic with her newest cocky alpha male, Brandon Taylor. Like Blake, Brandon has a way with the ladies and oozes sex and douchiness at the same time. Heâ€™s in the entertainment industry just like Burns, although Brandonâ€™s in front of the screen not behind it. But the one astonishing similarity, which makes me a little ill just to think about it is that they both have one woman in common - a certain conniving self absorbed witch who is definitely up to no good again in Unforgettable.Nelle Lâ€™Amour definitely knows how to get inside a male characterâ€™s head and tell it like it is, but this time around, Lâ€™Amour has the challenging task of crafting Brandonâ€™s words and actions to represent who he was before the accident and who heâ€™s becoming after it. But hereâ€™s the thing, everything readers have heard about Brandon has painted quite the douchey description, which makes it difficult to understand exactly what Zoey Hart, Brandonâ€™s assistant, sees in the guy, especially when his choice of a girlfriend/fiancee is a money hungry skank who is definitely using Brandon for his bank account and celebrity status.Iâ€™m not quite sure what to think about Brandon or Zoey at this point because itâ€™s hard for me to witness Brandon continue to give into Katâ€™s outrageous wedding demands and bitchy comments while Zoey stands there and puts up with both of their mistreatment of her.Itâ€™s easy to see the chemistry between Brandon and Zoey from the first time they are reintroduced to each other, and if Iâ€™m not reading too much into the clues that Nelle Lâ€™Amour seems to be giving when it comes to crossing the lines between reality and fiction, things are about to get more complicated than they already are with a man who canâ€™t remember his last ten years and a woman whoâ€™s pined away for her boss since she started working for him but believes sheâ€™s completely invisible to him or anyone else unless sheâ€™s Katrinaâ€™s punching bag.Both Brandonâ€™s agent and fiancee seem to be playing their own games on Brandon, but until all the puzzle pieces fall into place and Brandonâ€™s memory comes back, readers and Zoey are left wondering whatâ€™s next.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LVJ0520IW2SN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017E1XMPM#wasThisHelpful","R2LVJ0520IW2SN","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ethan Dexter - an NFL center who â€œanticipates, adapts, and protectsâ€ his quarterbackâ€¦his friendsâ€¦his girl - if he can find the right one and let himself take instead of overthinking every move he makes.Ethan is quiet, and he keeps to himself. No one sees him fully unless he wants them to and the only person heâ€™s ever willingly allowed fully in is the one person who could send his calm, cool, and collective self spiraling out of control - Fiona Mackenzie.But regardless of how different Ethan and Fiona may be and despite the distance that stands in their way from truly making a relationship work, what they give to one another during the times they are together is definitely worth fighting for and finding a way to build on their attraction because feelings like the ones they have for one another deserve a chance to grow.Throughout the course of the story, Ethan helps Fiona find her joy and stop running, and every step of the way, he proves he's the best thing that has ever happened to Fiona. Regardless of how inexperienced Dex may be, with everything that he gives to Fi, there's no doubt that he is the man to tame Fiona and make her feel alive, and sheâ€™s the woman to breakthrough Ethanâ€™s rational mind and release the beast within in every delicious way possible.Dex is definitely in the running for my top favorite book boyfriend of 2015!He is the complete package...he's a gentleman...he's an alpha. He's a giver and a pleaser. He is AMAZING!I wasnâ€™t sure if I was going to like the Fiona/Dex connection, but surprisingly, as Fi fights for what she wants and stops running long enough to see whatâ€™s standing right in front of her, she grows on me and has me supporting her decisions, cheering for her to get her man once and for all despite how exposed she may be by being Ethanâ€™s girl.Kristen Callihanâ€™s Game On series is one of my favorite sports romance collections out there because her heroes may be flawed, but they are willing to change for the right girl, and her heroines are not docile women - they refuse to be pushed around and arenâ€™t afraid to take control.  The story lines are also realistic in what the characters must deal with due to the football god status of the heroes and the back stories Callihan provides for her characters bring a sense of understanding to their current actions and it makes it so much easier to stay strong for the couple as they work through the chaos because thereâ€™s no doubt they want and deserve to be together.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4GXS544A6E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TW5PV6#wasThisHelpful","R3R4GXS544A6E8","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll never be ready to say goodbye to my favorite alpha Aussie Cowboys and their kickass women, but if it's time to move on then I'm glad Kasey Millstead gives readers final look into their lives, their love, and the friendships that have lasted decades.Eden and Jackson will always be my favorite couple because they're the ones who started the series and brought readers into this tight knit community, but the rest of the twosomes added their own brand of steam, romance and drama, which kept us coming back each time, learning more about each couple and what they were willing to endure in order to be together.What I love most about Cowboy Endings is that readers get to see each of their favorite couples over a decade later and immerse themselves in the reality of life with growing older, having kids who are teenagers or older, and going through situations that all couples may go through at some stage in their relationship.Each novella is perfectly imperfect which speaks to the realities of life and the possibilities, both good and bad, of spending a lifetime together.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCQC8TPXGJK5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HAO2MA#wasThisHelpful","RCQC8TPXGJK5E","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any book that discusses Dawsonâ€™s Creek, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, mullets, and a forever kind of love is absolutely a book I want to read, and this is exactly the kind of story that Tessa Teevan gives readers in Fusion.We live. We laugh. We love.Three of the most simplest sentences out there but also three of the most consuming and complicated ideas that even with a lifetime to experience them, no one will truly understand how meaningful they are unless they give themselves fully over to someone they canâ€™t live withoutâ€¦to someone who was there since they were kids.Sierra and Jeremyâ€™s story began when they were eight years old and didnâ€™t really know what friendship or love even meant, but regardless of that fact, what they found in each other all those years ago was a forever kind of friendship and love that may have taken them awhile to figure out, but once they recognized what they could mean to each other and the life they could make together that was all it took to alter their lives in the most blissful and worthwhile ways.Where you go, I go.No truer words were said by Sierra and Jeremy to each other on multiple occasions than these ones. It represents what they are to one another down to the core and what theyâ€™re willing to do to ensure their connection remains despite the distance or hurdles they might experience.What I loved most about Fusion was how easy it was to see from the very beginning of the story that Sierra and Jeremy were meant to be together and how easy their relationship progressed once it started. Donâ€™t get me wrongâ€¦they faced obstacles and darkness, but it was never anything that would tear them apart because they were part of each otherâ€™s soul and that never changed despite a few times when they lost their way.The reality of Sierra and Jeremyâ€™s relationship in the book was a testament to the kind of people they are and how much better they were when they were side by side, taking on every aspect of life, and Tessa Teevan does a fantastic job of illustrating the ease and depth of their connection even when they were blind to how they truly felt about each other.In Fusion, readers are granted an insiderâ€™s look into Sierra and Jeremyâ€™s twenty year friendship and a bond that every couple hopes for but very few hold on to, which only makes other couples wish to emulate what they have even more.A lifetime of memories with times of pain and heartbreak as well as extreme joy resonate off the pages of Sierra and Jeremyâ€™s story, and I loved being a part of every moment, both good and bad, because each one is real and honest and pure and they are a testament to a life and a love worth EVERYTHING.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U733CET2S3WJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017AK0UKM#wasThisHelpful","R1U733CET2S3WJ","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thereâ€™s only one Buck Butterson, and Helena Hunting illustrates that thatâ€™s not necessarily a bad thing because heâ€™s definitely a handful, but what I also love about Pucked Up is that because itâ€™s told through Buckâ€™s perspective, readers are able to see the man who hides behind his manwhore statusâ€¦a guy who takes a vested interest in helping those in need and doesnâ€™t look for anything in return.Both Sunny and Buck are unique individuals who are a bit awkward and unpredictable, but thatâ€™s what makes them work. It was always going to take a special woman to tame the yetiâ€¦to see beyond his past anticsâ€¦to understand that even though a picture speaks a thousand words, sometimes, theyâ€™re the wrong ones.It was interesting to see how distorted situations can become when theyâ€™re taken out of context and the fact that people are judged relentlessly based on their past actions is definitely an idea that is strewn throughout the course of the text, and although Buck didnâ€™t make the best/right choices throughout his career and with the puck bunnies, he canâ€™t redeem himself when every time he goes somewhere, it gets out of control and his past dictates the conclusions others make.Relationships are hard, especially with someone as inept as Buck is with how to make one work. But if thereâ€™s one constant feeling I had as I read his story, it was pride for Buckâ€™s relentless attempts to redeem himself and prove that heâ€™s not the manwhore that he used to be and he has more positive qualities and intelligence than anyone would ever expect.I love Helena Huntingâ€™s Pucked series and her imperfect heroes and quirky heroines. The over the top and hilarious antics make it an easy and lighthearted read that will keep a smile on readersâ€™ faces every time they think of Huntingâ€™s Pucked men and women.I hope Vanceâ€™s story is next because that playboy needs to be knocked down a peg or two, and I think I know just the woman to do it.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LGXV5HY11KAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OR83AG#wasThisHelpful","R2LGXV5HY11KAE","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Webster dictionary defines FRICTION as â€œconflict or animosity caused by a clash of wills, temperaments, or opinions,â€ and that explanation aptly describes the type of love/hate relationship that the main characters in Sawyer Bennettâ€™s newest release, Leary Michaels and Reeve Holloway, find themselves in, in both the bedroom and the court room. Their clients are on opposite ends of the spectrum, which means one is fighting for voiceless and the other is leading the charge for those who refuse to pay for their misdeeds simply because they have the clout to do so.But how can a relationship exist between two people who are sworn enemies in the courtroom without the personal and professional lines crossing? And, what happens when one is willing to risk everything, sacrificing her ethics in the process, and the other simply does what heâ€™s told never anticipating the consequences to irrevocably alter his life?Thereâ€™s no easy verdict when it comes to finding a balance between the head and the heart, especially when Leary clearly has a vested interest in the court case they are opposing council for, and as much as Leary and Reeve want to believe that it wonâ€™t change the dynamics of their personal relationship, an emotional case based on societal perceptions and coerced information can easily sway the strongest of bonds.Discord. Strife. Conflict. These words epitomize Leary and Reeveâ€™s interactions but so do Flirty. Filthy. Sensual. And, it seems as if the dichotomy of their feelings for each other is exactly what solidifies the passion and intrigue that exists between them.Friction is another fantastic read from Sawyer Bennett. Bennett writes each scene that deals with the law meticulously so that readers can truly visual the events/conversations/courtroom antics that occur throughout the text. Itâ€™s as if we are one of the spectators in the room watching the case play out in real time and feeling the electricity that exists between Leary and Reeve.Itâ€™s a great story that clearly shows that thereâ€™s more to the truth than simple black and white answers, and thatâ€™s the idea that leads Leary to fight for the right outcome of her case and her relationship with Reeve.On to the next case!A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MSBNMBPU1X3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XCAOXI0#wasThisHelpful","R1MSBNMBPU1X3L","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happens when a feisty princess marries the naughty king?A whole lot of sexual tension, blurred lines, and one hell of a complication to a situation that has already spiraled out of control.Add in a meddling best friend and a controlling board who has a clear path for King and his company, and readers have the makings of a highly charged and a bit volatile showdown between two people who are sworn enemies but canâ€™t keep their hands off of each other.Feisty Princess picks up right where Naughty King left off, and the fallout from Alexander and Margoâ€™s drunken night has significant repercussions for both of them in terms of their plans to undermine each other and get what they want, and when other people get involved and threaten to expose the façade of their relationship, the princess and the king need to decide whatâ€™s real and whatâ€™s fiction and what theyâ€™re willing to do to be the winner in the end.Feisty Princess is a great follow-up to book 1 and it sets the stage for whatâ€™s to come in Dirty Royals. Alexander and Margo are beginning to mean more to each other than they should, which doesnâ€™t bode too well for their individual agendas, so Iâ€™m eager to see how Valentine ends their story, especially with how book 2 ended.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSYEBRNGABDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016L18ID2#wasThisHelpful","RSYEBRNGABDF","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"â€œThe good of the many takes priority over the good one.â€This is the code Hancock lives by; a belief system that has no room for feelings or emotionsâ€¦no place for mercy or conscience. Itâ€™s a way of life that makes Hancock a heartless jerk, manipulating and sacrificing people and not worrying about who gets hurt in the process as long as justice is brought and the majority is saved.But Honor Cambridge, a woman who has more courage and resourcefulness than many men, complicates Hancockâ€™s fight to rid the world of dangerous criminals because as much as he tries to remain void of any feelings when it comes to Honor, she slowly seeps into his pores and threatens to unravel not only his mission but his whole way of life.Iâ€™ve read many of Maya Banksâ€™ stories, but this is my first one in her KGI series. Thankfully, though, I didnâ€™t feel lost in the dangerous and undercover world Banks created because she lays out the plot line at the beginning and provides enough of Hancockâ€™s back story to allow me to understand what he believes in and why he does what he does for a living. Iâ€™ll admitâ€¦Honor and Hancock's story started out a bit slow for me, but once the hunt begins, the pace of the story shifts, and readers begin to understand the mission that Hancock and his team are on and just how much Honor alters every aspect of it.Maya Banks does a fantastic job of illustrating the emotional and physical torment that Honor goes through at the hands of a man she thinks is helping her and those men who wish her bodily harm. As Honor slinks further into herself and the darkness thatâ€™s consuming her with every lieâ€¦every volatile act threatens to immerse her fully, I couldnâ€™t stop crying. It was almost as if I could feel Honorâ€™s devastation and the numbing consequences of those acts against her by the men who want her dead and the man who seems conflicted at what he exactly wants from her. I couldnâ€™t read fast enough during this part of the story because I needed Hancock to redeem himself, and I needed Honor to be okayâ€¦to do more than survive, but I didnâ€™t truly see any way for that to happen with everything that went down with Hancock as well as Bristow and Maksimov.A sacrificial lamb or a redeeming angelâ€¦a cold blooded mercenary or a man with a conscience.  Throughout most of the story, I couldnâ€™t quite decide what Hancock would decide to do with Honor, especially when time after time, Honor proves that sheâ€™s so much more than a pawn in a deadly game. But like the title implies, thereâ€™s going to be a hell of a lot of darkness and evil before redemption can find its way out into the light.A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3L4SA2Y5CEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQSF6CE#wasThisHelpful","RJ3L4SA2Y5CEP","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone has heard of the saying â€œactions speak louder than words,â€ and while thatâ€™s definitely true in most cases, sometimes, words mean EVERYTHING, and when theyâ€™re not said, the devastation is deep and pronounced, so much so that there might not be a way to come back from whatâ€™s remained unsaid.Tobias Jackson loves words - thatâ€™s why heâ€™s an English major, but when it comes to being able to say how he feels and lay everything on the line, he falters for a number of reasons, but the biggest one is that he refuses to get close enough for anyone to hurt himâ€¦anyone to walk away from him like his mother did and like his father does on a regular basis because he refuses to talk to his son or even get to know him.Levi Baxter has always been the guy of Tobyâ€™s dreamsâ€¦the one who stars in his late night wet dreams. But that Levi was always way better than the real Levi - the one who treated his brother and Toby like crap and always thought he was better than them. But time away from the small town of Coburn has changed both Toby and Levi, creating a sizzling connection between them and leading them down a path where they have to hide their attraction from those closest to them as well as deny their true feelings for one another because itâ€™s too scary a situationâ€¦too much changeâ€¦too much of a chance of getting hurt.A Hundred Thousand Words was my first read from Nyrae Dawn, and what I loved about it is that even though it's in the New Adult genre, there's a uniqueness to the storyline that makes the text more meaningful. Toby and Levi both have issues to work through and find solace in one another, and even though their problems don't go away, and they probably should have faced them awhile ago, they lend an ear to each other and teach each other what it means to care for someone else and willingly risk everything that scares them.â€œFor someone who loves words so much, you suck at using them when it really matters.â€And Levi matters, so Toby better find the words - no matter how many it takes - or else heâ€™s going to be exactly like his father - a man of few wordsâ€¦few emotionsâ€¦few close relationships.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U0CQ6PBVUHL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0169DQ7CG#wasThisHelpful","R1U0CQ6PBVUHL5","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FineThe Webster dictionary defines it as â€œgood, acceptable, or satisfactory,â€ but based on its societal use, we learn to see fine as anything but â€“ more so said as a way to avoid getting into anything too personal, but clearly indicating that life is not good at the moment and the person who said it doesnâ€™t want to go any further than that even though itâ€™s clear that things are not well.For Levee Williams and Sam Rivers, those feelings of being fine lead them both to a cross roads in their life, unsure of how to rebuild, refocus, and reenergize when all they feel like doing is succumbing to the pain, the pressure, and the sadness by falling into the darkness.GreatFrom an onlookerâ€™s perspective, Levee and Samâ€™s lives are wonderful. Sheâ€™s a pop princess with droves of fans and more money than she can spend, and he does something he loves by repurposing furniture and selling it at a high price. But beyond the faÃ§adeâ€¦beyond the smoke and mirrors, are two people who are consumed with sadness and depressionâ€¦two people who donâ€™t know where to turn in order to feel something besides pain because thatâ€™s whatâ€™s wrapped around them, refusing to let go and taking them further down in the process.Can Levee and Sam be each otherâ€™s great? Or are they destined to keep plummeting, free falling without any chance of survival?How does one Fall Up? Well, if everyone had a Sam Rivers in their lives, they would easily understand how itâ€™s done and why Levee never questioned giving in and climbing up. But the way itâ€™s described is not easy, which is clearly illustrated through Leveeâ€™s internal conflict and quick reactions as well as her struggle to admit that she needs help.Aly Martinez does a fantastic job of putting readers inside both Levee and Samâ€™s heads and forcing us to feel every single emotion and hear every single dark thought. Martinez gives us the insight into Leveeâ€™s mind that no one else can see because if they did, they would have stepped in long ago because she is anything but fine, and the only way that Sam can recognize Leveeâ€™s pain is because he feels the same way albeit due to different circumstances, but itâ€™s still something that defines him as much as it defines her, and Samâ€™s recognition and caretaking attributes are the only things that can catch Levee, but she has to be willing to walk back down with Sam, which is a decision that Levee wonâ€™t be able to make until sheâ€™s ready to admit whatâ€™s going on and deal with it head on, and thatâ€™s the journey that Aly Martinez takes readers on, and itâ€™s a ride weâ€™ll never forget.I absolutely loved the message of The Fall Up! Everyone who reads it will definitely feel a connection to what Sam and Levee go through, even if only in small ways. Aly Martinez is such an extremely talented writer because her words mean more than she probably even realizes, which is why she's one of my favorites!Canâ€™t wait to see what Aly gives readers nextâ€¦maybe a book for Henry???4.5 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGXGM0N3NVMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0176JLJDE#wasThisHelpful","R3FGXGM0N3NVMP","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In baseball, triple plays are a rarity; it takes extreme precision and teamwork in order to execute a play with multiple players involved. But itâ€™s also more than thatâ€¦everything has to be moving in tandem because one slip up can destroy a carefully constructed unit.Iâ€™m not usual one to discuss life using a baseball analogy but it only seems fitting for Drewâ€™s story because itâ€™s titled Triple Play and that is exactly how many people are involved; although, itâ€™s not on the baseball fieldâ€¦In reading the previous two books, I had a good amount of background knowledge on Eric and Drew, but Bryce was still an unknown character. But from the start of the text, I knew, in a way, that Bryce was going to be the one that solidified everything between the three of them because he had the emotional strength to do so. He took charge and pushed when he needed to in order to make both Eric and Drew see that societyâ€™s view on things didnâ€™t matter because what they felt for each other and what they gave to each other worked for them in a way that made sense and felt right so to hell with anyone who disagreed or looked down on them for their choices.But having three people exist in one relationship can get messy and stressful; there are a lot of different emotions to take into account and handle with care, and for an author to explore three varying perspectives, it's sometimes difficult to present a full insider's view of the main characters' thoughts and feelings when there are three people involved and equal exploration needs to be provided in order to truly see how their polyamorous relationship works. At times, I found it difficult to truly understand how Drew, Bryce, and Eric made everything work despite their dominating personalities and tense reactions to situations because I didn't feel privy to all three perspectives at the various intense moments. I wanted to experience more of the development of their feelings and truly witness how it went from just fooling around and having fun to deep rooted feelings between all three, and while at times, I did feel like I got a pretty good look at some aspects of their commitment to each other, there were other times that I wished for more.That being said, I truly enjoyed Drew, Bryce, and Eric's story because of the lessons taught through Drew's ordeal as well as Bryce's commitment to help LGBT teens who have nowhere to turn or live. It filled me with a sense of pride to see three strong gay men work to help those who needed their support and do more than throw money at the issues. The latter part of the book truly illustrated how the three men had grown and transformed through one anotherâ€™s guidance, pushing, and commitment, which is all anyone wants to experience in a relationship.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.3.5/4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37P0JS1FH909Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015K0BQP2#wasThisHelpful","R37P0JS1FH909Z","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The British are coming! The British are coming! And, boy are readers ready for them, especially when they come in the form of two deliciously, irresistible twin hotties, Declan and Dax Blay. Declan is a swoon worthy hero who has so much heart and fight in him that there isnâ€™t any obstacle he canâ€™t overcome, which is good because heâ€™s going to need that determination or no quit attitude to claim his Unicorn girl regardless of how much she tries to push him away.I read a lot of college romances, so when I find one that becomes so much more than the qualities of its genre, I revel in its story line and complex characters, which is exactly what I did with Dirty English.Iâ€™m a high school English teacher, so I know all about Jane Austenâ€™s Pride and Prejudice and Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, and I love to see classics modernized in a way that allows current society a small glimpse into Austenâ€™s world and the passion and drama that she put her characters through in order for them to learn and grow. Ilsa Madden-Mills gives her readers a much more contemporary Elizabeth Bennett and a more manly Mr. Darcy in Declan Blay, but at the heart of Elizabeth and Declanâ€™s story is the realization of what kindred souls can give to one another and how faith and self-worth can be restored by opening oneâ€™s heart and taking a chance despite the potential heart break. Elizabeth and Declanâ€™s love story may be more angst riddled and more dramatic, but it still holds true to the ideas and values that Austen wanted her audience to realize â€“ hope, second chances, and a way to set oneâ€™s heart free.Elizabeth Bennett is a heroine that readers canâ€™t help but love because her fortitude is inspiring. No one should have to endure the events that Elizabeth has, but even though the darkness threatened to consume and break her, she continued to fight, and she made herself rise above the pain and heartache despite wanting to give up on multiple occasions. Elizabeth wasnâ€™t entirely healed; in fact, she worked hard to close herself off to almost everyone in order to avoid any further devastation, but Declan gave her no other option but to allow him into her life and eventually into her heart and heal her through his compassion and strength.Declan Blay is a scarred hero as well; he might not be fighting the kind of demons that Elizabeth is, but heâ€™s still been put through the wringer in a way that has made him overly cautious of women and his faith in them has been all but destroyed. But thereâ€™s something about Elizabeth Bennett that draws Declan in from the start and even though he fights with himself over pursuing her, claiming sheâ€™s not the one for him, he canâ€™t deny he wants her in every way possible and heâ€™ll do what it takes to restore them both.Mr. Darcy has nothing on Declan Blay; in fact, with his tattoos and fighting skills, Declan easily surpasses Mr. Darcy and epitomizes every imaginable connotative meaning of Dirty English!Boy do I love Ilsa Madden-Mills â€“ her writing, her characters, her sexy scenes, her angst filled torment â€“ EVERYTHING about her stories works for me in lasting ways, and I canâ€™t wait to see what sheâ€™ll have for readers in Daxâ€™s story!A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33PHJGJJL7G9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016HBRORW#wasThisHelpful","R33PHJGJJL7G9E","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of Nikolai and Maya's book holds multiple meanings for both of them, and it also represents what could become of them if Nik doesn't figure out a way to protect Maya from her monstrous father and his end game if Maya's memories resurface.Readers first met Nikolai in Elude, and we could tell from his first appearance that he was harboring a multitude of secrets and walking a fine line between what he's supposed to do and what he wants to do. This idea is expounded on in Rip and the many layers of Nik's personality are peeled away little by little with his interaction with Maya and his realization about what it will take to free himself and Maya from her father.Nik may be a master manipulator and pride himself on his control and ability to keep people at a distance, but Maya's a game changer for his purpose, his familyâ€™s legacy, and his identity; in fact, their first encounter when she was 16 solidified what she would come to mean to him, and there was really nothing he could do to prevent her from either destroying or redeeming him.Mayaâ€™s in a precarious situation not of her own doing, and so as her conflicted feelings for Nikoali lead to rash actions and unlocked memories, sheâ€™s even more confused about Nikâ€™s position with her father and if heâ€™s truly a monster who means her harm or the only person who can save her from the danger thatâ€™s coming at her from multiple sides.Like all of Rachel Van Dykenâ€™s mafia books, Nikoali and Mayaâ€™s story is consumed with mysteries and unanswered questions, and they are slowly revealed and answered throughout the course of the text, keeping readers caught up in the manipulation, seduction, and destruction that threatens everything thatâ€™s building between Nik and Maya and everything Nikâ€™s been working to tirelessly to protect.I absolutely loved RIP; Van Dyken continues to dazzle me with her dark, dangerous, and deadly Mafia men â€“ guys who will do anything to protect those they love and those who have their backs. The Russian/Italian connection in the book although tenuous leads me to believe that that alliance will come into play some time in the future in the Eagle Elite series, and I canâ€™t wait to see how Van Dyken incorporates it.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EY6CP1G1TRZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CU7PEA#wasThisHelpful","R1EY6CP1G1TRZT","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the connotative meanings that go along with the title of Quinn and Tazenâ€™s story, Hard to Break, because there are a multitude of positive and negative experiences that they go through both individually and as a couple that definitely demonstrate what it means to splinter, fracture, and come unhinged.Since her motherâ€™s death, Quinnâ€™s life has been like fighting an uphill battle that always sends her tumbling down, but that hasnâ€™t stopped her from trying to move forward, relying on only herself to keep a roof over her and her father and keep the shop open and out of the red. All of these are daunting tasks, but through it all, Quinn refuses to break; she refuses to quit, and one way or another, sheâ€™s going to prove that the garage is where she belongs no matter what the cocky son of b***h says!Tazen Watts - the name oozes sex and charm - too bad none of his smooth talking wins Quinn over; in fact, his demeanor and attitude grates her nerves and turns her crush on him into an all out war of barbs and antics.The volatile nature of Taz and Quinnâ€™s relationship goes from bad to worse when Taz takes the one thing Quinnâ€™s always had, threatening to unhinge her entire life and forcing her to fight dirty in order to maintain some sense of what defines her. But when everything plays out, who will break whom and what kind of fracturing will it be? The kind that draws people together or tears them even further apart?Even though Hard to Break is a slightly predictable enemies to loversâ€™ story, I still enjoyed watching Tazen and Quinn rev each other up until they both blew in a variety of ways! I love the fact that Quinn is a phenomenal mechanic and lets her work speak for itself. Sheâ€™s exactly who she portrays herself to be and to me, thatâ€™s why Taz is drawn to her even though they come from completely different worlds. Taz is also quite surprising once Quinn gets underneath his tough exterior; heâ€™s actually quite sweet and knows what Quinn needs as their relationship progresses. Thereâ€™s some angst but not an excessive amount. The primary focus is more on Quinnâ€™s refusal to stop fighting and how Tazenâ€™s realizes her unbreakable spirit is exactly why heâ€™s falling for her.A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.3.5 poison apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MVK0QHK9BQWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRFUEK2#wasThisHelpful","R2MVK0QHK9BQWA","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved the deliciously dirty talking Aidan Burke, and Jessie Law is the perfect girl for him because she refuses to allow him to control her, and she is more than happy to put Aidan in his place.Every lie begins with truth.Every legend was borne of reality.All readers have probably seen the effects of a lie and the fact that it can instantly fester and spread is not unusual, and that is exactly what happens when Aidan forces Jessie to pretend to be his girlfriend. But what happens when small glimpses of the truth sneak into the lie - can the truth ever out power the lie or is there no way to push past the deceit solidified so much so that no one will believe anything but the fabrication?The deceitfulness of lies and the mess they make is a huge topic of discussion in Dirty Lies...but another just as important issue is what crazy fans and online keyboard warriors do to the lives of the famous and those they love, and depending on how the celebrities are able to handle the chaos/gossip/altered facts determines whether or not they can be in a relationship and make it or watch it burn out due to lack of trust and understanding.I love enemies to loversâ€™ storylines, especially when thereâ€™s a rich history between the hero and heroine. This is exactly the situation that Aidan and Jessie find themselves in when he steps in to help her and ends up setting social media on fire, which in turn, brings out Jessieâ€™s witch mode, which I adore, and sends them down a rather tumultuous path of secrets, lies, and hard truths.The way Emma Hart plays out Aidan and Jessieâ€™s fake relationship is brilliant because itâ€™s completely realistic, and as the saying goes, thereâ€™s a thin line between love and hate, which definitely proves true for these two.There are multiple layers to how Aidan and Jessie feel about each other and because Hart allows both of their perspectives to be heard, readers understand Jessieâ€™s concerns, Aidanâ€™s outlook, and the reasons theyâ€™re both denying how much they actual work.Jessie Law is one of my favorite heroines because she doesnâ€™t give a ratâ€™s a** about what other people think about her and she has never been afraid to do her own thing. Sheâ€™s a passionate woman who is easily wound up by Aidan, but she also knows how to give it right back to him.Dirty Lies is a phenomenal read; itâ€™s sexy, angsty, and dirty, which is a perfect combination - one that Emma Hart continues to master!One more Burke boy to go!!A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BK0XBDC6KTIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRBQPE0#wasThisHelpful","R1BK0XBDC6KTIQ","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Iâ€™m a bit torn about Kit and Noahâ€™s story. Now that Iâ€™m privy to Noahâ€™s secrets, I completely understand the destructive steps he took to push Kit and his feelings for her away; his tortured soul and self disgust would not allow him to clearly see what Kit was offering him and because he felt like he didnâ€™t deserve her, he destroyed both of their hearts in the process. That being said, though, I had a hard time witnessing Noahâ€™s missteps, and I couldnâ€™t quite grasp why he would willfully crush Kit because I didnâ€™t know what he was hiding until close to the end of the story.I understand the reasons for Nalini Singh not wanting to expose Noahâ€™s past right away, and I also know that there are clues along the way, but without truly knowing what demons Noah was battling, I didnâ€™t feel a connection to him, which prevented me from keeping an open mind about Noahâ€™s actions and actually made me question why Kit was willingly putting herself through the pain and torture of trying to be Noahâ€™s friend again. Iâ€™m all for a tortured hero proving himself and doing what it takes to get his girl and show her that heâ€™s changed and he can be who she wants him to be, but Noahâ€™s cruelty was reprehensible and it was difficult for me to see past it.Hereâ€™s the thing, though, even though I didnâ€™t like Noah for much of the text, Singh does do a fantastic job of showing readers how conflicted both Noah and Kit are; she allows us inside their heads and we can clearly see how much Noahâ€™s betrayal tore both of them apart and destroyed a relationship that both of them felt necessary in order to make it through their crazy paparazzi filled lives.Rock Redemption has a slow building plot line. What Noah broke had to be fixed and that kind of damage canâ€™t be repaired over night. I do appreciate that Singh didnâ€™t immediately reunite Noah and Kit because thereâ€™s a lot to work through both individually and as a potential couple. But I would have liked a bit more at the end of the story, illustrating who Noah and Kit are now and how theyâ€™ve changed since everything happened and the truth of Noahâ€™s past came out.

"Tortured. Conflicted. Damaged. Broken.These are all perfect descriptors of what Harrison has become after he lost the love of his life and their unborn child at the hand of a group of bikers. Since that day, Harrison has battled his rage and vowed revenge on any biker, classifying them all as dangerous and despicable people who have no redeeming qualities.Harrison is his own worst enemy because his hardened heart keeps him from moving on and giving his heart to anyone else. The man who prides himself on control and requires full submission from his sexual partners will share his body with them, but heâ€™ll never give them any other part because besides his need for a release, he has no other feelings but pain and anger.Harrison needs someone to save him from himself and help him to move forward instead of staying in the past, but there arenâ€™t many women strong enough to endure his controlling ways nor his hot/cold demeanor, and regardless of how much Eva loves the way Harrison gets her to submit to his every sexual command, she doesnâ€™t know if Harrison can be saved, or if she even wants to take responsibility for that arduous task after dealing with her jerk of an ex and the damage he did to her.Can a person so devastatedly broken be fixed?Can a man who hasnâ€™t cared about anything in such a long time learn to care with the help of the right woman?Can a couple who has only ever given each other their bodies commit to more?These are the questions that Jani Kay answers in Tormented, and because theyâ€™re complicated issues, Kay takes her time in offering the solutions that her readers want because Harrison will have to seek his own absolution before he can fully give himself to Eva and Eva might not be able to wait as long as Harrison needs.Harrison and Evaâ€™s story is a dark and volatile journey that takes them both to hell and back in more ways than one.

"If youâ€™re the son of Cash Mayson, youâ€™ve heard the stories about your father and his brothers finding their BOOM, and whether you believe the tales or not, a part of you has to be waiting for that feelingâ€¦that moment when everything comes together and the girl youâ€™re supposed to spend forever with is put in your path. Iâ€™m sure Jax never would have thought heâ€™d come face to face with his BOOM in the situation that he does, but one thingâ€™s for sure, once he lays eyes on Ellie Anthony, he feels EVERYTHING that heâ€™s been told he would, and regardless of if she knows it or not, Ellieâ€™s his.No female can prepare for or contend with a Mayson male when he has his sights set on them and who would want to? Even though Ellie doesnâ€™t know how to deal with Jax and his persisting, claiming ways, it doesnâ€™t mean sheâ€™s adverse to them; she just doesnâ€™t know how to handle his advances because she hasnâ€™t led that kind of life. Ellieâ€™s innocent to a lot of things in life, and sheâ€™s not used to someone looking out for her and having her back. Since she was 19, sheâ€™s relied on only herself in raising her daughter and living life with very little. Aurora Rose Reynolds does a fantastic job of illustrating how overwhelmed Ellie is by Jax and his entire family. Ellieâ€™s in a complicated situation because there are things she hasnâ€™t shared with Jaxâ€¦things that could completely change his view of her, and she doesnâ€™t feel ready to expose those secrets because in her mind, Jax is still a wildcard due to his past with women.Jax is an amazing hero; the way he steps up for both Ellie and Hope is swoon worthy. Through his words and his actions, Jax proves how much he wants Ellie to be his and the steps heâ€™s willing to take to make her believe that what he feels and what they could have are real. Jax is a Mayson, so it goes without saying that heâ€™s had his share of women but just like his father and uncles, he knows when he first sets his eyes on Ellie that sheâ€™s the only one for him, and he goes about making sure everyone around them understands that as well.Until Jax is a sexy and sweet story that continues to prove why the Mayson men are the epitome of the alpha hottie. Every time Aurora Rose Reynolds introduces readers to a new one, they can rest assure that the journey to their happily ever after is going to filled with smokinâ€™ hot scenes, jealousy, and a bit of drama, which is a combination we just canâ€™t get enough of when it comes to these ultimate men.Bring on the next BOOM!A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2424TDW3BTGRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517382025#wasThisHelpful","R2424TDW3BTGRY","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chelle Bliss does a great job of giving her readers a true alpha male in looks, attitude, and perspective. In Unlawful Desire, Bliss tells Frisco Jonesâ€™ story through his own eyes, so readers get to truly understand his reluctance in getting into any kind of relationship more than a sexual one due to his past with his cheating fiancÃ©e. We also get to witness the bond that Frisco has with the other members of the ALFA Private Investigation Team and his brotherly friendships with his crew from the Neon Cowboy.Frisco Jonesâ€™ hesitancy to start anything with Georgia regardless of Sunshineâ€™s persistence and his obvious desire for Georgia makes perfect sense; heâ€™s broken from his last relationship, which is clear from his internal thoughts and outward hot/cold actions, but what I had a bit of a hard time with was the fact that Frisco worked so hard to distance himself from Georgia but then he quickly goes all in and canâ€™t get enough of her â€“ their ping pong relationship gave me whiplash at times. Donâ€™t get me wrongâ€¦I do understand Friscoâ€™s reactions and his ultimate decision to be with Georgia, but Iâ€™m not sure if I just didnâ€™t feel a solid connection between them before he was all in or the fact that it felt like Frisco was more pressured into starting it in the first place that I couldnâ€™t wrap fully wrap my head around his change of heart.As separate characters, I loved Frisco and Georgia; theyâ€™re both straight shooters who are a bit jaded from their past relationships. Regardless of their age difference and Georgiaâ€™s innocence, her sassiness and playfulness get under Friscoâ€™s skin and make him rethink numerous times in the beginning that he should just give into his desires for her. But as a couple I struggled because Frisco seemed to be fighting against her through the first half of the story and then when they reach a point that heâ€™s willing to try, it gets deep quickly, which I had a hard time with because it never felt like a foundation was built between them to have such deep feelings.Regardless of my feelings of a missed connection, I enjoyed hanging out with Frisco, some of the Gallos and his buddies from the Neon Cowboy. The one feeling I always have when I read one of Blissâ€™ books is that thereâ€™s definitely a sense of love and camaraderie among the lead/secondary characters, which is illustrated through their banter and the playful antics they get into on a regular basis. A sense of family resonates off of the pages as they all willingly work to have each otherâ€™s back and even step over boundaries thinking itâ€™s for the otherâ€™s own good.I really hope Bearâ€™s story is up next because heâ€™s definitely an interesting character who has a lot to say regardless if anyone listens.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.3.5 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO0HP5ML5UINB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515152588#wasThisHelpful","RO0HP5ML5UINB","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Secretâ€™s Out is another great biker book from Lila Rose! It's a bit different from her other MC reads, which isn't a bad thing, and it actually fits the dynamic of the story quite well. The pace was a bit slower, but that part  also makes sense due to Josie's need to go slow and Pick and Eli understanding that fact and doing everything in their power to put her mind at ease while still showing her how much they love her and want her to be theirs.A relationship with two people with dark pasts and haunting demons is bad enough, but when you throw another person in the mix, one who may not have had as horrendous a past as the other two, but doesnâ€™t truly know the feeling of love, complications will arise and complex feelings will have to be dealt with in a way that doesnâ€™t alienate any of them.What I find most interesting about the dynamics between Josie, Pick, and Eli is that it actually seems like the only way a relationship will work between them is if itâ€™s all three of them - only two doesnâ€™t work because thereâ€™s too much darkness that could consume them; the right amount of light and feeling of home can only be provided in a triad relationship and Lila Rose does a great job of illustrating that fact throughout the course of the text.Josie Alexander is an interesting heroine; she may not be as confident or have a backbone like Roseâ€™s typical heroines, but the way she is able to survive and live on her own for so long dealing with the horrors of her past and the torment of her present proves how much of a fighter Josie is. And even though Josie didnâ€™t have to go it alone, I give her credit for wanting to prove to herself that she could.Pick and Eli - itâ€™s amazing how effortless it is for them to give Josie everything she needs not asking for anything in return. By having Josieâ€™s back together even when they thought there was no way for either one of them to have her as theirs is a testament to the type of men they are, despite the abuse Pick went through as a child and the loveless childhood that Eli had. I do wish the relationship/feelings between Pick and Eli was explored more; they had a few encounters and comments about how they felt for one another, but I wanted to feel their connection more...understand what it is that they gave one another without Josie in the middle.Regardless of my desire for a bit more from Roseâ€™s alpha men, The Secretâ€™s Out is a great spinoff of Roseâ€™s Hawks MC Club series, and I canâ€™t wait to see what she has in store for more of her tough and tortured heroes and kickbutt heroines.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22H6RWE1GK5VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016643XKC#wasThisHelpful","R22H6RWE1GK5VZ","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew Ren and Ashâ€™s journey to their happily ever after was going to be a tumultuous one because their entire relationship has been a battle of wills - each one wanting to dominate and unhinge the other one, but I didnâ€™t expect them to self destruct with minimal interference from others.Ren and Ash have both fought their personal demons, and they seemed to have overcome them, working together to support and encourage each other regardless of the set backs or frustrations that came along the way. Through all of the hardships and tests Ren and Ash have been through, their desire and love for each other has only evolved, but when Ash, once again, deals with his issues of abandonment and unworthiness alone, not allowing Ren to help or even know whatâ€™s going on in his head, the old wounds and worries rear their head again, forcing both of their volatile feelings to spike and leading them down a path that they may not be able to come back from unless Ash once and for all allows Ren completely in and Ren finally stops running away and starts fighting for her man.Iâ€™ve truly loved witnessing Ren and Ashâ€™s relationship from the very beginning. Thereâ€™s no one else that can give each other what they need, but thereâ€™s also a lot of obstacles to get past in order for them to have a fighting chance at making things work. Amity Cross allowed readers an insiderâ€™s look at the darkness within both Ren and Ash and how their easily provoked feelings could either be their saving grace or end up ruining any hope of being together. Both of them are fighters, which is clearly shown in their tenacity and work ethic, but Ren and Ash have short fuses and when things go down that they donâ€™t have control over, itâ€™s hard to determine how they will act and what those actions will mean for them when the dust settles.Spike brings Ren and Ashâ€™s story to a conclusion that readers will be satisfied with because Cross ensures that their ending still holds true to who Ren and Ash are at their core, which means that passion and all consuming sexual encounters dominate how they show each other how they feel and fierce fighting is how they work out their frustrations.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AH6WU8CPLMT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HF99AE#wasThisHelpful","R1AH6WU8CPLMT8","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lucas Titan is a man who gets what he wants, when he wants it, and allows no one to stand in his way, but he's finally put in his place by a sassy, strong woman who refuses to allow the scars of her past to rule her present. She will not cower to Titan's demands nor allow him to rule her life, but regardless of her disdain for him, her body wants his, and once they start, they just might be the only person for each other who can see beneath one another's regrets, pain, and facade.Holy Hell is Lucas Titan one arrogant jerk, but hereâ€™s the thing, he has EVERY right to be that way because heâ€™s a self made man who looks only to himself to build and grow his empire. Lucas thrives on control, power, and dominance, but he realizes that he also likes the challenge that Yve brings into his life, and as they give into their physical attraction for one another, Lucas and Yve slowly start to realize beneath each otherâ€™s tough exteriors is someone who longs unconditional love and someone at his/her back because regardless of how much they abhor asking anyone for help, they truly deserve respect, care, and comfort from someone who understands their scars and sees past them.Yve Santos has always been a bit of a mystery in Meghan Marchâ€™s Beneath series. But readers could tell without a doubt that sheâ€™s lived through a horrific past that puts her on edge, exacerbates her fears, and keeps a voice in her head that brings her to her knees with worthlessness. But Lucas Titan brings out her sass and bossiness, allowing her to gain back some of the control that she lost at the hands of her ex husband.I absolutely loved Beneath These Scars, and Lucas Titan is by far my favorite of Meghan Marchâ€™s heroes because he is who he is and he doesnâ€™t give a carp, at least externally, what others think about him. He may take drastic and underhanded steps to get what he wants, but thatâ€™s because heâ€™s used to taking care of himself and fighting tooth and nail for what he wants. His scars come from his relationship with his deceased father and every step he has taken since his fatherâ€™s death has been to prove that heâ€™s a better man than his father ever was in terms of his intelligence and drive to succeed. I never hated Lucas in the other books in the series because at some level, I understood his game plan and I saw that there was more to him than his duplicitous ways.I love the fact that readers get to witness Lucas and Yveâ€™s story through both of their perspectives because it allows us to truly see underneath all of their actions and attitudes; their love to hate relationship is both comical and incredibly hot because their explosive feelings are translated into sexy and spiteful interactions, making for one heck of a fun read.I dare readers to be introduced to Lucas Titan in Beneath These Scars and not find his take charge attitude and demanding personality hot as hell and totally worth his dominating ways!A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.5 poison apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKK0YN30Q7G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NAUJNE#wasThisHelpful","R3FKK0YN30Q7G9","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DesperateTo forgetTo pretend thereâ€™s no longer heartacheTo have someone whoâ€™s safe and constantDesperateTo dispel the demonsTo reinvent herself and become a better versionTo no longer feel guilty or ashamedChancesTo be redeemedTo fight for what is wantedTo let go of the pain and look forward instead of backThese are the desperate chances that Gracie Cook and Mitch Abrams cling to a year after one night of sex destroyed their friendship and turned them into strangers. But even after all that time, the regret and anger still controls them, forcing them to react instead of listen with the only conclusion being to remember what they once had and acknowledge that it will never be that way again.Boy did Gracie and Mitch frustrate me throughout most of their story! By allowing regret and betrayal to consume them, they never fought for each otherâ€¦they never tried to make one another understand what was at stake by walking away. Both of them are to blame for the outcome of that one night and the circumstances they now find themselves in because neither was willing to see the big picture, to understand the issues that drove Gracie to make a decision that tore Mitch away from her, and regardless of how blatantly obvious it is that Mitch is with Sophie for the wrong reasons and Gracie is now ready to give herself fully to Mitch and try again, neither will step up and fight for what they want, which led to even more lashing out and miscommunication.Mitch and GracieGracie and MitchThatâ€™s how itâ€™s supposed to be - not Mitch on one side and Gracie on the other, forcing their friends to feel the awkwardness of the situation, but sometimes people give up too easilyâ€¦.sometimes people overreact before really thinking about what theyâ€™re doing and then any chance they had was gone and all they have is what could have been.A Meredith Walters illustrates the ill effects of lost chances and the reality of desperate acts; she proves that settling and taking the safe route is never the best option when itâ€™s not what someone wants or needs. Regardless of the mistakes that Gracie and Mitch made, the time they spent apart allowed Gracie to reinvent herself â€“ to become a person who could prevent herself from self-destructing and with a clear mind, understand her truly feelings for Mitch and work to be the woman Mitch has always seen her as, even after all the time apart.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15BDVBXVUB0HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VOHOUS#wasThisHelpful","R15BDVBXVUB0HY","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To be a Casey, Hannah must exude perfection in order to keep the facade in place that the Caseys arenâ€™t anything but a respectable family. But thatâ€™s not the truth; in fact, itâ€™s far from it, and when tragedy strikes the Casey family yet again, the fractures start to show until it seems like itâ€™s an open sore, festering and oozing pain, sadness, and heartbreak. And all of those feelings threaten to suffocate Hannah until she learns to deal with whatâ€™s underneath the surface and the messy reality that sheâ€™s left with when everything is said and done.Even though Anything But Broken is told through both the hero and heroineâ€™s perspective, this is Hannahâ€™s story, and Joelle Knox does a great job of illustrating everything that Hannahâ€™s had to deal with by being a Casey and what it means for her future to simply be Hannah. Hannah is definitely a product of her parents' mandates and being exposed to that type of environment for so long forces her to lose who she really is, which is what she's desperately trying to figure out in Anything but Broken, but that canâ€™t occur until truths are revealed and a plan is put in place in order for her to realize that she no longer has to impress or work to not disappoint her family.Anything But Broken is definitely character driven, and thereâ€™s a lot to unpack and learn about Hannah and Sean, both individually and as a couple. Hannah trying to have a relationship with Sean, someone who knows all about the Casey family secrets, is not going to be easy especially since Sean has been on the receiving end of the Casey mandates.Hannah and Sean's issues will definitely resonate with readers and the emotional turmoil felt does illustrate what Hannah's going through, but I still didn't feel completely connected to the characters - I felt like their issues werenâ€™t fully examined; there were steps taken towards Hannah reclaiming herself and Sean letting go of past regrets, but I needed a bit more insight so that I could clearlyunderstand everything that had to be dealt with before the new Hannah could be completely born.Even days after reading Anything But Broken, Iâ€™m not sure how I feel about Hannah and Sean's story. At times, it was slow moving and I felt lost in Hannahâ€™s despair and the way she was coping with that feeling. Other times, Hannah and Seanâ€™s torment resonated off the pages and I was right there with them dealing with the aftermath of harsh revelations.  Both Hannah and Sean are dealing with large amounts of regret and guilt, but they find solace in each other despite their shared pasts. Joelle Knox makes it clear why they find comfort by being together, but I just didn't feel like they dealt with their individual issues enough for them to move forward together. I guess I felt like it was more a work in progress and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that, but I just wanted to feel like Hannah and Sean were going to make it no matter what, and I didnâ€™t.A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.3.5 poison apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KTBYYOFGZDG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141KJL1S#wasThisHelpful","R3KTBYYOFGZDG7","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a man who doesnâ€™t do complicated and avoids distractions like theyâ€™re the plague, Jake sure knows how to muddy the waters when it comes to a certain woman and her 6 orphaned nieces and nephews. Sure, he fought his attraction to her as best he could because he knew getting involved with Chelsea and the kids would be a major disturbance to his neat and easy lifestyle, but thereâ€™s definitely more to Jake than his defense attorney persona, and thatâ€™s the man that Chelsea and the kids allow Jake to be, which is exactly why Jake Becker just might be my favorite Emma Chase alpha male!Readers all know that Emma Chase creates amazing male characters who may be a bit tarnished and rough of the edges but theyâ€™re also men who refuse to settleâ€¦who do what it takes to get the victory each and every time, and the ultimate win for them is finding a woman who fits them and their lifestyle and isnâ€™t afraid to fight back for what they want. Jake Becker epitomizes that description even if he doesnâ€™t really realize it until later on in the story.Because Sustained is told solely through Jakeâ€™s perspective, readers are privy to all insider information. We understand his perceptive and intelligent mind and how it worksâ€¦we clearly see how much he cares and sympathizes with others and what heâ€™s willing to do to fix things when no one else seems to want to step up. Jake may be a criminal defense attorney who â€œoutsmartsâ€ and â€œout maneuversâ€ his opponents with ease, but thereâ€™s so much more to him, and with his interaction with Chelsea and her clan of kids as well as his internal musings about them and the situation he finds himself in, we truly get to know the real Jake not just the tenacious lawyer hellbent on a win.Chelsea and her nieces and nephews definitely stole my heart. Iâ€™m a sucker for books with kids in them, and Emma Chase does a fantastic job of illustrating Jake and Chelseaâ€™s interactions with them. There are multiple kid moments in the story where I was swooning over how Jake handled them and other times, my heart broke for the pain those kids felts in losing their parents and trying to cope. The kids added a whole other layer of greatness to the book and made readers feel like a part of their family.I absolutely loved Jake's story; it was amazing to witness Jake's transformation, and while there were setbacks, and I wanted to punch him a time or two, he steps up in really big ways and learns to love the idea of commitment and more.Emma Chase once again proves why she reigns as a writer of the male pov, but even more than that, her character and relationship building in Sustained is phenomenal, and itâ€™s part of the reason why Iâ€™ll always read her stories!A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XSSL3CAC0R14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WQF6#wasThisHelpful","R1XSSL3CAC0R14","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Griff's story has two plot lines that center around his past catching up with his present, both in ways that will definitely change his position in Storm as well as his need to keep women at a distance, not allowing any attachment on his or their part.Club business and past misdeeds are to blame for the trouble brewing in Storm and a certain honest and sexy woman is responsible for Griff reconsidering getting in deep with another woman again, but Griff's got his work cut out for him in order to fix his mess with Storm, and with Sophia, he's going to have to realize that not every girl is like his lying ex.The Storm MC is at a bit of an impasse - the clubâ€™s loyalty is split; Scott and Griff are fighting like hell to bring Storm back to a united band of brothers, but thatâ€™s easier said than done when not everyone agrees with Scott or Griffâ€™s position in the club. Adding to that is Griffâ€™s reasons for becoming a member of Storm and the revelations that can not only put Griffâ€™s membership in question but it could also mean adding to the crap thatâ€™s already going down around the club.Sophia is my kind of heroine. Her life has not been easy, but she tries to put her past behind her and focus on what she wants and deserves in the present. Sheâ€™s a rambler who gives nothing but pure honesty in every encounter. What you see is what you get with Sophia, which is exactly the kind of girl Griff needs in his life.Sophia and Griff donâ€™t hit it off right away because Griff doesnâ€™t see her as being someone who can deal with the no strings approach that he has down to a science, but soon, Sophiaâ€™s turning the tables on him and he finds that her lightness might be exactly what his darkness needs.Nina Levine definitely brings the feels in the newest installment of her Storm MC series. Readers feel Sophia and Griffâ€™s heartache over their pasts as well as their tension and frustration when they have to deal with people/situations from their past invading their present.Levine does a great job of moving Storm MCâ€™s issues forward and what Scott and his brothers are doing to make that happen. A lot goes down with the club in Illusive as well as with Griffâ€™s personal life, and the two story lines work well together, giving Griff something to fight for outside of the club and realizing that the past doesnâ€™t have to be the only part of your story.Thereâ€™s mention in the text about what Harlow and Scott are dealing with, and since the 6th book in the series, Command, finishes their story. Iâ€™ll anxiously be waiting to see how everything works out between them and what new situations the club will find themselves in with chaos coming in from all different directions.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 poison apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRVJV95DUEIP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPCLT0S#wasThisHelpful","RRVJV95DUEIP5","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Slammer is the ultimate jacked up read, and the journey to the truth and heart of who and what X, Christopher Jacobs, was and became is deliciously dark, erotic, and all kinds of messed up.Itâ€™s true that prison is its own black hole; it controls, manipulates, and tortures its inhabitants, even those who are not behind bars. Itâ€™s a place where personal convictions and morals have no place and physical freedom is only part of what the darkness takes away from the convicted who dwell there. Regardless of the the type of monstrous men the criminals were on the outside, being locked up feeds the beast, unleashing its fury in a multitude of messed up ways.One of the things that I love about Slammer is that Tabatha Vargo provides both perspectives of prison life at Fulton Rhodes Penitentiary - those who are the convicted criminals and those who are there to protect, treat, and keep the prisoners in line. But what she also illustrates is that sometimes those lines blur and those who are meant to protect and serve wind up only serving themselves and their own vile vices.Vargo doesnâ€™t sugar coat anything when it comes to the actions and words of the murderers and rapists who are contained in each cell. She provides a realistic look at the deprive souls and how much further theyâ€™ve gone into the darkness of their souls by entering prison - a place that is kill or be killedâ€¦an environment where if you donâ€™t belong to someone, thereâ€™s an x on your back from the startâ€¦a territory that exists and functions by its own set of rules and where everyone must prove their worth in one soulless act or another.This domain is where Christopher Jacobs became X - a beast of a man with enough anger built up inside of him that could destroy anyone in his path. Heâ€™s the man to take down in prison and heâ€™s always up to the challenge. As much as Fulton creates X, Lyla, the new registered nurse at the prison, allows small glimpses of Christopher to still break through the monster mask, and this is where the storyâ€™s complexity builds because how can a young, innocent woman be attracted to someone who brutally murdered two people unless there were qualities about him that showed a different side of who X is?The growing attraction between Lyla and X is clearly illustrated through their limited time in the infirmary and the risks theyâ€™re both taking to act on those feelings, but the complexity of their relationship is just not the fact that itâ€™s occurring inside the prison walls where X has been sentenced to life in prison, but itâ€™s also in the risks that Lyla takes to prove X is so much more than a convicted murderer. This part of the story is extremely well written; itâ€™s fast paced, mind bending, and dangerous, and readers will not see/understand how it ends until theyâ€™re forced to face the truth of the situation and then looking back, theyâ€™ll wonder why they never thought of that conclusion. These kinds of stories are the ones I absolutely love because I can form various theories and feel like Iâ€™m on the right track, which keeps my interest in the story steadfast, and then when itâ€™s revealed, Iâ€™m completely blown away because I never anticipated it!Is Slammer not for everyone? Absolutely! Readers definitely need to heed the Vargoâ€™s warning! Itâ€™s a dark read that provides perspective on the inner workings of dangerous criminals and what they do in order to claim some kind of status in the prison. When morals donâ€™t factor into the equation of actions then anything goes and that is exactly the case at Fulton Penitentiary.So go into X and Lylaâ€™s story knowing that you will be privy to sinister and disgusting acts, and they absolutely will make your skin crawl and your stomach nauseous, but Slammer will also rock your world with its well crafted and intriguing plot line and its complex characters.Itâ€™s a definite mindjolt but in the best way possible!A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.5 poison apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQCZ71Z6V12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145TLATG#wasThisHelpful","R2AQCZ71Z6V12","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Felicity's story is definitely not what I expected from the synopsis and title, but the way J.J. McAvoy delivers it and the information that is revealed - facts that I never saw coming - makes Sugar Baby Beautiful a fantastic read about so much more than having someone provide a lifestyle simply by looking good in his/her presence.Felicity Harper is quite the enigmaâ€¦from the very beginning, readers can tell that thereâ€™s more to her that what she allows people, even readers, to see. Sheâ€™s hellbent on concealing her past by not allowing anyone to know too much about her. This is how Felicity copes with the life sheâ€™s been dealtâ€¦from a mistake that forces her to punish herself by losing things that she loved. Even though Felicityâ€™s not content with how sheâ€™s living, she canâ€™t risk moreâ€¦she canâ€™t handle giving herself to someone because sheâ€™s scared at what might happen if she does.But Felicity never counted on meeting Theodore Darcy - an alpha male whoâ€™s used to getting what he wants, and he most definitely wants Felicity in his bedâ€¦in his lifeâ€¦any way he can have her. Thereâ€™s a lot to know and understand about Theo, and J.J. McAvoy slowly unravels the mystery behind the possessive billionaire and what heâ€™s willing to risk to keep the woman whose made him come to life. But Theoâ€™s not the only one with layers to his personality; in fact, Felicity seems much more elusive, and as clues to her past filter into her present, itâ€™s still extremely difficult to construct a big picture understanding because thereâ€™s parts to her that still remain unknown.Sugar Baby Beautiful is my first read by J.J. McAvoy, so I didnâ€™t quite know what to expect from her writing style or characters, but I have to say that I love the fact that nothing is transparent in her storytelling. McAvoy takes the story in one direction, but then turns it on its side in order to progress the way that she wants, and she does that with her characters as well. All of the characters seem to hold their cards tightly to their chest, never giving everything at once, always making people work to see who they are and what theyâ€™re all about, and to me, those are the best types of characters because readers get to experience the charactersâ€™ evolvement, and as revelations are brought out, because weâ€™ve been watching everything seamlessly unfold in the way that McAvoy wants it to, the ah ha moment astonishes us - at least at first - but then when we take a moment to rewind the events of the story, we see small clues sprinkled about just waiting to be acknowledged, but they canâ€™t be until McAvoy allows readers to see a clear picture, which she does by building the story the way that she wants to and making it intriguing as itâ€™s constructed.Canâ€™t wait to dive into more stories by J.J.

"Nicole Edwards writes fantastic books; there hasnâ€™t been one that I havenâ€™t enjoyed. Sheâ€™s definitely the Queen of menage, but sheâ€™s also one of my go to authors for M/M reads and the solid writing and fantastic character development in Never Say Never is one of the main reasons that I canâ€™t get enough of her hot alpha males who fight hard and play even harder.â€œNever Say Neverâ€ - itâ€™s definitely a good motto to live by, and for Zachariah â€œZâ€ Tavoularis, itâ€™s one that allows him to weather the storm that his long time crush and boss, Ryan Trexler, forces him to go through as RT fights his attraction to Z because he refuses to mix business with pleasure ever again after the debacle that occurred three years ago with Kevin. But the heart and body want what they want and as much as Ryan forces himself to not allow emotions/lust to influence his decisions, Zâ€™s pull is too much for him to combat, but if Ryan doesnâ€™t get out of his own head, it might just ruin the best thing to ever happen to him before it ever really begins.Most of the time, Iâ€™m a first person point of view reader; I don't usually feel like I get inside characters' heads when the story is written in third person, but Edwards always manages to reveal everything to readers through her meticulous character evolvement. Readers actually learn more about Z than his co workers and friends know about him because heâ€™s such a private person so theyâ€™ve had to establish their own views on his life, which are definitely a misrepresentation of who Z is and even Ryan is guilty of this skewed view.The secondary story line is the whole reason Ryan and Z are forced to face their feelings for one another, and itâ€™s a great backdrop for them to consider what risks theyâ€™re willing to take in order to have the man they want.Z and Ryan definitely sizzle when they're together; theyâ€™re both control freaks, so itâ€™s interesting to see how they both attempt to top from the bottom. The way Edwards writes their sexual encounters as well as their lust filled foreplay is enough to make any reader weak in the knees and wet in the panties.I canâ€™t fault Ryan for his uneasiness in pursuing a relationship with Z even one of a sexual nature. Edwards definitely makes it clear where Ryan is coming from, but that doesn't mean his actions didn't frustrate the heck out of me. His hot and cold demeanor and the pain it caused Z definitely didnâ€™t sit well with me.I have to say that I love Z and everything that makes him who he is; heâ€™s an incredibly trustworthy and caring man who everybody wants to be around because he has a certain charisma about him that pulls people to his side.Never Say Never is a sexy, angsty and suspenseful read whose main and secondary characters know how to have a good time and get the job done. I was rooting for Ryan and Z from the very beginning, but I knew that Ryan was going to have to work things out for himself before he woke up to what he was missing out on by resisting Zâ€™s charms.I canâ€™t wait to see which alpha is up next!A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 poison apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBI1N36MDXX6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011GDT154#wasThisHelpful","RBI1N36MDXX6I","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cocky Bastard was not the book I expected it to be....well, it was because Chance definitely is one self assured son of a bitch, but there's so much more to this story than his swagger - the second half of the book shows a much different Chance than the first half, which only adds to his magnetism and appeal. Don't get me wrong, Chance still delivers the one liners and sexual innuendoes, but readers also observe his determination...his persistence...his need to make amends for what happened even if his plan doesn't pan out, and that's the Chance that readers will swoon over.Both Chance and Aubrey are at a crossroads in their life, and although they have very different reasons for feeling adrift, they go into their cross country trip with every intention to make the most of it - fainting goat and all. But once the adventure is finished is when everything gets complicated, and itâ€™s up to Cocky and Princess to figure out whatâ€™s between them and what theyâ€™re willing to do to keep their exploits going.Cocky Bastard is a highly entertaining story about adventure, second chances, redemption, and finding oneâ€™s true path. The second half is a bit angsty, and some of Chance and Aubreyâ€™s actions drove me nuts, but mistrust is a significant obstacle to overcome and thereâ€™s bound to be mixed signals. I like that the first half of the book is told from Aubreyâ€™s point of view because sheâ€™s the one who has made a life changing decision and itâ€™s her chance to find herself, but then the second half turns to Chanceâ€™s perspective, which also makes sense because heâ€™s the one who now has a chance to change his life forever and heâ€™s bound and determined to do so.Penelope Ward and Vi Keeland are must read authors in their own right, so putting their fantastic minds together in Cocky Bastard makes for a book of hilarity, steam, and drama!A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBEIE9TFD9IC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014005B72#wasThisHelpful","R1KBEIE9TFD9IC","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holy Hell! Officer Ben Kelly and his pretty girl, Mia, have to be one of the hottest and sweetest couples I have ever read about. Their affection and desire for each other resonates off of every page! They're it for each other and their life is everything they hoped it would be...except a little one on one time is definitely something they could use more of;)I loved getting more of Ben and Mia's story and their growing family. Nolan is still as precious as he was when he was three, and he loves his brother, Chase, something fierce. The idea of finding time to be a couple when you have kids is definitely something readers will relate to; I'm sure everyone has been c**k blocked by their children one time or another, and sometimes people have to get quite creative in order to have sex. The sizzle between Ben and Mia is as hot as ever and J. Daniels illustrates their connection with their dirty comments, need to constantly touch each other, and the internal musings about how lucky they are to have each other.I adore this series and J.

"Forsaken - the title of Chadâ€™s story is quite fitting, in both positive and negative ways and on a number of levels. For six years, Chad has felt abandoned, almost giving up hope that this deadly game heâ€™s been playing will ever have the outcome he needs to keep Amy out of danger; heâ€™s foregone getting close to anyone that can be used against him, learning the hard way that everyone has their own agenda. Chad has  also given up his quest for money in his treasure hunting endeavors, taking up a new agenda - one that is for more than just himself, which is definitely out of character for him as a treasure hunter but not as the man who vows to protect those closest to him. Chad is a lone wolf so to speak on this journey to outwit those who paid him to find the cylinder and heâ€™ll continue to go it alone until he figures out a way to keep it out of their hands.I've been anxiously waiting for Chad to come out of hiding and end this war, so he could ensure his sisterâ€™s safety. I love that Lisa Renee Jones wrote Forsaken in only Chad's perspective - itâ€™s his warâ€¦his wrong to rightâ€¦his payback for what happened to his family. Gia definitely is an important part of the story line, but I see her, in a way, as Chadâ€™s redemption, because his journey to this point is tainted with mistrust, secrets, and a large amount of danger. Gia humanizes Chad, forcing him to see beyond this war and what he could have when everything is said and done.Enemies are coming from multiple directions, and Chad needs to decide what the best course of action is, forcing him to go outside his comfort zone and put trust, even it is a bit forced, in someone other than himself. Chad is full of guilt and rage and that drives him forward to end this game and find a way to protect his sister and Gia as well as the treasure that everyone wants to get their hands on. Chad's circle of trust expands in Forsaken, but as much as it seems things are headed in the right direction, there's still work to be done and bringing Liam Stone into the equation seems to be advantageous for everyone, including readers, because Iâ€™m sure weâ€™re all dying for more Liam!Forsaken is romantic suspense at its finest. With all the twists and turns the story takes, itâ€™s hard to know for sure who the good and bad guys are, but by the end of the text, it becomes clearer the steps that need to be taken to allow Chad, Gia, Amy, and Liam to have a life outside of the protective walls they have created.I canâ€™t wait to see how everything comes together in Unbroken!A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R316HUSI1YLR7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WUZC#wasThisHelpful","R316HUSI1YLR7H","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's no such thing as perfect timing, but for Grace and Matt, time was just one variable not working in their favor...missed opportunities, outside interference, and a multitude of regrets and what ifs have led them to 15 years of wondering what the other is doing and why they just couldn't get it right.In a way, Before We Were Strangers reminds me of the movie Sliding Doors. The heroine faces a decision that could lead her down two paths, and those journeys are shown in a parallel way throughout the film. Grace and Matt have personal and professional goals that could lead them down a path as a couple or one as individuals working to make a name for themselves in their fields of choice, but it seems as if the option they choose will categorically define them for years to come and force them down very different roads.After Grace and Mattâ€™s connection in college was torn apart, their lives went down parallel tracks that for many years never intersected, but through all the time they were traveling their own roads, they never stopped thinking about one another, leading them to believe that their story wasnâ€™t finishedâ€¦that the ending they had all those years ago was not supposed to be the conclusion to their relationship.But Grace and Mattâ€™s second chance at love is a rather bumpy one that leads to moments of rejection, despair, and life changing revelations. They both have to learn who they are now and not hold on too much to who they were before because looking back wonâ€™t move them forward.Renee Carlino does a great job of meticulously weaving Grace and Mattâ€™s present and past, examining the emotional impact for both of them. The reality of their situation is hard for them to accept, and readers will feel the exact same way because a love like theirs - one thatâ€™s real and seems so seamless - should not have been destroyed so easily. But what Carlino shows as well is that life is messy and choices made have a domino effect, in both positive and negative ways, and perhaps, the only way Grace and Matt could reunite and have a second chance at love is for them to have parted and lived separate lives, allowing for growth and understanding and forcing them both to realize that even when they were apart, they were never truly strangers because they still held each other in their hearts.A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.4.5 poison apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4MC3CP6HN6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O65X7MI#wasThisHelpful","RL4MC3CP6HN6T","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"King, Doe, Bear, and even Preppy's witty back talk are present in the follow up story to King and s*** definitely gets messed up in immensely dark and dangerous ways, but if readers have learned anything about King, itâ€™s that he comes alive when his backâ€™s up against a wall.Heâ€™s the King of the Causewayâ€¦the notorious Brantley Kingâ€¦the mother ***ing bad guy, and heâ€™ll do what he has to do to reclaim the girl who owns him and make everyone pay for taking her away from him by any means necessary. King has had his life messed up enough and heâ€™s going to damn well make sure that whoever messes with him and his pays for it in the harshest way possible.There's a lot on the line for more than just King and Doe; all the players involved have different objectives, meaning secrets, lies, and mayhem are the name of the game. King not only as to contend with Doeâ€™s father double crossing him, but he also has blow back from his actions in King. T.M. Frazier does a great job of demonstrating that Kingâ€™s lifestyle comes with repercussions, so as much as he wants to focus on Doe, he ultimately doesnâ€™t have that luxury because the s***  heâ€™s stirred up is ready to explode. But this is when King is at his best, allowing the darkness to consume him and do what needs to be done.In a way, King was about King's recognition that he's more than just a criminalâ€¦that he actually has a heart, and Doe allowed him to figure that out. The book proves how complex King is and how being with Doe opens up a part of himself that he had beaten back because of the s***storm that was his life. Tyrant is more Doe's transformation. She can no longer be HER, but she also can't completely be who she was with King because as her memory comes back and everything becomes clearer, Doe comes to a new understanding about her life and the direction it's heading and who will be with her for the ride.T.M. Frazier is truly a gifted writer; her ability to weave a story that is both dark and dangerous as well as witty and charming is a feat that not many authors can perfect and she does it every time she crafts a tale. I canâ€™t get enough of her multi-dimensional characters who are complete enigmas for what theyâ€™ve been through and how they react to their circumstances, and to me, Preppy, is the ultimate sidekick who continues to be felt and heard even after he goes off to have his own party!The EPILOGUE about ruined me!

"Iâ€™m a bit torn on this one. The book started a bit slow for me, and I had a hard time understanding the true connection Vaughn and Smoke have other than their respective lust for one another. It seems like they settle everything by having sex, thinking it might be their last encounter.  I needed a bit more discussion and insight to fully feel the intensity of Vaughn and Smokeâ€™s feelings; I wanted to be shown the progress of their relationship, and in a way, I felt like it was told to me instead.Donâ€™t get me wrongâ€¦I enjoyed reading Vaughn and Smokeâ€™s story. Both characters worked for me as individual heroes struggling to find their own way and be comfortable with themselves and their choices. Lee does a good job of exploring that idea and forcing them to question what really matters and the cost of not owning up to who you are, but the various threads of the story line didnâ€™t work that well for me; there was enough to figure out just based on the environment these two men were a part of and what they felt for each other so some parts of it felt like forced issues. But I also understand that Lee had a certain vision in mind, and she used the avenues that she felt would illustrate her points best and even if I didnâ€™t envision it the way she did that doesnâ€™t undervalue Vaughn and Smokeâ€™s story because big picture wise, I liked it a lot, and it shed light on issues the definitely deserve discussion in todayâ€™s society.The Darkest Flame was actually my first book by Christina Lee, and one thing I learned about her writing is that she sure knows how to write some hot as hell m/m sex scenes! Both Vaughn and Smoke are alpha males who need control and that commanding presence is acted on in the bedroom. For two men who wanting to do the owning, though, they also felt owned by one another, which made their sexual chemistry sizzle.If youâ€™re looking for a book with two sinfully hot alpha male heroes who canâ€™t help but crave one anotherâ€™s touch despite everything that seems to stand in their way then Vaughn and Smokeâ€™s story is definitely one to one-click!A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.3.5/4 Poison Apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVZLVV63P78W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GVCA2A#wasThisHelpful","R2VVZLVV63P78W","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One's ability to let something go regardless of how big or small the situation is says a lot about the strength and character of that person. Whether it be letting go of regrets, guilt, or hurt feelings, life is a lot freer if someone is not burdened with those dark feelings. But being able to let go is a lot easier said than done because even if it makes sense logically, the mind is a complex part of the human body and when emotions are involved, people tend to allow those feelings to consume them.This principle holds true for the main characters of J.A. Redmerskiâ€™s newest release The Moment of Letting Go, and while Luke is the handsome and carefree guy who wants to help Sienna not to overthink and fight her fears while sheâ€™s in the lush and beautiful island of Hawaii, Luke himself needs those reminders as well because his ability to move on after a significant loss is something that is definitely holding him back from living his life to the fullest.On paper, Luke and Sienna couldnâ€™t be more different. Luke is a risk taker who finds a sense of freedom participating in extreme sports and releasing himself from the confines of the business world. Sienna overthinks everything and lives to work because she is defined by her success at her job and not much else.Luke and Sienna take one another outside their comfort zones: Lukeâ€™s walls start to break down as Sienna becomes someone important to him; someone who makes him feel more than he wants to because the fear of letting her in and her not accepting him is not something he wants to endure. Sienna starts to question everything about her life and if she has the confidence to let her old life go and move on to something that would satisfy her completely.Thereâ€™s a great message in Luke and Siennaâ€™s story about finding a way for people to unburden themselves and live life to the fullest. But in order to do something so grand, thereâ€™s definitely going to be conflict and tension, especially for two people who donâ€™t know each other well and live completely different lives.Iâ€™m a huge fan of J.A. Redmerskiâ€™s writing; her ability to write in multiple genres illustrates her diversity as an author. Her New Adult stories carry significant themes in them about life and how it should be lived regardless individual situations. The Moment of Letting Go is thought provoking and uplifting because it proves that life is about so much more than work and money and in order to live instead of merely to exist, people need to experience EVERYTHING life has to offer before itâ€™s too late.A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.4 poison apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TT14GJRQOF90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU3RNBW#wasThisHelpful","R1TT14GJRQOF90","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am darkness. I am pain. I am mother f***ing death.Flame absolutely epitomizes darkness; he gets off on pain, and he thirsts for blood.  They provide him the release he needs and subdues the voice thatâ€™s constantly fracturing his mind. The voice of the devil himself; the one whoâ€™s responsible for creating a man who purges the flames inside him with one of his many knives.Maddie had her innocence stripped from her, and itâ€™s something that has forced her to shut down and become a recluse, living her life on pages instead of in reality,  fearing a manâ€™s touch and the simplest interactions. Her light was taken from her, which makes the fact that she found some bit of comfort and protection from a dark and tortured soul.Flame and Maddie's story was everything I had hoped it would be. Tillie Cole does a fantastic job of vividly illustrating how Flame and Maddieâ€™s separate journeys brought them to a place where they felt safe enough to mend the shattered fragments of their bodies and minds.  Cole expertly demonstrates that regardless of how fractured someone isâ€¦regardless of the fear and rage that dominates his/her entire being, as long as there is someone who sees that person as s/he truly is - a clear perception that is not distorted by nightmarish memories or twisted words - thereâ€™s hope that the flames and darkness will not truly destroy, and by the end of the text, readers will understand that Maddie has the power to keep the flames calm and Flame is the only person who can help Maddie to feel safe.As the other books in Coleâ€™s Hades Hangmen series, the subject matter and situations are not for the faint of heart, but they are essential in understanding everything that Flame and Maddie endured at the hands of deplorable men. There is no way to truly grasp the irreparable damage that was done to them without capturing it through meticulous description, which is exactly what Tille Cole provides her readers. Through Flame and Maddieâ€™s memories, every demonic act vividly comes to life, forcing readers to feel everything that they felt and endure the pain, torture, and cruelty that was done to them.As dark and painful as Flame and Maddieâ€™s story is, itâ€™s also a beautiful display of courage, trust, and transformation. Maddie is an amazingly strong character  a â€œpint sized warriorâ€ â€” someone who can withstand the flames and save the man who from the very beginning claimed her as his Maddie. Itâ€™s hard to define the kind of man Flame was made into due to what happened in his past, but whatâ€™s clear is that with Maddie by his side, he grows to understand that being different is not the same as being evil, and as much as he is an instrument of destruction, Flame also has the power to bring someone back to life.Souls Unfractured is writing at its finest. Every part of the story is essential to its plot line and the text clearly demonstrates Flame and Maddieâ€™s transformation. Itâ€™s evident in every word thatâ€™s written that Tillie Cole poured her soul into writing Flame and Maddieâ€™s story and that she left a piece of herself in there with him and thereâ€™s not a reader out there who wonâ€™t feel like they left a part of themselves in there as well.

"Overtime is definitely an emotional read, which makes perfect sense because there's a lot of pain and scars to try to heal between Jordie and Kacey, and Toni Aleo's writing makes readers feel EVERYTHING!Overtime is seamlessly written...all of the struggles, on both sides, were completely realistic and written in a way that forces readers to fight through their own emotions while reading Jordie and Kacey's story. There is a bit of outside interference that threatens to undo all of the work that Jordie and Kacey accomplish throughout the duration of the text, but for the most part, Jordieâ€™s recovery and making amends as well as his and Kaceyâ€™s growth as people and as a couple are the driving force of the text.Toni Aleo captures Jordie's torment so well through her word choice and characterization. I sensed his anguish, his desperation, his desire to change. Readers can feel is struggle resonating from the pages, and the torment that threatens to seduce him back to his old ways of coping, but the one overpowering characteristic that illustrates Jordie besides all of the negative ones that have owned him for many years is his determination. Jordie doesnâ€™t want to fail again; he doesnâ€™t want to bring anyone down, especially Kacey. The new Jordie, the one heâ€™s hellbent of becoming, owns up to his mistakes and makes good on his promises.Kacey is just as conflicted as Jordie, but in a much different way; she loves Jordie with everything that she has, but she canâ€™t forget how he treated her and casted her aside so easily. She also has her own demons to navigate through and those fears and doubts play a big role in Kaceyâ€™s hot and cold demeanor around Jordie. I canâ€™t blame Kacey for her trepidation and hesitancy. Like Jordie, she has a lot to lose if they canâ€™t make a go at a new relationship. Toni Aleo does a great job of illustrating all of the negative thoughts that overwhelm Kaceyâ€™s psyche, and for much of the story, she allows those ill feelings to consume her and to drive her to make decisions that are definitely not in her best interest.  But just like Jordie, Kacey has to learn for herself what itâ€™s going to take to move forward instead of holding on to the baggage of the past.Jordie has a huge battle to win, for himself and for Kacey, and it's not an easy journey, and it shouldn't be because addiction is all consuming, and it dominates and destroys. But this is Jordieâ€™s last shot with Kacey and in the final minutes of a game, thatâ€™s when Jordieâ€™s the best at what he does, so he knows heâ€™s got this because he refuses to allow his demons to once again obliterate what he needs to live!I've read a lot of Toni Aleo's books, and I think Overtime is her best book so far. I devoured Jordie and Kaceyâ€™s story, and as frustrated and angered as I was with Jordieâ€™s actions in Wanting to Forget, in Overtime, I was in absolute awe of his determination and dedication at becoming someone he and his family could be proud of, and boy does he make his overtime minutes count!A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.5+ Poison Apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUWBYWBKKEBGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111EOXRO#wasThisHelpful","RUWBYWBKKEBGX","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A sweet and dirty girl whoâ€™s looking to settle down.An alpha male who fights fires and protects his heart with casual hook ups.Two weeks. No strings. No future.But what happens when feelings become part of the deal and threaten to consume both of them? Will they allow their agreement to fizzle out or will they keep it burning long after the two weeks is up?Travis and Caraâ€™s story is a quick and steamy read that shows what happens when two people who have always shared a connection refuse to accept whatâ€™s staring right in front of them. Thereâ€™s not a whole lot of angst, which is good because forced drama in a story doesnâ€™t work for me. The story is more about why Travis is afraid to commit and why, if he finally decides to give into his feelings, Cara is the perfect choice.Right from the start, readers can sense the sexual tension between Travis and Cara and their true desires that are just below the surface. Lauren Blakely does a great job of illustrating how compatible they are by their witty banter and passionate encounters, and Blakely brings readers along to experience every consuming moment Travis and Cara share.Consumed By You is a great addition to the Fighting Fire series because it proves that some fires shouldnâ€™t be put out; they should actually be stoked, increasing the heat and sizzle to the point that itâ€™s scorching.A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.4 poison apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DI7EXMT9LGM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7S52H2#wasThisHelpful","R3DI7EXMT9LGM3","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew as soon as I finished Priest that I needed to get back to Sierra Simone's writing as soon as possible, and when this beauty of a box set was offered up for review, I couldn't wait to delve back into Simone's complex and conflicted characters immersed in a connection that is perverse and immoral by society's standards, but it's also one that the main characters can't get enough of because regardless of how wrong society deems it to be, it's what they crave and need in order to feel whole.In Victorian Society, appearance and social status mean everything - at least that's the facade that must be presented to the eyes of society - those who wield the power to help a woman rise or fall in terms of society's approval. But behind closed doors, individuals' baser needs are explored - it's a place where nothing is deemed uncouth because no one is there to judge - they are there to experience, experiment, and hold nothing back because the constraints of society do not matter.This is the sensual world Ivy Leavold is thrust into when she becomes an impoverished woman without a home, and her cousin's widower takes her into his home, Markham Hall. It is a place where Ivy is awakened, educated, punished, and reborn, and readers are privy to everything that Ivy welcomes and endures as she gives herself over to her wildest desires and finds the other half of her soul in a man who both loves and wants to tame her wildness - Julian Markham.But carnal sins are not the only transgressions to occur in Markham Hall. There's a darkness and mystery that surrounds the manor and its owner as well as a plethora of rumored indiscretions and dangerous tendencies.  Ivy has wholeheartedly given herself over to Mr. Markham's teachings, but they come at a price and have Ivy questioning everything that makes her feel alive, forcing her to become introspective and understand if what she wants and needs is truly worth the risk.Sierra Simone explores the human condition at its rawest and most carnal, and I love that she does so in a society that holds themselves in such high regards in terms of their standards and perceived way of living. Ivy is the perfect woman to become the explorer of this unspoken society because she has not been forced into the moral ways of the times. She's been fairly secluded from everything due to the loss of her parents and the ineptitude of her now deceased brother, so in a way, she is ripe for the picking, but only those who have a side to them that is drawn to the kind of impropriety Mr. Markham and his friends partake in can be lured as far in as Ivy goes.Julian Markham is quite the mysterious character through much of the first book, but once Ivy is immersed into his world and has given herself over to his teachings, readers learn more of his baser needs and desires and the reasons behind his dark and dangerous demeanor. It made perfect sense to me why Simone held off on providing readers with Julian's perspective until Ivy had committed herself to him. We could not be privy to all that is Julian Markham until he got what he wanted from Ivy. Once readers do gain that insight, though, things seem to get more complicated and further questions arise as to his choices and dalliances, but what we also see is that Ivy is truly the woman who completes him...who allows him to show all of himself and not be judged or scorned for what he needs.Sierra Simone clearly illustrates what both Ivy and Julian get out of their painful/pleasurable encounters and proves that something that allows them both to experience love at its rawest and most basic form should not be judged by others because it's a huge part of who they are and what makes them feel alive.I absolutely adored the Markham Hall series; it is an intensely provocative and captivating journey that Simone takes Ivy and Julian on, which also contains a good amount of mystery, deception, and drama. I'm so glad that I read the series when it was completed because I would have been incredibly frustrated by where the books stopped, which is a bad thing for me, but it also shows that Simone's writing and character development leave me wanting more, which is never a bad thing!A complimentary copy was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.5 poison apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R236SZOKV70P71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XCJQ334#wasThisHelpful","R236SZOKV70P71","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Flash Bang is the perfect title for what happens to Rowan Callahan when a complete power grid failure sends the United States into a post-apocalyptic situation. Good thing for Rowan, her father is a doomsday prepper, so she knows exactly what needs to be done in order to survive and head back to her family home. But on her way, thatâ€™s when her life takes a new direction, and she finds herself wanting a relationship that she would have never considered before - one that would be considered taboo in modern society, but with what has happened to society, it seems only fitting that people rely on their own desires to find happiness in the chaos that has ensued and thatâ€™s exactly what she plans to do - peopleâ€™s opinions be damned.I absolutely loved Rowan! She is a kicka** heroine who can hold her own in almost any situation. When she arrives on Castle Creek Whitetail Ranch, she has every intention to flee and make it home to her family - the people she has let down far too often in her life - despite the fact that there are two strong and handsome men who stake a claim for her body and her heart.Zach and Graham are the perfect pair for Rowan because they bring different qualities into their relationship. They are definitely both alpha males and take know how to take control, but they also play off of each otherâ€™s personality, enabling both of them to get what they want. Zach is more of a carefree guy than Graham is, which works well because Graham is a bit high strung. But regardless of how quick tempered Graham is, heâ€™s also incredibly protective and yearns to have someone put him first for once in his life.I love that Meghan March keeps Rowan a snarky, witty, and stubborn woman throughout the story despite her affection for the two alpha males in her life. March has also created a great cast of characters to surround her leading woman and men with and hopefully their stories will be told as well.It's an interesting setting that this menage story takes place in, and I'm sure it's only going to be more intriguing as the US tries to regroup and seek help from those who can provide it. In a post-apocalyptic environment, rules and regulations are a thing of the past, so as word spreads about the ranch, Graham and is men are going to have to protect their group as well as their land, and itâ€™s not going to end well for some of them.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4.5 poison apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A4SWYPO5AS9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBGL76I#wasThisHelpful","R1A4SWYPO5AS9O","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hard Charger is a super quick read that illustrates Lia, the woman Rowan helped rescue in book 1,  having the strength and the confidence to slowly rebuild her life after she succumbed to the darkness of what happened to her.Liaâ€™s story begins about 9 months after she became a part of the Castle Creek Whitetail Ranch; sheâ€™s coming out of her shell more, but there are still things that trigger her memories and force her to draw inward again.But what Hard Charger also demonstrates is Liaâ€™s determination to move past what happened to her and feel alive and safe in the arms of the two men who had her back since the beginning - Cam and Travis.Cam and Travis are interesting heroes who remain a bit of a mystery even at the end of the text; readers donâ€™t learn much about them except for the fact that they both want to give Lia what she needs, and while I understand why the focus is on Liaâ€™s transformation, I had questions about the two men in her life that were left unanswered.Liaâ€™s need and love for two men does make sense to me because of what she experienced at the hand of a group of vile men, but Lia as well as Cam and Travis are new to a menage relationship, so I felt like there needed to be more insight into why they chose this journey.Regardless of my need for more information, I really enjoyed Hard Charger. I love the world that Meghan March has created due to the power grid failure and there are multiple ways this series can be extended, leading to more suspense, angst, and passion.One key idea that seems to be strewn throughout the Flash Bang series is that it may be unconventional but in the world that now exists on the outside, it's all about making oneself happy and not giving a damn who doesn't approve.A complimentary copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.4 poison apples","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3BP92PF3OER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FRIUWO#wasThisHelpful","R1G3BP92PF3OER","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a lot at stake for Gracie and Raide in Hard to Fight, and it's up to them to decide what they're willing to fight for and what they need to let go of in order to make things right.Bounty Hunter vs. Bail SkipperOperation Bring In RaidePlan A: SeducePlan B: ChallengePlan C: ???I absolutely adored Gracie and her bada** bounty hunting self. She's an amazing heroine who puts a lot of pressure on herself to be the best because she's working against a lot of people and gender prejudice to do the job she loves. She finally gets a chance to prove herself, so she knows she needs to up her game because bringing in someone as big as Raide is going to require finesse, but as readers witness in the first half of Hard to Fight, sheâ€™s having a hard time putting her plans in action, which is well played by Bella Jewel because Grace finds herself in a rather precarious position when it comes to Raide and her conflict is played out well by how unsuccessful she is with him.Raide is a bada** alpha male who's dodging the law while trying to exact his revenge. He's a complex man - he's way more than just another criminal Gracie has to bring in, and she realizes that early on and walks a fine line while trying to reel him in. I would have loved to get a bit of Raideâ€™s perspective throughout the story; itâ€™s not that Grace doesnâ€™t describe him in ways that readers will understand who he is, but thereâ€™s things below the surface of Raide that I wanted to understand from his viewpoint not just through Graceâ€™s eyes.Gracie is definitely a fighter, and Raide has proven his determination to seek justice, but there are some things that occur in Hard to Fight that regardless of how much they try to fight against them, they can't, which is a huge problem for them because it takes them off their game plan and forces them in directions that they werenâ€™t prepared to go, but it also allows them to experience life in ways they never thought they would with how drastically different Grace and Raideâ€™s lives were.Hard to Fight is a fantastic start to Bella Jewelâ€™s Alphaâ€™s Heart series. The cast of characters, both lead and secondary, are entertaining with their banter and chemistry and the plot line flows nicely with the various strains running together as the story gets closer to its ending.Bring on the next Alpha!A complimentary copy was provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.4.5 poison apples","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HYQMQ2RN4FW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VE4Y2BE#wasThisHelpful","R1HYQMQ2RN4FW3","A39YL17T9LO0SP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39YL17T9LO0SP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I finally got a chance to put this umbrella through its paces (not that I was looking forward to it). But I have to say, this umbrella held up wonderfully. And, seriously, there was some serious rain and wind going on. I had to hold the handle and the stem just to make sure it wouldn't fly away, but there was some strong winds blowing about. This umbrella went above and beyond what I expected!This umbrella gets four stars for one reason, the handle. As soon as I held it it just felt off to me. It has a limited space in its crook for holding but the handle itself is extremely wide, making holding it feel secure but my fingers were really bunched. I found them overlapping in the handles crook when I finally felt as if I had the most secure grip. It wasn't uncomfortable but I haven't held the umbrella up for more than a minute or so. What also works in the handle's favor is that the umbrella itself feels very light.Overall, this is a more than solid umbrella. I want an umbrella that feels like a workhorse but doesn't carry the weight of one. This ShedRain does feel light in the hand overall, but the handle adds a balance to it because it does have a bit of weight to it. I wish it was more ergonomic but that is just how it feels in my hand. The handle is bright red, I actually like this, making it easy to find in your bag/purse (medium/large in size). You get your standard sheath for it as well. And the opening/closing mechanism feels really strong and durable. Used it 25x in a row just to make sure ... I really shouldn't did that before I had this umbrella in the shower, could've spared my bathroom walls/floor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RV9MS2DHQ1R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBNL4EW#wasThisHelpful","R3RV9MS2DHQ1R5","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a gorgeous cast iron pan. The green is a muted hunter green with a lovely finish that can easily go from the stove to the table without any worry that your guests might be mortified. It is not a huge pan, I was able to fit three medium size swordfish steaks with enough wiggle room for each piece. What I do love about the pan is the weight. I've always loved that about cast iron, you're not going to get the pan shifting while flipping the food. It stays put. I also like the fact that it has two drip wells to run off the excess fat. My husband didn't want swordfish and I ended up grilling up a quick steak, just had to wipe the pan down with a tissue and grill away.I am trying to think of a complaint and can not come up with one. It comes in a lovely box that is so slick that I wouldn't even bother to wrap (has nothing to do with me being bad at that sorta thing, honestly ... nope, not bad at all). Also, inside the box is a little instruction pamphlet, giving cleaning instructions. I truly can't think of a single negative. The price might be a deterrent but cast iron can truly last a lifetime, making it more than worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16P3GQ9RE5HPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PP3JV8E#wasThisHelpful","R16P3GQ9RE5HPO","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These scissors are sharp. They are recommended for ages 6 + on the box but if your little kiddie is a runabout then I would wait a year or really supervise due to the fact that these have a pointed edge. Yep, and that edge is pretty sharp. I've used a pair for sewing and these scissors were able to worm their way into a leather corner and handle it pretty quickly. It made me leery about giving them to the little ones that are around the age the box recommends. In fact, I couldn't. I'm going to hold off. But, if you have a kid that's responsible, go for it. These scissors are extremely well built and have just the right weight to them so their little fingers won't cramp and get tired.

"Go into this knowing what you're getting, a nice looking bathroom set that is above average in quality, but not stellar. The colors on the show curtain pop, and are vibrant and printed pretty well. They aren't bleeding into each other. The hooks are decent, but so have  light cheap feel to them. Overall, the quality of the curtain is more than acceptable for a dorm room or even just a regular bathroom. The star for me is the mat. I know, weird. But it is really well made. Soft. And I've already washed it, a habit with anything new. And it didn't bleed or pill. What I really like about it is that is a hemmed edge and doesn't just use a marrow machine to do the job that can fray and cause the mat to look cheap and tacky, the little details matter. Now, is this really a 14 piece set? Technically, yes because they count the shower hooks as individual pieces. That's right. You're getting the shower hooks, mat, and curtain â€“ nothing else. And for the price, you're actually getting a pretty good bargain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OGIBESJQB1CK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGVAGQU#wasThisHelpful","R1OGIBESJQB1CK","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent coffee machine, if you're willing to make the trade-offs. I love the intent behind it. Having the ability to have an excellent cup of coffee using a tried and true measure, pour over, should produce awesome results â€“ and it does. But it comes with some serious complications. I don't drink coffee often, only on weekends. But when I do, I use the pour over method. Yes, it is tedious. Yes, it is time consuming. Yes, it gives you some dang delicious coffee if done correctly. The issue I have with Kitchenaid's model is that it just hovers below what it should be able to do. Getting the water into the reserve is my main issue, such a tiny slit of space for an action that you just want to be done away with quickly. It adds too much time to an already tedious process, this machine already calls for a longer brewing time (heats the water before brewing) based on method alone. But this can be seen as a negative or a positive. You're not heating and slowly pouring the water yourself. But for the wait time, you might as well be.The design of the machine is beautiful. It looks extremely 50s to me. But it also has a few nagging issues. I hate the handle. If you have a larger size hand be leery, your knuckles might touch the carafe when gripping. Also, the carafe itself can cause unwanted spillage. I pour my cups over the sink with the carafe's opening kissing my mug. The footprint is great. It is not a counter hog. But by no means is it a small machine. It is workable in an average size space. But getting to the buttons in a cramped space might be an issue.So, why four stars? As I stated before â€“ the coffee this machine produces is EXCELLENT. Rich, layered, HOT ... I can't get enough of it. It seriously is making me reconsider making coffee part of my morning routine instead of a weekend treat. Just know, you're here for the excellent taste this machine produces â€“ not how quickly it'll make it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S17MZYGOBRR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQJ7X8S#wasThisHelpful","R2S17MZYGOBRR5","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It causes one to constantly make subtle shift of the headphones on your ears to get them just right. Thankfully, these headphones are light and you won't really mind, but it can become nagging. I wish this wasn't so because these Creative Sound's are near flawless when it comes to sound quality! They could stand toe-toe with headphones that are triple the  price. The soundstage on these are so open that the music just breathes and doesn't tire you out. You get a wonderful mid-range and the clarity is nearly bell like. I can't say enough good things about the sound quality. They just don't sound great for a pair of bluetooth headphones â€“ they sound great for any pair of headphones. Also, they do more than an adequate job when blocking out noise, you don't have to worry about winding the volume up with just the slightest noise, the isolation works here.

But I was more than happy to give this GE one a try. It is great. There is no grayish overcast, and it casts such a lovely almost gold like haze. I don't find the light too warm at all.

"Far Cry has always been a solid series. I worshipped 3. But Far Cry 4 just seems a little too over the top for me, just a little. But there is fun here, tons of it. Far Cry 4 is not even remotely trying to take itself seriously. The plot, if you can call it that, really doesn't matter. What does matter is that you're treated to an awesome bad guy that you don't see again for long stretches of time. But who really cares about any of that - the weapons are awesome, you get to ride an elephant and - um, you get to ride an elephant! Nothing beats slinging around a few baddies by the will of a trunk! It has to go down as one of the best gaming moments that I've had of this year, coming pretty dang close to playing GTA 5 in first person for the first time.Is Far Cry 4 perfect? Nope. It is buggy as all get out. I found some random glitches here and there. But nothing that took away from my overall enjoyment of the game, from what I've finished. I'm pretty deep into it. Another thing, is the playing time, like most games these days, with not much luck, you can beat it in under 20 hours. And that includes if you're pretty dang sloppy with your gameplay.

"I love this liner. We had the old fashioned one in a kitchen cabinet ... well, up until a few weeks ago. It was pretty tattered and when I went to rip it up â€“ nightmare.

The color is beautiful, a nice neutral beige that does have a bit of pop to it. And even though it doesn't have adhesive, it doesn't shift when placed down. I'm a fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R150Z1OBOJWZ7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2IJM6A#wasThisHelpful","R150Z1OBOJWZ7Y","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy these bars. My wife isn't a fan, feeling the sugar content is too high. But I work out pretty regularly and for a very long duration and the sugar content is a nice balance for me. I do prefer them over most energy bars, I can actually pronounce most of the ingredients. As for the taste, not bad at all. It has kind of chewy cookie consistency with a nice tartness provided by the cranberries. You know something tastes great when you feel as if it's gone too soon. Well, they are pretty small in size. But they are a great energy boost. I wouldn't go as far as to say they would make a go-to meal replacement.

"I love these gloves. First, they are truly lightweight and thin. I have run in these gloves nearly every day this fall/winter and they have taken on the temperature like a champ. I wasn't too sure if they could handle it. I had a rather expensive pair last winter that just didn't cut it and I found myself running in a pair of backup fleece gloves that looked like oven mitts. They kept my hands warm but they were not ideal. These Salomon's are doing great. I've been running in about the low/mid 20s this week and they've kept my hands warm. Like any pair of gloves, stay out too long and you can feel a bit of the cold creep in. But I'm out for a run for over two hours and no problems. I've actually stopped to get coffee afterwards and folks have asked about them, and I have nothing but good things to say. I wouldn't wear these for long stretches of time. These aren't made for that purpose, long stretches of extreme weather. But these gloves, due to their sleekness, allow for mobility. They run true to size and seem to be snag resistant. If you're looking for a longer pair of gloves, you might want to look elsewhere. These stop a little bit beyond the wrist on me. But that might be OK if you're running jacket is longer in the sleeve.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R355VY9ABKALFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVXKF86#wasThisHelpful","R355VY9ABKALFQ","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need to carry a power brick. I am at work for over 12 hours and my phone (LG G3) just doesn't make it that long. I have an older one that well, might as well be a real brick. It is really on the thick and heavy side. This model kinda floored me. I was expecting to be really lightweight and small but it was truly unexpected, the footprint is just amazing. It can fit in the smallest pouch of my briefcase where I keep my phone with no issue, prior brick couldn't do that. The LG G3 already charges pretty quickly when plugged up to an adapter and I am happy that this gives the same results. Another thing i love is that the cord isn't long and fits snug into the brick. If you want to charge this through an outlet, you'll have to supply the needed adapter yourself. It only comes with a USB to charge this brick with a computer, but still I can not recommend this enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NQCXIT7DR0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRK8HJ8#wasThisHelpful","R23NQCXIT7DR0V","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a dang good dartboard. Right off the bat. I am really happy with the quality. My old model, one which was a gift, was OK. It was not up to snuff to the regular amount of abuse that it got and I wasn't really willing to buy a new one. Mainly, used for fun when family/friends come over, I couldn't justify the investment. But this Winmau board reminded me why i fell in love with the game in the first place. First off, I'm a light/mid thrower, I need a board that has a good stick to it and this more than fits the bill. After a hit, the board heels nicely, and you truly have to inspect it up close to find the points. I know this isn't going to last, but it is a testament to the build quality of Winmau. The cheaper the board, more visible the scars. Also, you get that nice soft thump that comes from a quality board, not that hard almost gunshot like one that comes from a cheap board. Note: you might want to invest in some quality darts to match. I will also like to point out how bright and bold the colors are. The red frickin' pops! And the black, nice and inky. I really have a love for this board.Great board, excellent quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REV5S8T3MHWV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC36V6Y#wasThisHelpful","REV5S8T3MHWV5","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gorgeous! I don't now how else to put it. These are great every day earrings when you want to just spice up your look. They are also so well made that you can easily dress them up with a few accessories, say a nice necklace. I have to admit, wasn't expecting much. But the cubic zirconia really plays with the light and catches the eye. A nice contrast to the black stones. The snap posts also don't feel cheap. I've purchased my share of shoddy jewelry, but the clasps that grab the posts on these hold nice and firm. I can't think of a single complaint with these earrings. I was so pleased with them, I put them on immediately and trucked it out on a few errands ... I have no shame.

"I thought my niece would love this (1 1/2 yrs). After all, she's kind of a human garbage disposal (runs in the family). I used two packets. One packet just isn't enough, cooked it in the microwave, stirred - and was shocked that she took one bite and refused the rest! I actually thought I may have done something wrong with the preparation and prepared it again the old fashioned way; nope, didn't like it. Then I decided to give it a taste ... there's no taste. You suffer with a dry consistency and non-existent flavor until you get a tiny, dried, sad little blueberry that truly doesn't have the flavorful snap of a fresh one ... I can see why she refused it. This gets one star for its easy preparation ... but the price, you would be better off buying any brand of oatmeal.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LP6OS8F8YMPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHK6F2W#wasThisHelpful","R1LP6OS8F8YMPC","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great set. The best thing about it â€“ it doesn't feel cheap! You're getting a good value for the dollar. Sure, you can buy separate pieces, but it truly is unnecessary. Together, this is a sleek and well made set. The standout for me is the carafe. It's simple, duh, as it should be, and kept a lovely bottle nicely chilled and pert. It feels good in the hand, as well, with a lovely balance around the neck. The aerator is great, too. It pushed out a nice, full flavor of the wine. Sure, it takes of bit of time for it to actually get through the aerator itself but it is worth it. The corkscrew functions as any other. My one complaint is that it is a little weak. By no means does it feel cheap, but it just doesn't feel as sturdy as higher models. But this corkscrew is not an embarrassment, doing the job adequately. The stoppers are standard, but aren't most?Again, this is a great set by Metrokane. It would make a lovely gift for others ... or for one's self.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PBMQO8HW6MP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXJI54S#wasThisHelpful","R3PBMQO8HW6MP1","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful kettle (never thought I would ever utter those words). The color is a bit of a brick red but it pops a bit more. It looks very 50's. But looks mean nothing if a product doesn't work. And I am more than happy to report that this works wonderfully. I love the handle. It's easy to hold and balanced, something very necessary when pouring out something extremely hot. It is a two quart kettle, meaning you can get about eight cups from each use. I tried this, and you can. I can't think of a single issue. I do hope that it holds up against rust. Most tea kettles just don't. But this one seems pretty well made.

"Well, these taste pretty horrible. They have a sort of granular texture and once they get going it turns into a sort of doughy consistency until you swallow. Not really a fan. I really can't see the target market for this product. It has way too much sugar (12g) for children or people dealing with say diabetes, so I'm not sure what's the point. I can't even throw into the occasional treat category because of the mouthfeel. I haven't even gotten into the flavor â€“â€“ there nearly isn't any. I sort of get a hint of blueberry but nothing else comes through, not the raisins or the white chocolate that's listed on the list of ingredients.

"Yeah, I don't really see the point of this. The sugar content creeps up a bit too high and there isn't enough product in this package to warrant buying it. If you want to spice up your salad, you'd be better off buying nuts and berries separately and throwing them in. Also, I'm not really feeling the texture of these. They are a bit unforgiving to chew. I placed a bit in my salad and they have a bit of a hard consistency. I'm used to eating walnuts, raisins, etc in a salad but these are just way too noticeable - and sweet!

"Amazing. I love this band. First: really well made. It doesn't feel cheap at all. And because it is so thick, I can get a really good grip on it and maneuver it in ways that I am more than comfortable with. I can go full extension on my legs (something I really don't do. I like a bend in the knee) and get a good burn. The band feels really strong and supportive. You can play with finger placement to adjust the intensity which is nice. If you want to really concentrate on key areas. Holding the bend at an angle and just working my wrist gives my forearms a really nice workout.I don't mind the lint and dirt that some have had a problem with. Honestly, I'm glad that this is cleanable. This comes really close to my face for some exercises and above my head. I think it's pretty solid that I can run this puppy underwater/soap and get it clean for use.This is a solid buy. And you can comb the net for exercises if you wish to help you develop.

"This is a really good kit! Seriously. I have a way more expensive set that claims its worth is in the dollar value â€“â€“ this kicks that set's butt! Can't say this often but â€“â€“ what a bargain! What I like most about this set is that it just seems way more comfortable to use. The handgrips just feel a lot more comfortable to hold, letting you concentrate more on the exercise and form instead of on how comfortable or how well you have a grip on the handles. Also, with your trust in the handle, you get over the apprehension of band-snapping (not gonna happen) and you losing an eye ... yeah, I'm a chicken.It comes with a link to get some moves off their website, but you can also do your own video searching for that and come up with some awesome results. Oh, how I wish I didn't own that other set. Bands just work for me because I can get a great extension out of them after doing some serious cardio and not have to worry about the heaviness of weights, more a mental issue.

"This is an excellent sewing machine for beginners. The reason I say this is because of the foot pedal. Usually, you don't get much resistance with a higher model, say a more expensive model from Bernina, but with the Brother there is more than enough tension that you feel as if you're in more control of the needle. I do love that about this machine, but if you have been sewing for many years, you might find this annoying and time consuming.The XR3774 is an extremely well crafted machine. It's pretty lightweight, under 15 pounds. And doesn't suffer from poor build quality. This machine also has beautiful stitch quality. I know, I know, I should've mentioned stitch quality sooner. The XR3774 excels in this area. It covers 37 different stitches. I have not tried them all, and honestly neither will the most advanced sewer just looking to make garments. But if you want to dip into more decorative stitching, such as for quilting, you have some great options here. I have tried the most commonly used from straight to zig-zag and they are just perfect without the need to constantly readjust tension. Nothing is more annoying than having to adjust tension when switching between fabrics on the same garment. The XR3774 handled moving from cotton to satin on a zig-zag stitch without an issue. I am especially pleased with this due to the fact that I was using a pretty worn needle (I'm not ashamed of that) and there was no snagging. The hitting that the machine provided is pretty dang good!The LED is great. I was able to sew in dim light and get a really good view of the nooks of a hidden zipper. Also, the bobbin didn't jam, happens often with cheaper models.Again, if you're buying your first sewing machine, I highly recommended this model. Heck, even if you're looking for a steady work horse, this is a solid choice. I wasn't too familiar with Brother in this category. I have been a Singer/Bernina girl for ages. But this machine has opened my eyes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVKLKA47A1YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNS60AQ#wasThisHelpful","R3AVKLKA47A1YM","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge fan of KitchenAid's cookware. I've used different versions of their non-stick pans for many years. One thing I dislike about them â€“â€“ and to no fault of KitchenAid â€“- is that they don't have a terribly long shelf life. Some of my pots and pants, especially my cast irons, have been going strong for many generations. What makes KitchenAid a dang good cookware set is that you truly do get cookware that heats EVENLY! That is the number one thing I look for. It can make and break so many dishes from frittatas (first thing I made in the pan, turned out wonderful and slipped right out onto the plate) to french toast.Another great advantage to this set is the weight. These are not light pans. You don't have to worry about them shifting about the burner, helping in your food to cook evenly or not to have yolk go to heck on you and break. Something that I'm not really fond of are the handles. They are sturdy and are set really well, but they can get rather hot. I've had other sets from KitchenAid where this isn't much of a problem. But this set causes a bit of a mental error, tricking my mind into thinking if you've used one KitchenAid handle you've used them all â€“â€“ not the case.If you're not very familiar with anodized sets, just do yourself a favor and pick up a set of silicone utensils to use with it. You don't want to cause any sort of scratches on it. If you do, with time, you'll see more than your share of rust that'll gross you out as it pushes its way through the scratches you've caused. I wouldn't recommend using wood utensils either, I've learned from experience that they can do just as much damage as metal.This is a great set of cookware. It'll do well for a single person to a medium to large family. The pans are deep enough that you can get some truly great thick sauces going without the risk of heavy splatter. And the seal on the lids are tight enough that rust, again that dreaded word, won't make a speedy appearance, if at all. You'll do right by this, if you're in the market for great cookware.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBX19UEXVMK3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJAC8A0#wasThisHelpful","RBX19UEXVMK3G","A1DTCJV6KOMJOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I run through storage baskets pretty quickly. Usually, I buy wood ones. And someone will open something, say a lotion, without putting the top back on and it will leak onto the wood, causing it to eventually seep through and ... we all know the rest. I was really looking forward to these baskets for one main reason -- I could wash them! But I was a bit disappointed. They aren't sturdy. They came foldable and without anything to give them a solid base. Standing them up doesn't offer enough support and they sort of droop ... well, they droop. I don't know how long these will last or be able to even resemble storage baskets after repeated washings (that has me a bit worried).

"It looks great in photos, but right out of the box â€“ no, even in the box the weight tipped me off this was not really what I expected- barely 7 ounces. For anything other than a sub-$40 unit Iâ€™d expect a little heft. Actually, right in that price range at full retailâ€“ even less here- you can find what looks to be an equal if not superior Delta model. Looking at it I could see why I found the spray pattern selector tab of the Moen is difficult to operate, itâ€™s oriented in a way that makes it pretty much require both hands, while on the Delta itâ€™s located right where you can easily support the back with your fingers and flip the lever with a thumb. The Moenâ€™s is located perpendicular to the radius and moving it only tries mo rotate the entire assembly..Maybe itâ€™s not even a reflection of itâ€™s construction or performance, but I was disappointed never the less. The description says ""metal"" but not ""all metal construction"" so I assume they are referring only to the attachment fitting, or possibly the plating, which is certainly a good thick deposit, but would only technically considered ""metal"". But in the end, I couldn't resist, took a needle file to the upper side and scraped my way down to what definitely seems to be plastic.When I installed it, I found the ½â€œ pipe end is neither knurled for good hand tightening and presents only a 3/16"" wide flat surface for a 7/8"" wrench; (good luck with that) thereby leaving you only the choice of pliers or a pipe wrench to tighten- neither a very professional method. I suspect it might also be the only part of the head made of metal.  When I replace it I will perform an autopsy and provide and updateAnd once secure to the shower arm, the head barely can hold itself up- even tightening the nut further is clearly not a solution, not only is it not possible without damaging the surface (or worse) but the design is not a typical ball-and-socket or collet, where the movement tightens up as you snug it down.This continues to be a problem when flipping through the headâ€™s 4 settings, it is clearly a two-handed operation- while not uncommon and found in many other I have used, itâ€™s not because the mechanism is tight and secure, in fact it rotates quite easily and snaps clearly into a detent- for now- but the head is just so loose it wiggles around too much. I developed a method to hold the head in my palm and flick the lever with a finger, but itâ€˜s awkward and sort of uncomfortable, especially if you have grip issues.The settings are:  a small inner circle of 4 coarse jets from the center; a wide spray using most of the outer ring, a combo that uses the first two settings, and finally a second set of nozzles that put out a wan massage. I am reasonable certain it's a turbo-thing, you can hear it whirring even in the video (as soon as Amazon decides to attach it here). Now it is true I operate at 40 PSI, I donâ€™t doubt the overall effect would be improved by another twenty pounds of pressure, but I have tested many heads that deliver a lot more punch with the same flow. Including my most recent unit, which may be returned to service if the frustrations of the Moen continue to get to me. Oh, and it's even harder to adjust and aim with soap-slippery hands.The outlets are rubber tipped for easy cleaning, but they are also flush with the face of the head, not the type that protrude, so it appears it would be only to slow erosion of the plastic nozzles and perhaps resist hard water mineral growth a bit more successfully than plated plastic. To be honest, the water here is so alkali I have seen no plumbing fixture claiming to â€œresist hard waterâ€ to be any more effective than one that does not.I'd say the chrome unit is right on the edge of being overpriced, the ""nickel"" and ""oil-rubbed bronze"" are well into it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YH0GGCMA4L4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDVZJEK#wasThisHelpful","R1YH0GGCMA4L4V","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although my days of air travel are mostly behind me, I still put a lot of miles on the road in a small pickup, where cabin space is probably equal to carry-on. I have never considered top-end luggage, but now I can see why itâ€™s more like buying a home than a bag- Tumi continues to uphold itâ€™s reputation with a bag such as this.I am only familiar with the typical, simple garment bags like I have seen through the years carrying slung over a shoulder,  I never had enough need to bother with the extra burden but the Tumi was a revelation. It must be part black hole, it seems to hold everything I can throw into it. I rarely need more than 2 sets of â€œniceâ€ clothes on the road, now it is so much easier to stow them in one of the compartments and still have the rest of the bays for my usual, three pairs of work clothes.It is an amazingly well designed and constructed bag, well beyond the reach of any other garment bag I've ever seen or used. â€œBallisitic Nylonâ€ not merely because of the material, but the construction is bulletproof (no, not literally) and I found virtually no flaws in function or form. Well, the zipper that closed the shirt-tail flap was a little tricky, but you could get used to it. The entire liner appears to zip open for maintenance, but like they also say, â€œno user serviceable parts insideâ€ so the pulls are well hidden. The rest of the zippers are so well laid out that they are not really under a lot of stress when operated, even though they are high quality and well built, a design that puts less strain on the whole track usually means a much longer and trouble free life.The side-edge pull handle telescopes in 4 sections down to almost nothing, but is quite solid and when collapsed tucks into a zippered compartment. I found the different center of gravity  a little odd after years of the usual drag-along two wheeled sort, but I got used to it quickly and find a 4 wheel system is a whole lot easier to manage, especially parking it somewhere4 side pockets cover the outside flap,  they zip only along the top and side edges- this probably to prevent overstuffing. The lower pair only have a top zip. The flap itself opens and pulls outward with a divides compartment, might be good for a book or magazine, a tablet maybe.The bag secures well when closed with nylon snap buckles, and it is scarcely different in appearance from a normal suitcase. There are 2 removable zippered clear bags that nestle in the top corners of  one half for toiletries or gadgets, although itâ€™s usually tough to squeeze my old kit in anywhere, downsizing and switching over to the Tumi might make things a lot simpler. Unfortunately, while they snap out easily enough, reinstalling them is difficult, there are only 2 small snaps to secure each one on each side.  I donâ€™t know if an easier arrangement could be imagined, but since they canâ€™t really be accessed while the bag is hanging, Iâ€™d plan on a few extra minutes to pack if you remove them.Comes without any sort of proprietary hangars, (with space for at least 4 tube hangers) and a clever snap lock, plus the requisite chain and hook for your destination.Ad copy says 4 wheels are recessed, but not fully and dangle a bit whilst carrying or stowing. Still, the casters themselves are stout and durable, with double tires and a solid axle- nice to see, I have had blowouts on at least 2 of the bags I have used.While described as a â€œgarment bagâ€, itâ€™s a long way from that that appellation suggests- a big, floppy plastic thing my uncle used to use to carry his suits, difficult to manage and more at home just hanging up as a protective bag.Not so the Tumi, which is road-ready and accepts your formal or business wear as designed, stores and retrieves without a wrinkle. ). If you are thinking about upgrading to a high quality carry-on garment bag, look no further.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HJPQJRRSLT1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQBU4WQ#wasThisHelpful","R1HJPQJRRSLT1E","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Installed an Orbit timer Orbit 62040 2-Dial Digital Hose Faucet Watering Timer which has a quick acting valve and the 40 year old 20 foot 3/4"" copper supply line nearly slapped the bottom of the house first time it closed. It obviously bothered the customer, and could lead to damage on older joints, so I cut in and added a reducing tee, then the arrester. Took about 10 minutes. I should have but did not wrap the device with a heat sink, just soldered it in with minimum heat. The results were immediate and exactly what was expected; no banging at all. If you have trouble with precise heat control in your pipefitting, get one of these Sioux Chief Mfg 660-2 1/2-Inch MIP Thread Mini Rester Residential Water Hammer Arrester use threaded fittings where you can and simply screw the thing in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UYLRKMNMUA74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JSRDOY#wasThisHelpful","R1UYLRKMNMUA74","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this model as a simple solution to ease in the crossfade between a 40 year old conventional home sprinkler system and a contemporary drip. Not wanting to put all the eggs in one basket I began in phases and chose this timer as it seemed simple and reliable. It also needed to be light enough to not cause concern about excessive weight on what could be a wide variety of less than ideal hose installations, some I have seen extend a length of Â½â€ copper way too far, hanging a device at the end of it and then a hose would be unwise in these situations. But the Orbit offers a relatively compact interruption.And so far it has proven to be so. Installation is obviously about as simple as it gets, just disconnect your hose-threaded supply end and screw the Orbit in between. I was wondering about how the angle of the typical hose bib would be for presentation of the control, but it seems acceptable. I have read in other reviews (among other issues I have not encountered) that this model does not work in the horizontal position, but I would speculate most customers will use it as intended.After running the new soakers and emitters I programmed the unit and began tests. Here I discovered a minor flaw, if you care to call it that, being the most simple clock chipsets you could imagine. Very retro, both the time of day and runtime setups are forward only, hold the button for two speeds- sort of fast and then usually too slow. And then you miss the moment and have to spin again. I got the hang of it after a few tries, it just took practice. Explains the lower price than some of the more complex units I evaluated.Putting it into use could not be simpler, once the time of day (not the date) is set, just pick a start time and thatâ€™s it for the digital. From then on two rotary dials let you choose run time (5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes) and frequency (Daily, 2nd Day, 3rd day, up to weekly) and thatâ€™s it. Snap on the (hopefully) waterproof clock cover and off you got.Alterations on the fly are easy enough, but try to get your start time right the first time, itâ€™s just a bother compared to more contemporary clocks- even ones with a simple â€œbackâ€ arrow)In operation it snaps on and you know itâ€™s on. At the designated off time it also snaps shut, sincerely, so much so that in 2 out of three installations I had to install a water hammer arrester, the shock to one rather shaky Â¾â€ 20 foot copper run was alarming, to say the least. But after I put this in Sioux Chief Mfg 660-S 1/2-Inch Male Sweat Mini Rester Residential Water Hammer Arrester it was barely detectable. Just a snap and the hiss off water in the pipes.Sioux Chief also make a model designed for washing machines, Sioux Chief Mfg 660-H 3/4-Inch Female Swivel Hose Thread by 3/4-Inch Male Hose Thread Mini Rester which involves no soldering, and oddly enough itâ€™s the same cost or cheaper than the solder-in type I used. You'd have to contend with some radical angle changes normally used in a washer setup, but it might be a lot easier for most users to install.So far after 3 stations running for 2 months I have encountered no problems at all. Assuming it ever rains this year in CA, I will probably shut them down and pull in for the season, I donâ€™t see any compelling reason to leave them exposed, and the waterproof cap is not altogether convincingly secure. But Iâ€™d give it a try without fear, they are well designed in most other aspects so why not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FFZRHI43B47G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YDUDKK#wasThisHelpful","R2FFZRHI43B47G","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:12 Mins Without getting into another long-winded recollection about how far storage has come since my first computer, with perspective or not, the Samsung  is still the smallest and fastest and relatively capacious memory device I have ever used. And itâ€™s cheap. And Samsung.(OK, it's 400 times capacity of my first hard drive, and the size v. cost.. never mind)I canâ€™t have long dongles on the laptop, this one is about the size of the Logitech receivers with a protrusion thatâ€™s safe from accidental abuse and nearly undetectable, yet easier to hook with a fingernail and slide out. Itâ€™s also white, making it somewhat more easier to spot, at least on my laptop..I rarely use my old 4â€ long ones, I never went larger than an 8G, simply because for large files itâ€™s easier to plug in a Passport or other small portable HDD.But this Samsung makes it incredibly easy to have semi-permanent place to store files awaiting transfer and just about the right capacity for the information I collect on my weekly business trips. Itâ€™s so easy to just leave it in and then transfer to the base to bring the files home.About the only drawback I see is also its biggest plus: the size. If no other piece of hardware you own demands a decent, dedicated travel bag itâ€™s this one, at less than 1/4 the size of the smallest I have used and would be easy to lose in places you didnâ€™t even know you had.If no advanced use problems pop up, I see no reason not to get a few more of these, even the 64G size is a bargain (but really $2.00 more- is it that much slower?) , and properly cared for they are an ideal solution for a problem that has always been with us- a place for my stuff.â€œSamsung 5-Proof Technology makes the flash drive waterproof, shockproof, temperature-proof, magnetic-proof, and X-ray-proof, so you can bring it everywhere with the confidence your data will be safe.â€","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CD83RBSY282Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CCTOC2#wasThisHelpful","R1CD83RBSY282Y","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never get tired of Son Volt- Jay Farrar and any of his incarnations. Unique in a way of presentation and songwriting, he offers music nearly too challenging to be considered mere entertainment, but history, philosophy, or just deeply cutting observations. Even though at times his voice can strike me as monotonous, nasal and vaguely irritating, it never bothers me and what he has to say is so important and so well executed it rises beyond any issues I may have with his music. And in fact. I have none, a;though even now I am having a hard time keeping some of these tunes out of my mind as I try to write. And not just earworms, his songs intellect-rousing  works of art.

"Ask anyone about my fashion sense and they will tell you I was born without one. Take away the Tumi logo (and the manufacturerâ€™s $225 suggested retail price tag) and ask me to evaluate this bag- Iâ€™d say it was just another small nylon backpack, although made with a  smoother than casual black nylon, somewhat ostentatious gold zippers and D-rings, and somewhat above-average constructionIâ€™d guess it would be in the same category as a lovely SF Giants backpack I just bought at a sports shop for about $30.00. Strip the orange, put the Tumi badge on and tell me what itâ€™s worth and Iâ€™d have to pause and think for a moment about fashion.But this is not an essay on that matter, or thoughts on how Tumisâ€™s more significant items of luggage reflect a higher standard- just a comment or two on what is actually a quite lovely little bag, a purse in schoolboyâ€™s clothing. And  somehow itâ€™s feminine enough not to make it into the Murse category; I am pretty sure not too many men I know would find it so.It has a reasonably capacious main cargo compartment for the big things, and a pouch in front that should hold most of your I need it now stuff, we find an outside slip-in pocket at the top thatâ€™s perfect for a phone, right behind it on the inside you find a another one backed up to it, but itâ€™s a lot larger and could hold a small tablet or paperback. Inside the main compartment on the innermost side thereâ€™s another zippered slot thatâ€™s almost hidden (except for another Tumi tag) might be good for flat things, paperwork, cash, a travel pamphlet... or just somewhere to hide things and then forget where you put them.I rather suspect this fine item would ever be filled to capacity and ever worn as a backpack, even though itâ€™s design suggests it could, the single sling would make that unlikely, but it is light, solid and attractive enough to serve in any way the design and your preferences dictate. The nylon material used throughout seems not quite delicate, but has a fine grained appearance that suggests it would show marks and scuffing too well, not a durable ripstop doorstop, but then itâ€™s not trying to, either.A weighty, gold, Tumi (and only Tumi) nametag sheathed in leather hangs prominently from the top of the bag, just because, you know, Tumi.

"I have found external batteries to be a lifesaver, especially in the case of using a dead old iPhone (for entertainment purposes only) with a more or less completely dead battery- it is on life support but still useable.I rely on 2 others I have been testing, which both are rated over 4000 mAha, they are both flat and relatively bulky. Both are rectangular, which is fine for slipping into a pants pocket but ungainly if you are one-handing it.Now we come to the HP, which seems tailor made for single-handed survival options rather than emergency on the go recharging. I didnâ€™t think having a battery in a cylinder would be that big of a deal, but it is- itâ€™s hugely more comfortable to carry, a lot more manageable with one hand, and certainly not as dorky looking as carrying a large, flat heavy thing. Large, flat heavy devices are bad enough, so I would have to say any doubts Iâ€™d have had about the shape making a difference are resolved (although it more closely resembles a concrete vibrator, if you have ever had the opportunity to see one of those at work.) I am not enamored by the color, the dull silver finish is enlivened by the resolute â€œHPâ€ logo but the appearance doesnâ€™t seem to be a negotiable point with this unit. It is actually a flattened cylinder to prevent it from rolling away. Both input and output ports are at the same end, allowing it to stand on its own although this one is so light it doesn't seem all that stable, even though the included foot-long cable would allow it to be used this way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXY7FNBVJUV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8JGSMO#wasThisHelpful","RTXY7FNBVJUV4","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The door-mounted broom holder is great, I have used variants but this one is a snap to mount and gives a decent grip, although it seems to not take too well to really skinny handles utensils. It''s a less expensive variant than some I have seen, but the principle is the same, a cam-lock ball traps a broom handle in a slot. Skinnier handled tools are not held quite as snugly, but so far I have not found this to be a major problem. Smaller plastic hooks sprout off the end of each cleat, which is extremely handy for hanging those last minute things that just don't seem to have a permanent place to live.- - - - - - -The bag dispenser is a great breakthrough for those who can't quite get it together enough to save all their old produce and meat bags to haul to recycling, but can't bear to part with them either. I am one of those types, and find it a major relief to now have a spot those pesky bags can call their own. This is a clever solution, shove the bags into the slot at the top and somehow, you'll always be able to peel on out of the ""mouth"" at the bottom and find it in great shape and ready to go. It comes in two pieces, the backing plate (I mounted mine inside a cabinet door) and the ovoid dispenser which is supposed to snap over the base when it's in place.Unfortunately, the base plate as I received it was rather warped and wavy, and since it's a fairly stout plastic there was no way to get it attached to the surface and have it lie flat enough to then let the dispenser snap into place. Simplest answer was to rip a small piece of 1/4"" plywood to jut over the outside dimensions, and then using an air stapler attach the base around the outside edge with a few in the middle for added security. I then screwed the wood to the door, slipped the plastic dispenser over and locked it in place, and filled it with bags. It has been happily dispensing them ever since.Both very handy products to utilize underutilized areas of your kitchen and pantry.These products were provided in exchange for the words of comment you have just read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IJT14RDYV60N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKPIMGE#wasThisHelpful","R1IJT14RDYV60N","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It would not expect you to believe me if I said there is absolutely nothing I donâ€™t like about this unit, so weâ€™ll get that out of the way first: the color. The canister head is a distinctive orange-bronze while the motor section is a fairly sincere deep shade of brown, We donâ€™t buy vacuums for their color combos.. or do we? Better than Day-Glo green certainly, but even matching the top to the motor could have been a better choice. Everything else- yes. From the quality of materials to the clean design to the ease of use- a winner. It was easy to assemble, I had it together in seconds without any assistance from the instructions- and only a glance at the box for the only even slightly tricky part- the accessory tool holder- It attaches to the handle, and could possibly be installed inverted, but youâ€™d notice it works a lot better positioned so the tools point upward. And I have never seen a simpler or more effective onboard storage scheme.(I would suggest a reading of the manual in any case, there is a surprise or two, as well as, for me at least, a lesson in the correct terminology of bagless vacuums.)All of the other snap together pieces are so simple, they may be assembled clearly either one way only, any way, or just as happy in a 180Â° out orientation. All fit together without the slightest hint of anything but a good, tight and trouble free connection, the one that will stand years of abuse, imagine what life youâ€™d get with good care.On the job- oh, that-  it's not as kick-ass as some of the way more beefy units I have tried, obviously without a dedicated power rug extractor it can't deep clean carpets as well as some. I found for most purposes it was more than enough, and certainly so on hard surfaces- especially hard to get at hard surfaces the power is more than adequate. I rarely encountered anything the Bissell could not handle. It is not loud or intimidating enough to scare a sleeping cat, but the power is there (If you doubt it, judge the sound of the motor with the canister removed) and given its dexterity and solid construction I do not think I would see it as a huge compromise.Accessories there are few, it is unpretentious that way, rather than a panoply of stuff to lose if comes with the basics: a small brush, a crevasse tool, a â€œuniversalâ€ floor head and a hard-floor only head. The former is smooth surfaced for gliding over carpets, and has no beaters. I can live without that, the air driven type are almost always useless, and running power through the hose it always a weak point.The hardwood head does have vacuum (â€œturbineâ€)-powered brush, and on a smooth floor it works quite well. A release plate that you can operate with a thumbnail allows for quick field removal of the roller should you ingest and jam a large objectA small bypass valve in the top of the canister will pop open if the main filter clogs, it makes a fairly unique sound and I would suggest that if you hear it stopping immediately before something makes it into the motor inlet filter.Thereâ€™s only has one way to store the wand, and thatâ€™s only with one of the floor attachment on, it clips onto a small hook at the lowest part of the canister handle. Itâ€™s not the most secure arrangement, and  would not suggest trying to maneuver the unit around this way, but itâ€™s a convenient place to park the hose while working.The hose and attach points are strong and solid, apparently built knowing they will spend most of their time taking most of the punishment as you drag it around the house. And without a complaint. The large rear wheels means itâ€™ll pretty much roll over anything, including its power cordI would say it doesnâ€™t seem too happy to be upended and isnâ€™t too stable that way, but once the chamber begins to load the extra weight lowers the CG a little and it seems more balanced.The body of the machine is as simple and refined as you can get: All solid and built for rugged use:  a housing for the motor and fan, wheels, the cord and 2 switches- power and the cord retract mechanism. A large light illuminates when suction drops below the pre-set level, and should probably be regarded with respect..The business end is simply a 5 foot hose, no stretch but very well built and swivels well. Unlike an upright, you control the whole proposition wit authority choosing either hose or sweeper, changing on the fly is literally a snap. The connectors, as I have said, are easy to use and stout as well. Plug one end into the motor, attach the 45Â° hand piece/extension /hose holder and youâ€™re almost ready to go. An extension wand, nicely finished in brushed stainless, extends and retracts smoothly by releasing a barrel in the middle, the length goes from 22â€ to 34â€. The wand extension release barrel may also be slid slightly upwards to break the vacuum briefly in case you suck up a string rug or small animal, a feature common on most older vacuums but one I havenâ€™t noticed in awhileChoose a floor head or the brush or crevasse tool and thatâ€™s it. I would like to have seen either of the two smaller tools plug directly into the end of the hose to more easily get into tight places, but I donâ€™t think finding a small barrel to make an adapter would be a big chore.The clear plastic vacuum chamber â€“ AKA â€œdirt cupâ€ cradles perfectly in the motor housing, and is literally a snap to remove and service- a thumb catch at the top of the canister and you can pull the assembly free, which another thumb catch opens the hinged bottom side and releases the debris into your place of choice (The instructions also make the comment that â€œallergy sufferersâ€ may wish to do this with the canister inside of a plastic bag- how thoughtful)Further cleaning  necessitates a twist of the handle which separates the clear plastic dirt cup housing  for a more thorough washdown. And this too can be further broken down with another twist which frees the â€œcyclone shroudâ€ from the main cyclone assembly. Pay attention, it will only go on one way, and the alignment arrows are small and a bit difficult to spot. (Practice while itâ€™s clean. I put a small alignment dot on both parts to speed reassembly until it becomes second nature.Filters are essential to the long life of a vacuum, and the Bissel is proof- in addition to the cyclone chamber, its carry handle is also the release catch to pop up the lid and give access to the â€œdirt cup filterâ€- I would say it is in fact the canister exhaust filter, a five inch ring of padded gauzy material which is the last stop before the actual motor pre-filter, that being a 1.5â€ X 3â€ ovoid piece of coarse ScotchBrite-like  material, clearly the last stop before the fan. Both may (and should) be regularly removed and cleaned by blowing off and washing.Further, in a masterful stroke of design, the motor exhaust filter (â€œpost-motor filterâ€) lives inside of the left wheel and is a 5â€ x 1â€ pleated paper affair in a green plastic housing which releases with an 1/6th turn. This is also key to not only motor happiness, but air quality- and nothing is skimpy about this unit. RTFM-  I might never have known of its existence of not for a study of the book. (câ€™mon, itâ€™s only 5 succinct pages long.)Details like this elevate a machine beyond my taste regarding whatever color someone thought was attractive into the range of high quality industrial design.If you really feel the need, the fifteen-tube pickup assembly can also be separated from the heat with 4 snap tabs, but barring a major failure, I canâ€™t imagine why anyone would want to do this, and do not recommend it unless necessary, the tabs are not intended for a lot of use. I find that when a machine can be broken down this far you have the capability to really keep it clean, and that is the key to a long and healthy vacuum cleaner life.TL/DR, I know, but I like this machine. I have always been impressed by Bissell, after a little Butler model hung in (and still hangs in) 15 years after being purchased solely as a woodstove vacuum, I remain impressed by the quality I found in this model. A lot, and thought you might enjoy hearing why.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O0V2JAYO2ID1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OORUCW#wasThisHelpful","R2O0V2JAYO2ID1","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great book if you are more into keeping notes about your days than just planning them. An 8.5X11â€ format gives you three days per page, and more than enough room for filling in the details. Itâ€™s not broken out by hour, so more than a scheduler, it seems better suited as a journal, I have used many such as this in the past. A 2 page monthly calendar divides the 4 weeks, with plenty of room for more truly â€œat-a-glanceâ€ planning.But essentially it's just a demarcated spiral notebook, while this design allows for easier writing, but it does not seem to have as much strength as others in the more upscale At-A-Glance product line, the front and rear boards are not that much heavier than said spiral notebook, in fact merely from shipping one corner has already endured some bending.

"If you are looking for an easy to use w-fi repeater, this is about as simple as it gets- plug it in, turn it on, clone via WPS buttons and youâ€™ve got another 75-100â€™ of range. The Aukey does not stop there, however, and also can be configured as a WAP and may be configured in a variety of was. All are simple, work as advertised. I found the somewhat small instruction manual to be easy to follow and all I needed to get going.I have been trying various extenders/repeaters for a while, and many of them, like this one, were provided by the manufacturer in exchange for evaluation and review. But unlike several of the others I have tried, this is one I would recommend to any user.While it is capable of all the usual tasks required of a device like this, I found the simple chore of extending your range should be just that-= a simple chore.Itâ€™s a nice clean design, wall hugging and not too wide. The US power adapter is a snug fir too, suggesting others are available from Aukey as well. Controls and ports on the bottom edge could not be simpler or easier to hit. A surprise and somewhat unusual feature but one I appreciate a lot is the simple addition of a power switch, I am sure itâ€™s not that uncommon but being able to power off a wireless device without physically removing it or risking losing settings is a good thing.For my test I first cloned the MAC via WPS and then relocated to the furthest point from my router, which would be in the shop about 80 feet and several walls away. Using an old iPhone 5 (possessed of not the most powerful WiFi I have seen) using Radio Paradise I was able to get a decent signal as I walked nearly 100 feet in a direction that is not covered.. The Aukey held on even further, but once the signal dropped I could not reconnect, walking back uprange I found it again around 75 feet. This is true line of sight, as it says in the finely printed but easy to understand manual, â€œis mainly used for providing free wi-fi service in a big area such as a factory, community, street, and etc.â€. The book also wisely avoids speculating on range, as they say, YMMVThe device can also be accessed and set up via a browser or cable, and may be configured as a repeater or WAP. I have a perfect use for one of these at my moms, where I can use an existing 6 port switch and the Aukey to add wi-fi in a location far from the router, while I am sure the glut of these devices will grow, the ones that have such simplicity of use will always find my favor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1C62XXAYV0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PEXKJY#wasThisHelpful","R1A1C62XXAYV0E","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:41 MinsKitchen thermometers have never been a part of my basic cooking tools, I have always gotten by. But a device like this gives a lot more control over a kitchen situation, and I found it to be in a price range that would make it hard to resist, just through testing it out (for which it was provided to me in exchange for this review) I learned a great deal more about how it can let me be as busy as I want in the kitchen and still not forget about something in the oven. The temperature memory allows you to pre-set your desired temp, when reached the alarm sounds. You can scroll through them with the up/hr down/min buttons - there are 6 built-in default temps, each illustrated with a little icon of the animal you are preparing, in case you lost your FDA chart. Some overlap, but, whatever.Choices are - 185Â°  (chicken) 170Â° (pork and well-done beef) 160Â° (a ham, I am guessing, and beef medium) 145Â° (rare or fish). The mfr has included their own chart which gives different names to the icons, but the whole scheme is  probably OK for most uses, and certainly better than the kind I have been using- an analog dial probe.Should you desire to enter a custom temp, just select one of the presets and  dial it in with the up/down button. The range starts at 32Â° with the upper end at 482Â°, which is also listed as the max end for probe safety reasons.So if you are into candy making or (like me) dialing in a deep-fryer temp, you won't be left out. The alarm only works in the uphill direction, so if you want to use it for ice cream or testing HVAC stuff, sorry. This is undoubtedly why it is sold as a ""Food Thermometer"".During the test with my fryer, I just guessed the upper end and discovered one thing that might not be annoying to many- when the temp hits the setpoint and the alarm sounds, there is no way to quickly silence the alarm- you must either turn the unit off with the power switch on the back, pull the probe and wait, or in my case, dial the temp setting up further until it's off. I find this a bit inconvenient, but I would have to say my needs and testing methods usually exceed those of your average user. Not a deal-breaker, but it's a nice point to know. It also tracked the unit's temperature with enough accuracy to judge the cooking temp of the oil to monitor it or re-calibrate the controls. (The cycling shown in the video as the alarm sounds is unedtited.)Testing accuracy,  both 32Â° and 212Â° registered and held within a 2 degree range, which is better than one of my more elaborately calibrated but much older general purpose digital thermometers. I noticed ambient temps were often off by about 4-6 degrees, but since it was designed for accuracy at the higher end, I don't see this as an issue uncommon in lower end thermocouples.Not only is it a useful cooking thermometer, it also functions as a countdown timer which may be used in conjunction with the temp settings. It's pretty basic, but also not the main event here. It can be set to up to 24 hours, but only up- no backing out. Same with minutes, of course up to 60.Powered by a single AAA cell which is always a convenience, although mine was DOA.It's a nice little unit, not exactly overbuilt but looks like it will sustain some moderately  rough kitchen duty. A pair of magnets on the back is only too logical when placing the thermometer, but they are really weak and will barely let the unit hang onto a smooth steel oven door, although it seemed a lot better on a textured surface like my refrigerator. And making more challenging, the cable adds a little more weight and helps it destabilize. Easy enough to fix, but still..It also has a small fold-out plastic stand, but I found the nature of the probe cable makes it take a little bit of a balancing act to get set up just right. A piece of non-skid material along the bottom edge might help it stay in position better.The meter-long braided SS probe has a mini-plug connection and while a little stiff at first, still holding shape from being folded in the box, appears to be shaping up to be more flexible. But unless the probe is buried inches deep in a thick roast, a little care should be given to have it all balanced and safely positioned. The probe itself is bent at about a 20Â° angle, which I first thought was shipping damage, but a check of the item photo shows me all is well. This angle probably improves the placement of the tip, but I discovered it also tends to bake more firmly in place. Which in itself is not a bad thing, but it makes removal a two-hand task.A backlight would have been useful, but I found the lack of a way to quickly silence the alarm while on the fly quite annoying.It's not that hard for an experienced cook to get things done just by smell or feel, or in some cases just instinct, but when trying something new, or for the inexperienced, or for those wanting to adhere to strict safety rules, at this price point you can't beat the ThermPro.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6SN3IGEAEDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ADXZF6#wasThisHelpful","R3K6SN3IGEAEDY","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:50 Mins I love this thing. But as a flashlight enthusiast since 1967, it's hard not to be overawed by the selection and range of lights that are now available. It's a good thing I don't have a real job, or I'd spend all my disposable income on gadgets like the Sunree CC Rechargeable Camping Lantern.In fact it just came into service at a time when setting up an alternative would have been too time consuming. I was working in the alcove behind my refrigerator, all I had to do was drive in an oversized sheet metal screw and the magnet in the base took care of it- more than enough light for the job. It's not the largest or most powerful magnetic base I have ever seen, but if the surface you want to attach it to is flat enough it's perfectly adequate for the weight.The primary means of support is a pop-up plastic carabiner hinged to the base, you can clip it to just about anything with a loop in the end, or use the additional two provided carabiners to find even more attach points, it makes it easy to find a home wherever you areCompact and solid, it has a nice heft to it and appears quite well built, the charging ports are covered by a hinged plastic pop-out tab that looks a lot more long-lived than the usual rubber band.The light is powered by a hefty battery that can of course be used to charge just about any device you might have along on you camping trip, although a mini and a full sized USB poet out seem to be the norm these days for anything with adequate battery capacity, which is nice.The power switch is located on the backside, it would be considered the base if you used it on a table, but as this is clearly intended to be suspended, call it the top. Press it once and a row of blue LED's light up to show charge level, twice brings medium brightness, then again high, again for low. Seems an odd way to do it, but you get used to it. The penultimate button-push before ""off"" sets the light a-blinkng, which is primarily irritating, but could have some emergency location use for which I have not yet had a need. Unfortunate; it's an unhelpful and annoying feature for normal use.Charge time is quick, battery life on any setting is above average. I live in an area know for spotty electrical service, not only have I been a flashlight collector for years, now I have justification.I have not tested it for waterproof-ness, truth is I'd rather not find out the hard way that it was actually ""water-resistant"" than ""water-proof"". But it is well enough sealed that I believe it could take an accidental dunking and fare rather well.It's a great little package, we get the light itself, a very lightweight USB to mini charging cord, 2 extra carabiners and a little ""Ding-Dong"" Hostess Ding Dongs, 2 Cakes (Pack of 6) -like case to carry it all. Except- and to voice my only complaint, it doesn't. It's a tight fit with just the lamp, and just too small to get everything in. When I tried, the zipper got halfway round and broke. So, don't over pack and you'll be OK, but that reduces the handiness.This Sunree would be right at home anywhere, in addition to being at the ready in emergencies, I am already finding lots of uses in ordinary life, practically everything except camping, although when the power goes, it's not much different.(note: This product was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SDUEYY3G5JQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFMGBGG#wasThisHelpful","R1SDUEYY3G5JQI","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While they are packaged and sold as ""shipping labels"", these are actually the dream come true for lovers of all things Avery. Just an adhesive backed 8.5X11"" blank sheet that can be used for just about anything. In fact, the size is a lot larger than I would consider necessary for most of the things I have found myself shipping, but finally you can  make a label with no limit to the layout.I also gave DVD disk labels a try, it worked quite well- rather than dealing with a half-dozen templates for as many different brands of DVD specific labels available (Stomper, Memorex, Avery, generic, etc.) and never printing with anything approaching consistent accuracy of alignment, I found it to be a lot faster (and only requiring a reasonable amount of advanced motor skills)to simply print as many as will fit on a page and trim by hand. And, you can get at least 3 on a sheet instead of the usual wasteful die-cut 2.They cut easily and do not leave much of a residue on scissors, but I would suggest a razor knife or guillotine cutter- if you are reading this you probably have both. It was fairly simple to cut down to the backing, peel off the label as needed, and even re-use the sheet with just the remainder. My latest printer, the redoubtable Canon Maxify iB4020 Canon MAXIFY iB4020 Wireless Office Inkjet Printer with Mobile and Tablet Printing and Airprint and Google Print Compatible ,Black didn't have a problem with these no matter how many bald spots were left when I sent them through. Assuming they were relatively flat, of course.Avery watermarks on the full backside of the peel-off section is a really simple and highly visible solution to avoiding mis-loading these labels in your printer.The uses for a full sheet label are so many and so tempting it would be easy to blow through a box of 250 without restraint, irrespective of the intended use.

" 2:30 Mins Not to say it's to be considered avoidable, but for reasons described here and hopefully shown in the video, the Bora saw plate did not really live up to my expectations. After using my shop-built 8' shooting board for years and with no complaints, (other than the inherent unwieldiness of such a thing) I'd often wondered if one of the Kreg devices might be easier to manage. So, some me time ago I acquired a Kreg Rip Cut Kreg KMA2675 Kreg Rip-Cut and found yes indeed it was, but with the limitation of the saw being guided strictly by the edge of the workpiece rather than a true straightedge device.I then happened upon a Bora Edge Clamp 50"" Clamp Edge Saw Guide Bora 543050 WTX Clamp Edge. Locking Handle Heavy Gauge Saw Guide for Straight, Precise Cuts, and while it was relatively easy to use, it made sense only for quick and not necessarily dead on cuts, just a way to keep the saw relatively guided when accuracy wasn't too important. Calculating the offset as well as the tedious manner of accurately and squarely clamping the bar still remained a deterrent, as well as the unsuitability of the length for anything longer than ripping a sheet of 4 X 8 in half. Without the optional extension, obviously.So I thought the  Bora 542006 would be a good companion to the Edge Clamp despite its 50"" length (and my unwillingness to upgrade to an extension)I eventually got through the absurd clamshell package and evaluated the parts. In some cases, there is no need to even look at the instructions let alone be bothered by them enough to complain; you simply slide the hex head bolt into the only place it will go- a hex-shaped relief on the underside, and then stuff the spring and saw plate clip on the other side held in place by the wing nut. (One thing about negligent instructions, they may leave you wondering about how to assemble something, but if you do anyway and get it to work, you'll never have to wonder if you followed them well.)But beyond that it did not look too encouraging, the bracket is light gauge and it didn't strike me as either being in the right spot to grab the footplate of the saw or really provide a tight grip. It didn't.The front end of the saw plate tucks into the two front clamp things after you have slid them into alignment, basically any place they can get a bite. Run down the setscrews and hope for the best- my saw- an old but stalwart Makita worm drive- has a rolled front edge and the slotted setscrews could not find a perpendicular bite, instead tightening down at an angle. At maximum depth the slot disappeared into the threaded brass insert and would have kept going, due to the nature of trying to tighten a point vertically into a curve. I was then able to more or less find the best spot for that rear bracket, but even after I found about the only spot where I got a relatively solid 3-point mount, it was disappointingly wobbly. It's held in place more by suggestion than a positive mechanical connection.It must be incredibly challenging to design a device like this that attempts to be compatible with so many saws that have only rudimentary similarities but so many specific differences. I tried the Bora plate not only on the Makita, but an older Skilsaw circular and even older Black and Decker, the results were consistent. Whatever the primary target saw they had in mind was will remain a mystery. I am sure if you own that saw most of my complaints will seem petty; although with such lightweight materials and only a 3-point mount I would tend to doubt it.And that 3-point mount lets the outside corner of the plate droop when not in contact with the work surface, I realize the assembly is meant to be used with the weight of the saw making everything lie flat, any thoughts of being able to keep the plate attacked to the saw when using it for other purposes vanished. Not only do you lose nearly an inch (7/8"") of cutting depth due to the thickness of the plate, it's just not secure enough.The pointer- is it an afterthought? Since the rail must follow one pencil mark and the blade/pointer another, do you draw two or try to position the guide based on the correct cut line? Is this about speed, or accuracy? Initial tests show me that it's neither. The offset of the blade from the bar ended up as a fraction, while I tried to get it to offset to a round, easy to remember number like 4"", it would have been impossible given the limited mounting point choices.One could probably try to make a sacrificial cut through the plate to achieve this, but given the already dubious nature of its structural integrity, I feel getting it perfect without destroying it would be more trouble than it was worth, as I am not yet convinced this is the solution for me.I persevered: after it was good to go I took a practice slide down my melamine faced worktable and it was accompanied by an alarming screech. I would add unexpected, but I did see mention of it elsewhere. Still, while fingernails on a blackboard might be one way to describe it, it wasn't that bad, but it seemed louder and more unavoidable. I thought at first it was the slick surface of the melamine set vibrating the 15 edges of ribbing in a nice harmonic wail,  but I suspect you'd find this on any sheet goods, except probably something with a texture like OSB.If I were ever to depend on this thing more often than I expect, I would definitely stick a piece of adhesive backed felt on the bottom side and hope to not use it on very rough surfaces. I am trying to avoid a direct comparison to the Kreg, but they manage to avoid this situation by using a flat plate that is of different construction, and engineered to slide with the wood, not bully its way across it.I admit my test cut was on a board that would not be typical, I thought a try at squaring up an ratty old slab of quarter ply would be a good test. Plus it was a scrap anyway, and as it turned out (and as you may see in the video) the cut was not exactly the sharp square edge expected by a guide tool as flimsy and inexpensive as the Bora plate.To be fair, I will drag it out next time I need to rip a sheet for a few more passes, but for most situations the Kreg will do, and as I have found for years, if that falls short I can fall back to the good-ol' reliable shooting board.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QC85JSF0MUOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YWPIFAG#wasThisHelpful","R3QC85JSF0MUOZ","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have eaten Nature Valley frequently in the past, I would say these bars a an improvement over the ones I preferred in those days, but not by much.

"As you can see by that photo., the definition of a â€œbackpackâ€ has changed somewhat over the yearsBut the product behind the name Kelty has not, as proven in this fine, as we used to say, â€œday packâ€ (or even â€œrucksackâ€). This unit is a lot lighter than expected, the nylon involved in its construction seems to have been rendered even thinner than the lightest ripstop I recall. It compresses and can hold itself into near flatness, a nice feature when storing or traveling with unfilled, maybe in a real travel back as indeed a day pack.Iâ€™m not sure who the target buyer may be, perhaps student, but the clever little â€œaction pocketâ€ designed for POV selfies with a cellphone camera would indicate adventure of some sort, although school is still always an adventure for most.

Either way, not having a smartphone  Iâ€™ll never know, but even if I did, I see the little wallet has no rear access so operating it remains a mystery.It seems designed to be mounted on the two chest straps to shoot while you hike, I imagine you turn it on before snapping it on. If that doesnâ€™t do it for you, it can also be folds into a tent-shape construct secured with built in Velcro as a sort of back-country tripod.Overall the pack is more than adequate for any demand you might place on it- or in it. Light weave pads rest against your back, the front straps both have pockets at the lower edge which can be convenient for holding small objects to forget about. I find the twin chest straps odd, they are small (to fit the Action Pocket) and both have tiny clips, not the fastest to fasten or detach.The back flap has an exterior back flap which can be unfurled and held fast with 4 runners than unfurl from the main bag, ideal for jamming oversized goods within, a sleeping bag or something.Under that one is the top flap opening, revealing 3 mesh pockets, two of which have Velcro closures. Below them another flap exists to fold and keep the whole pack flat for light use or storage, pull it open- and itâ€™s not that easy to access- but you now have opened the pack to its full capacity.Itâ€™s well made and has enough room for anything I can imagine, depending on your mission.

It's not the largest or most powerful magnetic base I have ever seen, but if the surface you want to attach it to is flat enough it's perfectly adequate for the weight.The primary means of support is a pop-up plastic carabiner hinged to the base, you can clip it to just about anything with a loop in the end, or use the additional two provided carabiners to find even more attach points, it makes it easy to find a home wherever you areCompact and solid, it has a nice heft to it and appears quite well built, the charging ports are covered by a hinged plastic pop-out tab that looks a lot more long-lived than the usual rubber band.The light is powered by a hefty battery that can of course be used to charge just about any device you might have along on you camping trip, although a mini and a full sized USB poet out seem to be the norm these days for anything with adequate battery capacity, which is nice.The power switch is located on the backside, it would be considered the base if you used it on a table, but as this is clearly intended to be suspended, call it the top. Press it once and a row of blue LED's light up to show charge level, twice brings medium brightness, then again high, again for low. Seems an odd way to do it, but you get used to it. The penultimate button-push before ""off"" sets the light a-blinkng, which is primarily irritating, but could have some emergency location use for which I have not yet had a need. Unfortunate; it's an unhelpful and annoying feature for normal use.Charge time is quick, battery life on any setting is above average. I live in an area know for spotty electrical service, not only have I been a flashlight collector for years, now I have justification.I have not tested it for waterproof-ness, truth is I'd rather not find out the hard way that it was actually ""water-resistant"" than ""water-proof"". But it is well enough sealed that I believe it could take an accidental dunking and fare rather well.It's a great little package, we get the light itself, a very lightweight USB to mini charging cord, 2 extra carabiners and a little ""Ding-Dong"" Hostess Ding Dongs, 2 Cakes (Pack of 6) -like case to carry it all. Except- and to voice my only complaint, it doesn't. It's a tight fit with just the lamp, and just too small to get everything in. When I tried, the zipper got halfway round and broke. So, don't over pack and you'll be OK, but that reduces the handiness.This Sunree would be right at home anywhere, in addition to being at the ready in emergencies, I am already finding lots of uses in ordinary life, practically everything except camping, although when the power goes, it's not much different.(note: This product was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MVW880K2V5BK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBGCXFA#wasThisHelpful","R3MVW880K2V5BK","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With off-market brands going for the cost of these two OEM's, what's not to like? For a 20 YO refrigerator I was pretty sure it crossed over correctly, despite a few physical differences it mounted no differently than any of the others I have used. It did seem to take a lot longer to purge than I recall, and the water tap ran on and then dripped before eventually shutting off normally, but this icebox has not seen a lot of service over the years. Works fine now, no trace of filter residue, and the flow increased (yes, I measured it before and after) by about 30%.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3USY0NGPOPX5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UW3RO4#wasThisHelpful","R3USY0NGPOPX5W","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:21 Mins It's nice to find a starter package like this, but it limits a few things- like, how much you will spend to be sure you get the right air tool for your particular use, that you will in fact choose the correct pair (or trio) and writing a review in fact requires three times the information in a space where buyers usually have patience for the minimal amount of information merely for one. These are each decent tools that deserve more space to explore, but for a buyer, taking time to absorb meaningful details on all three from a single article is unlikely.So the grouping is somewhat arbitrary: We can start with the compressor, the heart (obviously) of a pneumatic arsenal. The BPFPO2012 is a low-end diaphragm pancake unit, perfectly adequate for casual use. No frills, nice quality. Even though it is a small thing, having a cord winding cleat and snap-lock plug clip is a nice touch.When I was making a video to compare the sound levels and pump up time to my funky old 8 gallon piston unit, it seemed like the Bostich was taking an unusually long time to fill. And was lots louder as well. When the piston unit shut off, I could hear the Bostich was leaking air, (as you may see in the video, straight out of the box.) When I saw the crimped on hose from compressor to tank, I feared the worst. Turns out it was just the tank drain valve left open by the factory, a quick twist and that was that.The compressor has a simple but decent regulator, again, with such low-end capacity you don't really need much more. Two outlet chucks facing left and right off the front panel are provided. From flat, the diaphragm pump complains its way to full in just under three minutes. Perfectly reasonable for a low CFM unit, but the sound kept reminding me of a 12-volt emergency tire inflator.There's really not much to know about an air compressor, even if you are new to them- where the drain is, how to use it, the power switch sort of stuff, but I always like to browse the book just to learn new things. In this case, the manual is a road map sized fold out sheet thing that suggests just how how much they want you to keep and use it for reference. I tried to find a printable booklet online, but it seems Bostich offers no manuals (and scarce product information)of any kind. I do not obsess on it, after a lifetime of avoiding them I eventually realized knowing some operational parameters can be helpful. Like, why there is a drain in the first place (but you already know that.)As far as the set as a whole, the notion of grouping tools like this is also reflected in the packaging and instructions- I have one older Bostich air stapler (and two other brands) that came in lovely cases having room to store an Allen wrench for service, the manual and a decent selection of fasteners- and in one case even a small oil supply. This pair came in cardboard sleeves.The instructions on the other stapler I have were concise and informative; the one provided here groups six staplers into one 13 page booklet. The model of each stapler is only to be found on a small sticker attached to the magazine, along with the size and range of fastener required. Both of these numbers are quite important, I would suggest a buyer take note, for at very least, you must keep in mind your model number when searching for info in the manual.The compressor is noisier and slower than my old one, but a lot easier to carry around. While my little one was actually capable of running my plasma cutter for brief intervals, I will not be looking at the Bostich for anything more than stapling. A few quick blasts of air to blow dust, filling a low tire, or even just changing tools will cause enough pressure drop to make the pimp run a lot more often than I would like. If you plan to do so, consider an additional tank, Torin T88011 Air Tank - 11 Gallon Capacity while shortening the life of the compressor ultimately, at least you will be able to maybe run an air ratchet or grinder for more than 3 seconds before it kicks on.It comes with a lightweight low-end hose that kinks easily, the couplers are permanently crimped on; if you're serious about getting into the air tool word, put it away and save it for an emergency.Speaking of the couplers, the tools also come with the male end installed- if you use the Milton standard (there are many) these are ""A"" type. Naturally, all my stuff is ""T"", so that definitely is another strike against the hose since the ends are crimped on. I have not purchased anything major in a long time, but any commercial and professional tools I have seen or bought come without. I suppose that's too inconvenient for DIY'ers, but if you're already set up on one standard (there are way too many) then it's a pain, or you have and have to use adapters already, which is also a pain.The bigger stapler here, the SB-1664FN is a bulky yet more business like finish nailer. I don't really care for the way ammo is loaded in the magazine, you pull back the follower and insert a clip of nails down into the magazine, then release the spring. I have used a few other guns that have other ways of loading, this is not my favorite- removing nails to change sizes is a lot more difficult, and God help you if you ever load the incorrect gauge. While the front end has a tool-free release to swing up the hood, it's nearly impossible to clear a jam if it's the wrong size.As far as the SB-1850BN, it fares slightly worse but for a different reason- the side cover slides back to load and access the nails, but in the event of a jam, the front plate must be removed with the (not included) Allen wrench. And if you need to do this, take careful note of the parts, part of the safety trip device is a small rod with a bushing that lays on an intermediate plate that will likely roll off and disappear when you disassemble. While I deliberately mis-loaded to see how it was to handle jams, as with many nail guns it is also really easy to do not on purpose, especially once your fasteners begin to migrate from their original packaging and you can't be sure of differences in length and but especially gauge.The trigger pads on both are fairly large and hard to place on edge with a great deal of accuracy, but it's not too difficult to overcome. The trip bars themselves can be held manually with moderate effort, as these are both sequential trip devices. Again I am puzzled by the manual, each method of firing is described for each gun, but not specifically assigned by model. I guess if you have to ask you wouldn't understand. Both have adjustable depth settings, something previously accomplished by varying the air pressure.As far as the function- oh, that- no complaints. But, nothing particularly unique or worthy of note, they are after all, essentially just air powered hammers that cut assembly time of repetitive and routine chores down by huge measures. They are also considered by many to be a replacement for real fasteners and a bit more skill in entirely inappropriate situations, but that's just my opinion. I have a decent assortment these now join, including a higher end Bostich, and apart from being able to dedicate one to a specific sized fastener, I really can't say I prefer the Bostich over, say, that ""purple"" brand.If you or someone you know wants a jump start into air fastening, you could do worse, but I would prefer to build an arsenal of tools individually based on specific needs and individual quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VIF55X0YMWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OXK1M8#wasThisHelpful","R1VIF55X0YMWO","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried nearly all the brands offered here and many that are not; after 20 years of cutting firebreaks over an acre of extremely challenging terrain with almost every other brand, the Husky blows them all clean away. Literally. The landscape is littered with different colored lengths of just about every other brand out there, and they all have one thing in common: they aren't short. I have yet to remove a Husky string from the head that had more than about 2"" left, and even then usually only because of a change in foliage or terrain.Rocks, asphalt and cement bring a typical amount of more rapid wear to the line, but this is no surprise. It is well balanced, over balanced even by the extended cutting time the Husky line gives me. I used to re-line about 3 times (or more) per tankful, now it's almost one-for-one; if I am cutting in nothing but high dead weeds I will almost certainly wear out before this line does,I am using the .105 line on a Husky 225 and while have used most sizes down to .065, I feel that the biggest line the machine can swing comfortably is the one I should be using, and while not hitting peak R's until a little wear has happened, it is still quite effective. And, it was the only size that was in stock locally, I was in the middle of cutting and could not wait for Amazon. Next purchase- whatever year that will be- I will likely try both sizes from Amazon, now that I am convinced this is the best line I have used to date. I have a feeling with this brand I could drop to the .095 and realize little difference for the same price. I have always encountered too much line spitting with smaller sizes, after about 14 hours of cutting with the .105 this has not happened, not once.I usually cut lengths to 9.5"", and it did seem a bit more than the trimmer liked, I can't believe the line is that much more dense than the others as to make a difference, but it does. But as long as the demands on that first inch are not too severe, it really allows me to stay at it longer, I just have to be more careful about planning my attack to be able to take advantage of the apparently different properties.A lot of the cutting is around rocks of all sizes, and re-lining was usually frequent, annoying and expensive. I also edge a 1/4 mile asphalt driveway, which is mainly clearing the surface of detritus and encroaching dirt- this will usually wear any other line to nubs in just a few minutes. Not the Husky- I gave up before it did, and moved on to other types of cutting so I could test it more thoroughly.I gave up on bump heads a long time ago, and a fixed-head can be irritating, but then so can rewinding. especially so often as the rough terrain can necessitate. But even that chore seems simpler with this line, it does not back out from the clutches appreciably and the ends just slide out as well and in reloading. I can even do it begloved, which also cuts the time way down.If I do find the smaller size adequate and Amazon does not offer the .102, I would have no problem committing to the longer roll. I can't say it makes cutting fun, but nearly- it goes so much faster, cuts even in a straight line or scything in either direction, it also really ""cuts down"" on the effort. I can also put in overly-long pieces, and use them as an ""air broom""; the breeze is wide and effective enough to blow clean the porch or walk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28RPSCB9D1HKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030MIHDM#wasThisHelpful","R28RPSCB9D1HKG","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Prior to seeing this device, I really had no idea the stem thing atop strawberry was referred to as a ""hull"". Hull sounds like that of a pea pod, or a walnut, or a boat, obviously. Of course, ""hull"" is the vulgate for ""calyx"", but this was even more obscure news for me. Is the top part of a tomato called that too?Speaking of tomatoes, I was glad to see another reviewer had success with that fruit. (Vegetable, whatever) I did not, but this leads indirectly to a point about the Oxo: it doesn't work all that well on smaller items.But on the larger ones, I was quite impressed. Not ever being  previously inclined to hull a berry, I usually just dug the stem out with a spoon, fingers, anything handy.No more. The Oxo has shown me enlightenment. Used properly it makes a lovely space in the top of a berry, quite perfect for filling with ice cream, whipped cream, sugar, your favorite thing to put on- and now in strawberries.At first I found the stainless blades to be rather flimsy, and seemed a bit wide spread to be able to dig into a berry top without destroying it. As I mentioned, this is true with smaller berries. The larger the better, just align it, stab and twist- out it comes. A push of the green button releases the stem- hull, sorry- and once you catch the rhythm you can decimate a basket in minutes.It seems to remove a rather large cone-shaped piece, but that's what leaves that space. And my wife enjoys nibbling on the divot. (But she likes apple cores too, so there's that)Another gadget I never know I needed, but as I do not often buy strawberries, it will be living in the gadget drawer along with the likes of its cousin, a cherry pitter.  Westmark Cherry PitterWhich also works quite well, but as it works so nicely on olives it will probably continue to see more use than the Oxo, but barely.I am sure there are more ""pro"" hullers out there, but if you, like me, have an overflowing gadget drawer, you will certainly able to make room for this affordable, useful though diminutive tool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R338TJIH74S36A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3W2RJO#wasThisHelpful","R338TJIH74S36A","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really curious about a whitening product that promised results in two days. Probably like a lot of people who try this system, I was facing it with a combination of hope and a complete lack of faith.After two weeks, I can't say I see significantly noticeable effects- though it seems I still feel something is happening and in my case it might be wishful thinking at best, at worst it will just take a while longer.I have my favorite toothbrush and paste, and the Colgate is not an acceptable substitute. The paste is extremely potent in a powerful minty way, the gel in the tube is somewhat slimy, but I primarily object to the brush. It seems cheap, with the bulk and fancy, pointless over stylization of most modern plastic goods, but designed primarily to allow the tube to be stored in the handle but lacking in every other aspect. It seems flimsy, it is a ""soft"" so I have already noticed bristles blowing out, and it isn't exactly overpopulated to begin with.The core of the brush is not bristles, but soft stalks of some foamy material that is supposed to spread the toothpaste more effectively. But strangest of all is an extruded pattern on the back of the head that seems to mainly irritate your mouth and palate as you work around your brushing, I can't see what role this plays in the process.So for now, all I can do is offer my results to date.

"So I had to reverse the title, sorry, Glenn.*(So maybe I should have gone with ""Amazing bass, how sweet the sound..?"")But I'm not kidding. Physically bonding the bottom end- literally and figuratively, if temporarily- of a speaker to a resonant surface produces astounding results. This may be the one we have been waiting for, or at least the first of what may soon become commonplace. Or for that matter probably already exists, but the Jam is the first to cross my path. Higher end component speakers try to minimize physical contact with surfaces that would produce sympathetic frequencies, the Jam exploits them in a surprisingly effective way.In the ""Storm"" mode, the base conducts bass like a heat sink, transferring low frequencies to whatever it's sitting on. I have long wondered why no one has yet done this, and even for the relatively low  price of this little unit, it delivers a huge punch for the size.Since I happen to be working at my desk while writing this, I tested where it sat. I built a desk out of ¾"" oak plywood, and it is large. The speaker was just sitting here, and as soon as it paired, Radio Paradise fired up, pencils and paperclips began wildly dancing around. The cat fled. It was loud, but I had to see, yes it went louder until the helpful voice told me, ""Maximum Volume"". The voice itself is annoying as usual, and can also annoy you in 4 languages. All too loud, and all too mechanical sounding. Includes a small ""key"" mounted to a custom plaque (in case you can't find one of those paper clips) which is inserted into a hole next to the power in port and pressed to change the language.A fifth choice sets the usual tones, in this case sounding like a snippet of a commercial.A sixth choice should have been ""silence"".Unusual speaker, very unusual packaging; enclosed in a semi-oval plastic shell (with a tin bottom, no less) we have the 3.5"" drumlike speaker sitting- no, attached to with a lens cap-like thing actually threaded onto a Â¼"" protrusion on the bottom which is about 1-1/4"" in diameter. It sticks through one end of a little plastic shelf, the accessory box sits beside it. The charger is a hockey puck shaped flip down prong type, slightly larger (and maybe harder to find wall space for) than a typical adapter.  It charges at 9.5 volts, and the cable has unique ends, so I suggest keeping both safe. It has become so convenient to use the ubiquitous 5.5 volt to USB adapter, but the higher voltage requirement could also suggest higher output. The cable is flat and tangle-free, as it is called, so they both might stand out a bit better.A smaller than usual ""quick start"" type guide seems to be the only literature, and not only is the print about the smallest I have seen that was intended to be useful. It also has that cheery, hip, flip attitude that I find so embarrassing in tech writing. It doesn't work for me.Absent also is an audio cable-I see the Jam has no aux input, a sign of the times, but still, so far, always a minus in my book. But, hey, they after all call themselves ""Jam Wireless Audio"", let's call it a draw.It paired immediately with my phone, (I had less luck with the true test of my funky old iPod and Sennheiser dongle) and will re-pair automatically after wandering out of range, but still requires a re-start of the source- not unusual.The speakerphone is OK, perhaps average for a device that must include a feature most people will likely choose to ignore. I tried my usual tests, voice recognition, answering machine quality.. true, I have no friends I might actually suffer to endure a live test. After using it with my old flip phone, I had to ""forget"" the device and re-pair to other devices, but this has happened before and is probably no big deal.The can-shaped speaker, with its little round base looks like a lot like an early satellite, wrapped in flat black wire mesh, nicely blended logo and Bluetooth symbol illuminating with a soft gray glowThe controls are atop the unit, and are a darker gray, rubberized material, a concentric ring has volume, pause, forward and back- I am not sure what the middle button does, but it has the Storm logo, like the control functions, embossed in that rubbery top. it sits in another pool of that gray glow and looks cool.  Pressing it controls the ""storm"" feature, obviously, which is the spectacular bottom end.Unfortunately, once again I have to wait to memorize the functions or use glasses before I will grow comfortable operating the speaker in low light. Plus, the - well, bottom end is kind of wiggly, which is just what it does whenever you press it or even just bump it thus making a different, more sensitive touch required to operate.Range is pretty good, about 50 feet straight line, maybe half that through a wall or two. Can't comment on battery life, it came ready to play, I rarely run one down for a review test, but 12 hours now seems to be the standard as advertised.*""It Must Be Jelly ('Cause Jam Don't Shake Like That) The music was written by Chummy MacGregor and George Williams and the lyrics by Sunny Skylar.

" 0:06 MinsOr as you might infer, ""Camping Shampoo""Long time ago there was a much discussed and advertised product very similar to Herbal Essences Dry Shampoo called  ""P-S-S-S-S-S-S-T"". (I think I spelled it right.) And I believe it was made by Clairol at the time. Oh, here we go- Wikedpedia: ""Psssssst Instant Spray Shampoo Not to be confused with Pssst*.""  I used it from time to time, and to the young uneducated oily-haired person not always shower-ready, it worked great. It is still available and has no doubt changed hands a few times.Seems like Clairol Dry Shampoo is an update, with the same methodology and results. I have since become more educated in hair product, at some point marrying an Aveda salon operator and beautician who generally prefers to see the house filled only with Aveda products.But I wanted to try the Clairol, and it does exactly as expected. Takes my rather thin and oily (and greatly thinned) hair on a no-wash day and gives it fluff and bounce, I can see this being in the desk drawer of busy office types, a backpack, or even a bathroom for the great unwashed.Containing as the main ingredients isobutane, alcohol, propane and tapioca starch, it's pretty clear how it works. In addition to putting your head in an extreme fire risk situation for a little while, the propellants must act as a solvent while the starch helps absorb the oil and as it dries, lend a somewhat unnatural fluff to your coif. Overly scented, looks not so bad, feels a lot better. If you are blessed with naturally stringy hair, you will probably be able to appreciate the results.I must confess I do not care for the scent, it reminds me of cheap deodorant. But the product works and could be quite handy. I can see just dusting your head with cornstarch for a similar result, but this is quite a bit more convenient. While the results are fine, I found it difficult to remove and it took two washes with fairly strong strippers to remove all traces. (That would be hair product strippers, unfortunately).Keep a bottle in your desk drawer, your backpack, your locker, wherever- it will come in handy when you really need it.* ""Psssssst Instant Spray Shampoo is a no-water substitute for traditional shampoo, popular in the 1970s; its popularity was widespread enough that it is considered a pop culture icon. The Nanny season 1 episode ""Maggie the Model"" featured a character who modeled for Psssssst during the 60s. It was produced by Woodridge Labs. Its history may date to the 1950s. The company recently began making Psssssst again. The back label of a recently purchased can reads: ""Between Shampoos- On Camping Trips- After Sports When Ill Any time you can't use water.

"At first glance I was a little bit disappointed at opening the Allen light, but after a closer look that soon faded. Most of my reaction was due to the seemingly, shall we say, ""lightweight"" construction of the mounting hardware, especially when compared to the lights themselves Until attached, of course, when it proves less can be more and it proves quite sturdy.It's mostly all lightweight plastic, rubber, and stainless, durable enough but clearly no more than need be, I realize there's not much point in putting too much weight into a part of a product that for the most part could be considered disposable. The clamps are quick to install and easy to adjust to any desired position, requiring only a slotted screwdriver and enough attention span so that you do not lose the tiny black plastic worm gear on the rear clamp.Both lamps attach to their clamps with a push-tab quick release and can be swiveled through 360Â°, the front through ratcheting detents, the tail just by friction.But the lights themselves are superb, very nicely made and finished. I try to avoid riding at night, but in some trials of this system, I was favorably impressed. The headlight throws a very powerful yet diffuse cone, it can be adjusted somewhat in size by sliding the barrel fore and aft. Shoved all the way forward it what might be called the ""spot"" setting, it projects an image of the PC board LED up close, sort of an interesting optic trick.I found the lens holder and the body were so well fit it slides with precision and smoothness, so tight it feels like it's pulling a vacuum. It is quality machining, but makes it a little bit hard to adjust while riding, should one need to. I suspect it will loosen up in time, but not so much as to become too slippery.Each click of the headlight on/off pushbutton at the back end of the case cycles through 4 modes: low, high, and flashing. You can also press partway to switch between modes. The taillight consists of a ring of red button LED's set in a reflector and is controlled similarly.I live well up a rather twisty country road, and it is not really true to say ""I wouldn't be caught dead riding here at night"", since that is actually the most likely scenario. In fact riding anywhere that is not amply lit for vehicular traffic has never, especially in recent years, seemed to me a very good idea. I feel both lights offer a significant presence to traffic of any sort, but it did not seen to really have a lot of power to punch far ahead, if you come to look for that in your cycling.I have also found the headlight to be quite handy in a number of other applications, living in that area that is on the twisty dark road, well, power events are common, so a useable but compact battery floodlight I always nice to have around, the Allen has a beam that serves equally well in many places.The center of the barrel has a rubberized surface which has nothing to do with use while riding but rather provide a solid hand grip. The plastic quick-release pad has recessed screws, and makes a great resting surface for the light- something rarely found in most flashlights, they just roll around in that loopy circle when you set them down. Another well-though out feature (or a happy accident)It also fits the hand perfectly and carries the shape, end edges and weight of many other small devices that have been shown to be quite effective in self-defense.I have seen many headlights- not even kits- in the $300 and above range, and of course many far cheaper than the Allen- but few in this zone of affordability that appear to be as well designed and manufactured.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V7RTJEL7QDIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4YD31E#wasThisHelpful","R1V7RTJEL7QDIT","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:06 MinsOr as you might infer, ""Camping Shampoo""Long time ago there was a much discussed and advertised product very similar to Herbal Essences Dry Shampoo called  ""P-S-S-S-S-S-S-T"". (I think I spelled it right.) And I believe it was made by Clairol at the time. Oh, here we go- Wikedpedia: ""Psssssst Instant Spray Shampoo Not to be confused with Pssst*.""  I used it from time to time, and to the young uneducated oily-haired person not always shower-ready, it worked great. It is still available and has no doubt changed hands a few times.Seems like Clairol Dry Shampoo is an update, with the same methodology and results. I have since become more educated in hair product, at some point marrying an Aveda salon operator and beautician who generally prefers to see the house filled only with Aveda products.But I wanted to try the Clairol, and it does exactly as expected. Takes my rather thin and oily (and greatly thinned) hair on a no-wash day and gives it fluff and bounce, I can see this being in the desk drawer of busy office types, a backpack, or even a bathroom for the great unwashed.Containing as the main ingredients isobutane, alcohol, propane and tapioca starch, it's pretty clear how it works. In addition to putting your head in an extreme fire risk situation for a little while, the propellants must act as a solvent while the starch helps absorb the oil and as it dries, lend a somewhat unnatural fluff to your coif. Overly scented, looks not so bad, feels a lot better. If you are blessed with naturally stringy hair, you will probably be able to appreciate the results.I must confess I do not care for the scent, it reminds me of cheap deodorant. But the product works and could be quite handy. I can see just dusting your head with cornstarch for a similar result, but this is quite a bit more convenient. While the results are fine, I found it difficult to remove and it took two washes with fairly strong strippers to remove all traces. (That would be hair product strippers, unfortunately).Keep a bottle in your desk drawer, your backpack, your locker, wherever- it will come in handy when you really need it.* ""Psssssst Instant Spray Shampoo is a no-water substitute for traditional shampoo, popular in the 1970s; its popularity was widespread enough that it is considered a pop culture icon. The Nanny season 1 episode ""Maggie the Model"" featured a character who modeled for Psssssst during the 60s. It was produced by Woodridge Labs. Its history may date to the 1950s. The company recently began making Psssssst again. The back label of a recently purchased can reads: ""Between Shampoos- On Camping Trips- After Sports When Ill Any time you can't use water. Psssssst is the convenient, quick fresher-upper for your hair.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18HTQU1X0PNRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FXOPP08#wasThisHelpful","R18HTQU1X0PNRJ","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It would have never crossed my mind to invest in a sound bar, I have always found the TV speakers were fine for 80% of my viewing, and the Denon surround system was more than adequate for the rest.  So a low end compromise like this was interesting to explore.And to realize, in the end, it could serve a far better purpose than trying to enhance a system not really in that much need.One thing that was not refurbished was the box; the original Vizio plain brown box and egg crate inside supports clearly had a few miles on them, but then the shipping box did as well, if selling ""refurbished"" items is going to catch on I would think a little better presentation is in order. The owner's manual looked like a 3rd generation scan of an enlarged copy of a quick-start guide.My first impression was that the sound was improved, but not by a very large factor. The ability to easily add a sub-woofer improves it's role as a go-between audio solution, but this too has drawbacks. As I played with balance and bias I began to appreciate some improvement. 2 inputs makes it extremely simple to attach an external device without getting involved in the surround system or an aux in to the TV.The Vizio is definitely low end, but I have few complaints. The controls atop the unit are small and almost impossible to see, due both to the way they blend into the case so well, but most likely any installation you may end up choosing. Hence the remote, which is also somewhat hard to see, it's thin, glossy black and not terribly well marked. It's assumed once you get it dialed in, you would use the TV control for audio, despite the fact using the Vizio remote could lend more flexibility to the use of the speaker.It's almost overcomplicated for what it is, and while I love using it, I wouldn't miss it if it went away. The price point is hard to beat, even  though I do not buy refurbished products and am not likely to start. It would be nice to see a tag indicating just exactly what was repaired, a warning for future problems perhaps. I would have to say it's a compromise- relatively improved sound volume and quality at the cost of the mess of another plastic box jammed in the space, six more cables, another wall wart, and another remote control.Actually, I think a more practical use at this point would be as a bedroom speaker, I would think a sound bar tucked behind the footboard, maybe even a small sub-dub down there would work out quite well. As long as you can hide the cables.In fact, as a real footnote, I accepted that in the entertainment console, the bar and cabling and added clutter of dubious merit, not to mention the virtually unusable remote were just not going to work out in the long term.This realization led me to mount the bar atop the folded jumpseats in the rear of my truck cab, which has only a stock 1995 Toyota stereo.I have been trying portables for years and only found one acceptable solution, the Fugoo Tough Bluetooth Wireless Speaker (Black/Silver) but it just couldn't cut it when combining a low input signal and the windows open at road speed. The Vizio, in what I would expect to be a not uncommon repurposing, has already passed the tethered trials with earsplitting success.I picked up the least expensive inverter I could find locally, wired it all together and propped up on the jumpseats for a test. It passed, exceeding my expectations, so I bent up a pair of acrylic brackets and had it semi permanently mounted in minutes. On the road it's ideal, I can finally hear just about anything I choose to play with decent clarity and response. Definitely better than the stock radio, and to keep volume control management simple I wired the radio output to the 2nd input on the Vizio. To cut down on cabling, I tried a Bluetooth setup BlueAnt RB-BKBL-US Ribbon Stereo Bluetooth Streamer- Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Blue but found it caused a significant drop in output and volume. Contrariwise, when cabled the quality at highest volume definitely begins to break up, but I'll settle. A sub-dub tucked away somewhere would help enormously, just not likely to happen soon.I remain quite pleased with this inexpensive alternative to a whole new stereo setup- or even a new vehicle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGMPZ46S4SUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IF0JD5K#wasThisHelpful","RYGMPZ46S4SUL","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a simple enough scheme, have an all-in-one disk that can either be worn as a pendant, carried on a fob or in a pocket, or snapped into a wristband and worn like a watch. Included band is sturdy, durable, inflexible and ugly black rubber. Did I mention uncomfortable?The most significant function of this device was that I was at last able to place it in front of my mother and let her have a hands on examination. But it was immediately evident that this device is not a practical choice for a person of her situation. It brought the matter into focus for her and once again opened the discussion of the need for a device like this, but once again after evaluating nearly all the options, even an apparently simple solution such as this takes a little too much management to be even close to practical.For one living alone with part-time caregivers, but still at large risk from falls, even a minor accident could become a life threatening event. In a situation like that I would prefer to stick with the simplicity of a call-center monitored device, and one that has some type of voice capability. The V-ALRT has the ability to respond to a bad situation, but only via the app and the phone, 2 more things to manage, two more weak links- and with it learning, programming and to a certain extent maintenance, which runs counter intuitive for the truly needy.  Unverified receipt of the SOS call or text is the scariest. And if you are on the receiving end? â€œHey, I got this call from Mom but no one was thereâ€¦â€. Not to mention unknown issues that can truly be discovered only with a real-life test or two, something no one wants to experience, let alone simulate.I do not think this is the best choice for the usually thought of demographic, but perhaps to reach a new one- this being someone like myself who frequently work alone, in high places and remote areas and doesnâ€™t always remember to carry the phone on the job.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10R7N92E5LUF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZM7ZVQ#wasThisHelpful","R10R7N92E5LUF0","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An LED alternative that is essentially everything it claims to be. Or that I could wish it to be; even the price is not unreasonable.It hit 110Â° today about 4 PM. My 3""X3"" office closet is never a pleasant place to be, but when the house cooks for a few days in three-digit temperatures it is a walk-in oven. And that's without the light on.Which was until recently a 75 watt eyeball-style can fixture. I installed a dimmer just to keep the heat down. I had never considered CFL mostly due to light color temp and non-dimmability, even the ""dimmables"".So the GE LED flood was a welcome surprise and an immeasurable improvement.I have been wanting to try a replacement for PAR flood and spotlights for a long time, but they have long been out of the price range. The GE has dropped somewhat since their introduction, and the quality in almost all regards has contrariwise risen. For a great number of reasons, although not checked out any competing models, I was immediately impressed by this ""bulb"" and immediately recognized a few significant reasons to consider an upgrade.One thing puzzles me, with so many screw-in replacement LED floods available, are there that many cans that a simple solution will not fit? LED floods tend to run a lot smaller than incandescents, so I imagine this is one way of addressing the situation. I appreciate the design of this unit, but unless there was a glaring need to retrim a can I would probably go with the simple bulb change first.Changeout was a snap, the ""bulb""- it is actually a self-contained fixture- comes with a light socket pigtail that mates to a molded body 2 pin connector. For a standard PAR-30 screw-in it would be as simple as removing the old lamp, pulling off the trim, screwing in the pigtail then pushing the device up into the can. The color and temp of the light is perfectly acceptable and nearly identical to the one that originally occupied this fixture. I compared it to the few remaining original fixed fixtures- milk glass lenses- and the difference was subtle. The LED is not as diffuse as the lens, but then it is also not a piercingly hot flood, either.The instant-on of the LED is still noticeable to one who has a lifetime of only the millisecond warm-up of a filament, but that's just me. I notice it in new autos as well, and it reminded me of incandescent that run on 220V.I know what happens when you run a 110 bulb at 220v, but whatever an LED might do will remain a mystery for now.The box lists a number of dimmers that are compatible with the fixture, which of course I did not read. I use the same switch throughout the house, and as with the bulbs themselves, a major retrofit is not likely. They performed acceptably, a bit notchy perhaps- probably just due to a combination of the age of the switch and the way that the LED reacts to a simple rheostat-type controller. But it works well enough, and while in this application will likely not be dimmed often, it was still a good test.I was concerned that the spring clips on the GE might grab something that they might not want to release at some point in the future, but this was not the case. They slid in perfectly and held tightly, but pulled right back out with ease.All of my fixtures here are 8"" diameter, but the GE is 7.5""- not really a problem, but if I were planning a large scale upgrade I would certainly want to check the old cans first- I am sure an adapter ring could fill the void, but it would also cut down on the ease of installation quite a bit.Drawing 10 watts instead of even a dimmed 75 is an obviously huge savings. Whether or not it will ever reach a payoff point of course depends on use, and would certainly be aided by replacing all the fixtures in the house.Of which there are many. The designer went nuts over recessed lighting, I count 22 in the house. All sucking energy like it was 1969.In any case, for now, I do not have to think about that again, at least not in my closet. When the price falls and more varieties are available, I would not think twice about retrofitting all of them. Especially the ones in the 14' ceiling.

"All of the fluorescent fixtures in my house use 2 or 4 tubes, 4 and 8 feet all are (except the ones since failed) at least 15 years old. I assumed (as hidden in the literature somewhere) older ballasts would not work with an LED tube, but I was fairly confident I would not mix an LED with a gas tube on the same strip. Both proved true, so I could either buy another LED tube just to test, or pick up a one-lamp fixture, which I did.It was interesting to note that single tube fixtures are much less common- and significantly more expensive than even multi-tube ones with more features.I attached a temporary cord and switch so I could carry to from room to room and simulate an installation, see how the color temp and brightness fit into each location. While obviously not providing as much light as would a full 2 or 4 tubes, it rendered a fair representation. I do not know how many LED color choices are listed at this time, but it seems it should be a simpler issue to provide a good solution for any room.I liked the idea that although more flexible, the tubes are so much safer; and noted that when these catch on a whole subsection of manufacturing will take a hit- whomever it is that makes the plastic safety shields for hazardous location glass tubes will need to be repurposing.There is no start up or flickering, typically a feature of older and moribund tubes, (and one that will be immediately un-missed) and I suspect the LEDâ€™s will be operating pretty much the same in ten years as they did for this test. One small surprise- when powering down, the tube actually briefly fades out, not unlike an incandescent.It should have been no surprise to note that the LEDs fire in one direction only, what is now the backside of the tube was covered with labels. Unshielded, non-reflector fixtures seem to no longer be used in many places, so the loss of essentially half the light from an old gas tube will not likely be missed, and certainly helps the power savings.While by no means definitive, and conditional as much on the ballast as the tube, a quick check with the Kill-A-Watt shows the Philips, listed as a 14 watt replacement for a 32 in fact drew 19.The â€œcontrolâ€ bulb was a 40W Sylvania that in fact drew 27.Upgrading even a small fluorescent installation will not be an inexpensive proposition, the price of tubes does not seem to have taken as dramatic a tumble as other types of bulbs. Since the cost of operating fluorescents has never bee as outrageous as incandescent, (donâ€™t forget- they have always been touted as an institutional and inexpensive alternative to filaments- hello, CFL?) the biggest attraction may be the service life- although come to think of it, some of my tubes are still at it after ten years.And not usually mentioned is what I feel to be the biggest advantage to using alternatives is disposal. (Funny how for so many years the tubes would just sort of vanish. Or stood in as the earliest light sabers in mercury-dust choked duels. Who knew?) And now some services charge what can only be considered outrageous disposal fees.But between the â€œindefiniteâ€ life of the LEDâ€™s and the as-yet unknown (but presumably simpler) disposal methods, this is a consideration worthy of note.(Years ago, I was having a meeting with my employer-at-the-time, we were discussing spares storage. I was standing close to some new cases of 8 foot fluorescent tubes, stored on end. Too close. One box fell over in slow motion, as it hit the floor the sound was impressive. When the dust settled, all he said was â€œThink any made it?â€ )But still: I bet the private use market is a challenge for the manufacturers right now, selling what may be a once in a lifetime swap for most people, and while it may not have a blindingly fast payback, at least a reduced need to change tubes in difficult locations will be quite alluring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKOQZ0XBT66H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JY3QZSU#wasThisHelpful","R2YKOQZ0XBT66H","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is said ""to a hammer, the whole world's a nail."" To a cat, the whole world's a toy.I thought the gang would flip over this, but not so. The noise didn't bother them, and while the flying projectiles momentarily required their attention and warranted a chase and a sniff, that was about it.So I was left to experiment on my own.An 8 chambered dart-holding ""barrel"" resembles a minigun, but that's where any similarity to anything real ends.It has two little fold-up wings that are intended to provide some measure of protection for a shooter, rather than shields they more closely resemble a Star Wars craft. Once I folded back the flaps and played with it a minute or three, I pulled them off, set them aside, and lost them immediately. I do not consider this a great defensive setback.The Blaster is an overt expression of why we love guns, all festooned with clever molded red, blue and gray plastic shapes that give it a space (or Nerf, or S.Soaker) sort of appearance. And have nothing to do with the action.Which is somewhat odd and a bit tricky to master. After stuffing your darts into the 8 chambers, the grip (and half the aim) is maintained by the rear handle. Pulling back the front one charges the firing mechanism- spring loading? then releasing the dart at the full pull, presumably whilst you are attempting to lock in aim. On the front stroke the barrel rotates to the next dart.Although it comes with a target, this gun is not for target practice. Accuracy can be learned, but it takes a lot of effort and does not seem to be the main point, which is most likely to have a bunch of your friends over and just unloading on each other.The included target is only about eight inches square, the whole backside is coated with an adhesive of unknown permanence. I would be careful where you place it, it might be there awhile. I used 3M mounting tape at the corners for now, which might affect it's dart-holding power.Which is another thing: probably the most amazing feature of the toy is the darts- the business end. They are tipped with a soft rubberize substance that adheres to the target surprisingly well, and comes off with a bit of reluctance. The rubber stretches and distends as you pull it off, I am mystified what might be that compound. The tip returns back to the original shape no matter how stretched out it became. I have experimented a bit and have still not come up with anything to which they will likewise adhere.Well made for a toy gun, I am not a parent (that should be apparent) so I can't say if the price is reasonable or not, but seems so. There are accessories galore, (and eye protection does not seem to be a bad idea.)The method of propulsion is unclear, but it takes a lot of pull to crank one off. the construction of the darts is a 2.5"" hollow light plastic stem, which would suggest compressed air, but this does not seem to be the case. Only a field strip would answer the riddle, and I am still having too much fun with it for now.The darts are also extremely easy to lose, I would pick up a spare set or two if you are serious. I noticed the open ends are fairly delicate, after a few shots (or maybe a ""Cat Scan"") the edge became slightly damaged and caused a hangfire situation.They do not fly exactly 75 feet as claimed, the best I could measure (indoors) was about 50. But that's plenty, and requires a bit of windage to achieve even that.If you plan to rapid fire, do not plan to be accurate to less than about 5 square feet- the effort to cock and release the projectile is significant, and while seeing the barrel spin as it's blowing through a whole clip looks pretty cool, it really waves the thing around a lot. It's also impossible to shoot with one hand, which may or may nor be a bad thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GGYKEB5QO9KF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBW8NMO#wasThisHelpful","R1GGYKEB5QO9KF","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The prevailing impression I have of this  camera is that it is identity challenged. On one hand, it is absolutely full of high-end features when combined with the overall quality of both construction and performance make for a solid high-end workhorse. But there are other aspects that donâ€™t fit- essentially the aspect of marketing itself to the pop crowds, the casual user for whom selfies are a main function.Then there are the colorsâ€¦.  Fun and unique but in my narrow mind not much more than silly. Let the personalization come from the images, not the device that makes them. .It would for all intents seem to be yet another purse/pocketable aim-n-shoot, but it is far to good just for that, (not to mention pricey) and the detaching- and somewhat protruding included lens makes that even more unlikely. The included lens is a good choice for starting out, but I have noticed other variants of this package come with an additional lens â€“ usually a telephoto - that adds a bit more flexibility to your photos.For a semi-pro camera trying to bridge the gap to the casual user, this is not a bad unit. The picture image quality is outstanding (said one coming from using a 6 MP Sony) the balance and ease of use is somewhat above average, but it struck me as a compromise- not enough to really be considered truly high-end, and still laden with features those using a purse or a pocket for a camera bag might not ever have a use for.First experience with a Samsung camera, and while I would not necessarily choose this for myself, it does have the requisite number of features jam-packed into it. I have spent much time trying to remember the hundreds of the features and functions of several DSCâ€™s, and usually end up falling back to just the few needed to produce the shots I am after.  I shot film SLR for a very long time, and found the simple functions found therein never left me wishing I had anything more.The Samsung as offered does not zoom, so in a way I canâ€™t consider it a drawback, but if anything demonstrates a leaning to the professional. â€œseriousâ€ user. (Just like the colored bodies. And the flip-around screen for selfies.)Most recently, my needs run to a convenient, bullretproof all-in-one package, so I find the Samsung to be somewhat unsuitable. I think at this price you had better be sure of what you are buying, many other more complete â€œconsumerâ€ models nay be had for less.The lenses are of course available, along with an adapter ring. I have not seen this accessory needed as a separate purchase in other cameras, and when I have needed to use them I have usually bought two- there is no bag included, I have not carried my bulky Domke case for years, and I would prefer to not have to stuff the uncovered lens- no lens cap, either- into a pocket.

I am sure that in the years of development this thing has had it has it has been developed and refined to the needs of the customers, whatever size and it seems to reflect that.My old one had a business card holder, a credit card holder and a sticky note dispenser that are not present in the Keeper, but I also have not missed them so far.I imagine compared to your average Target fall special it could be considered pricey, but there is of course that allure of a name this well known.It's certainly not whatever executives or wanna-be's may be carrying around today, some might chide me on my choice or recognize it as practical (or immature) but in any case I find it is a great all-around organizer that is solid, durable and not burdened by features that look handy but are never used.But, while I have since abandoned this particular application of the TC, I have no doubt it will carry on as the binder of choice being carried into the classroom.Oh, OK: ""Cartman gets a new Trapper Keeper Futura 2000 that blows Kyle's Trapper Keeper out of the water. When he finally stops bragging, a stranger informs him that it will eventually fuse with other computers into a powerful super being, take over the world and destroy humankind if they don't destroy it first. Cartman refuses to accept that he must live without his Trapper Keeper and becomes infused with the high tech folder. Kyle must do anything he can to separate the two and destroy the super being.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H5XZ2GKCHIE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O3GQ4E#wasThisHelpful","R2H5XZ2GKCHIE7","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There, I got that out of the way.Even though I have not previously heard of Kenco- not being a very active participant in this type of optics- they were unknown but soon proved to be very high quality of construction and optical clarity. They are considered â€œwater-resistantâ€, not waterproof, so I imagine that would suggest they are suitable for use in rainy or duck-blind like situations, they might not cut it on a dunk surf or poolside. No big deal, I rarely travel to any of those.But for me, while not really powerful enough for long-range spotting of my canyon environment (and with only one intrusive neighboring house about a mile away) I found they were great for peeping closer at the abundant wildlife- notably, and obviously birds at close range. Crystal clear and lightweight, they are a lot less bulky and steady than my big Costco Bushnells and allow for extended viewing without causing tired muscles or cramping hands, something about which I had never thought.Focusing is fast and simple, using a rocker between the barrels. Before use the eyepieces must be twisted in position, I am not clear why, but compactness might be a reason. It took me a few seconds to figure this out, my stupid, but the instructions seemed to be of little use, I mean, how simple could it be? The only complaint I could muster was the eyepiece lens cap is a whole cover, and did not fit well at all, no matter what position the binoculars were folded. This does not seem to be a one-off situation but a design flaw, hopefully Kenco will read some of these reviews and attend to the problem. The front fit fine, but they snap inside the rim of the lens and are sort of cheesy compared to the rest of the binocs, of the lens. As with most lens covers I have encountered, could easily disappear in a matter of minutes.To one ignorant of the lineup of manufacturers, the pair seem pricey, I have not yet shopped very much for comparison but I have reason to suspect this could also be a sign of that higher quality I am incapable of appreciating. They work well.Included is a soft pouch case, like the lens caps a bit low-end for the price and compared to the main feature. Even the packing box seems cheap, especially if you have ever seen a higher-end pair of headphones in this range which are more like little shrines. A nylon strap and cleaning cloth, scarcely worthy of note round out the package. .","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84FCHQIBYV5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DYQRME#wasThisHelpful","R84FCHQIBYV5J","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It works, works not merely better than I expected, but dependably and reliably and at a price anyone  simply should expect. The most unexpected feature was how much more quickly and easily it found and joined my home network. I recently added an AC extender which, no matter how configured, just confused my laptopâ€™s built-in card. I usually had to do a â€œrepairâ€ to get it going. Not so the Netgear, it sees and joins almost as soon as I have the lid opened .Perhaps this sounds trivial to more contemporary demands, but I was pleased by this improvement.After trying a few other brands of Wi-Fi adapters manufactured by relatively new companies who seem shameless at borrowing the â€œfeelâ€ of an established company name or design, I had pretty much decided to limit my future purchases to the more familiar brands.And not without reason- the last no-name USB adapter I tried did not work at all. But it was cheap.. So, returning to a known dependable make was in fact safe bet.The Netgear installation CD ran quickly, and even though it took awhile to search for non-existent online updates, this is still an optional feature. Which in any case I always find amusing with a connectivity product, suppose you are replacing a failed one and donâ€™t yet have a way to connect? Well, thatâ€™s just picking nits.After running the CD and rebooting- another vestige of the old days, inconvenient with older, slower machines- in this case an older Lenovo XP laptop, but it always makes me feel like something has actually been installed. The control panel for the unit showed up unobtrusively and proved simple and easy to operate. I like having other dashboards to let me know about the state of connectivity, relying on one could throw the bias on whichever manufacturer created it. Using one or two others gives the user a different opinion and means to control any of the devices, as well as check performance, obviously.Plugging in the adapter gets you going and runs automatically, the dashboard is activated from the system tray or a desktop icon.This one is simple, showing available networks and status thereof, speed, signal Internet connect info and control options. The adapter offers a basically automatic connection to your useable network, as well and the WPS button push method of connecting to your router, or entering your info manually. Really nothing exceptionally remarkable, but itâ€™s uncrowded and easy to use.Which is great, at least for speed of connection and range, even though I have a gigabit router, 300M seems to be the upper limit. Might be also impaired by the no-name AC extender I am using as well as its own speed limitations. I am not that well versed in shopping by numbers, it is usually based on what I can afford, and anything in that category that promises to be an actual improvement.It seems to connect more quickly than the on-board adapter, which is hardly surprising, and switches easily between the two. I find the dongle a little longer than others I have used, but my mouse plug protects it nicely- unless I am mouseless and using the touchpad. But, not much to do about that, with only 3 ports I am used to guarding them, not only physically but in rationing them as well. I carry only a skinny hub, good for portability but not for power or data transfer.I see that many users of newer machines and OSâ€™s seem have a lot to be unhappy about, so maybe this can now be considered a â€œlegacyâ€ device, which would explain why it works so well for me bit not they. And these days this is all too well, I imagine because of the continuing and die-hard XP user base this could become a niche market- like the manufacture of replica vintage car parts.So, despite a lot of less than pleasant experiences as indicated by other reviews, I had no problem at all with the Netgear and would certainly still keep that brand in the forefront.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BAUDBFIG49F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006V72AHW#wasThisHelpful","R2BAUDBFIG49F7","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually despair at reviewing software, in order to do it justice it takes almost a concerted daily effort to at least become familiar with as many of the features as deadline allows. But I had already become so frustrated in quite a few areas by lack of a PDF product that I was able to put Nuance Power PDF to work without hesitation.Off the top: a feature I have been needing of in a PDF utility made it worth the price of admission almost immediately after installing Nuance PDF Pro Basic: I can now convert printable only  PDF forms- usually employment applications- into online fill-ins in a matter of seconds. Many organizations- not just potential employers will accept only a PDF. Not only does this save me at least an hour an app but I have also noticed, when submitting in person, a neatly typed application is often more warmly received than my normal penmanship.(On the other hand, some employers demand the application be filled out on premise, by hand.)The alignment in boxes is not always perfect, but then my handwriting seldom is; the checkboxes look pro.One also has the ability to keep editing the form, i.e under ""Shift Wanted"" you can add an ""any"" box where none existed in the original.  Or just throw in some whimsical field just to see if anyone notices. I wish I'd had this years ago. The result is clean and professional, and really easy to accomplish. My main hopes were that it could easily convert my resume and letters to a PDF, which is the only accepted  format by many employers. Maybe just to pose another challenge to the supplicant. I mean, applicant. Sorry.But I digress. Again.Another amazing but simple touch by Nuance solves the age-old (OK, 25 years maybe) problem of transporting software to new computers. Nuance simply allows the user to de-activate the registration, install it on the new (or restored) machine then re-register. Genius.I did have a fit at first when installing, despite the Amazon description as being XP compatible, the box did not. I have seen this go either way sometime, so I took a breath and let the install rip.No problem. Which simply means that these days of dwindling XP support it will take a little more research to be certain you- we older users can run the software.It does hijack the default opening program and change the association, which is a minor issue, and can always be changed back should the differences be annoying enough. In Explorer, new PDF commands are added to the right-click menu. There is also added what seems to be the Nuance hue, a weird shade of purple which shows up everywhere.It seems to take longer to open files than the reader I was used to, but clearly a program with this many capabilities has a lot more going on. It also installs an icon in the system tray (if you still know what that means) but to me it means something is running in the background I probably would not miss and so disabled it.And new toolbar buttons will appear in all Office apps, I am not sure if I will be using them with any frequency but I really don't know how handy they will be in fact, or if the continued use of older Office versions will pop up as a problem. Seems one way or another we will all eventually be compelled to upgrade. But, if so I suspect a re-install will allow me to remove anything I find unnecessary and possibly resource consuming- I know some parts of Dragon can slow things down and I have learned to work around them as well.The forms, menus and toolbars are familiar looking, but just slightly odd enough to remind us that this is not a Microsoft boot-licker. Some other products- most notably from our neighbors to the north change the look so radically it takes even longer to adapt. While Nuance presents different appearance, it is not particularly a challenge to master. And if it is indeed, as another reviewer pointed out, a deliberate finger in the air to MS, then so much the better.Almost any feature a typically frustrated non-power PDF user may run into can he handled here. At one point I was able to use Adobe Acrobat, basic versions can be had as low as about twice the Nuance version,  it worked as well as you might expect, but I also have discovered the Nuance version to be adequate and if you're on a budget, quite satisfactory.I have also used Nuance's ""Dragon"" apps, and been suitably impressed by both the features and design, and am now discovering the integration between the two might find me reaching for my headset when filling in these job applications, being able to dictate the oh-so repetitive information has just gotten easier, I am not altogether uncertain I may soon be able to directly import info from my Excel database. I am also preferring to believe at some time in the near future I may no longer need to participate in this process at all.But in the bright side, it has allowed me to perform several urgent real-time tests, and you can be sure I am working my way through as many of the features as possible and keep discovering more helpful ones.Another feature I have longed for since I was first exposed to scanners and OCR is the ability to convert an already-scanned graphic-only image of a printed page into an editable document, be it Word, Wordpad, Notepad- whatever. Power PDF handles this, although it took a fair amount of stumbling around to accomplish. The help was really not very helpful, (offline help would not even open) but I think with use this will become much easier and truly useful.I keep discovering many features as I explore- one will convert any item on the Clipboard to a PDF, I tried it with a random JPG Facebook card-thing, and while it did not leave the text editable, it was able to make it searchable- something I have wanted to do from time to time but never thought possible. It might also be it can be edited by further manipulating the image and I just haven't discovered the method.You can add watermarks, something else that has long been possible for me, but never really that easy. Or absolutely necessary, but now that I can, I will. I also had a slight bobble, when I opened a PDF file by clicking it in Explorer, it did so with the ""Nuance Demo"" watermark imprinted and asked me to activate/register. I already had, but before I called Nuance I found it only happened if I opened a file this way, not through the main menu. It doesn't bother me that much, but it also isn't right. If it happens again will be making that call.While it also claims to not support anything older than Office 2007, which will limit my testing a bit, I was able to get one test sheet converted (as well, of course, as simple DOC to PDF conversions) using my hobbled copy of Office 2003. As I mentioned I do not know what other obstacles I may encounter, but it is, after all, essentially a PDF-centric product, Office integration (beyond document conversion) was not really on my mind when I began to use this. It also has its own scanner drivers and software, but as I am recently just recovering from a loss of my original HP software, I am reluctant to try it without a system backup in case it also hijacks it, I somehow got an earlier version of the HP ware restored and I find I prefer it for most tasks. Still, I look forward to seeing what they've accomplished, my split between photos and OCR is about 90/10, so I am in no hurry.I will not simply list features off of the box, I will continue to explore and play, and now that I have solved a few pressing problems, it's fun. Like learning new software used to be. It is considered a typical method of dodging the responsibility of writing a truly in depth (or even superficial) review to say, ""I'll list more features as I discover them"" and of course never come back to do so. Whether or not I do edit this to be even more absurdly long, I know I will keep finding new things in Nuance PDF Pro Basic to get enthusiastic about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JKY89L2IED6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKM077A#wasThisHelpful","R2JKY89L2IED6E","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had hoped this would be a video review, but alas, not are our gray squirrels apparently too smart, another Havahart product previously applied Havahart Critter Ridder 3145 Animal Repellent, Ready-to-Use Spray, 32-Ounce seems to still be working quite well. Or, my choice of peanut bitter for bait was not to their liking. Not to mention, there are so many of the little buggers about that trapping one would be for research purposes only (and OK, maybe payback for the torment they have given my cats); releasing one into ""the wild"" around here would be not only pointless and scary (they're fierce), but contrary to County ordinance.The trap is about the right size for the smaller models of rodent, and would probably also do nicely with some of the mega-rats I have encountered, but they are relatively uncommon. Other sizes are available with attendant scariness at the prospect of bagging a larger prey.Nevertheless, I have examined and closely tested this device, it is superbly crafted and at a really reasonable price. The trap doors can be opened at either or both ends by simply looping the draw cable for one over a conveniently placed hook, a large and easy to use handle then draws both doors open with a very light effort.It is also sprung with a light effort, I measured it about 3 ounces, but it is more the rattling movement of the target that helps set it off with very little fuss. I noticed if it is tipped very far to one side or the other it is even more sensitive, but I can't see this affecting operation.I am not sure how you and your local animal control fell about the ""release"" part of a live trap, but if it is not a problem I could scarcely imagine a better built and more reliable trap than the Havahart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WCUVKFTRINJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045R5VT4#wasThisHelpful","R2WCUVKFTRINJF","AUCIFMWP3DU8R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCIFMWP3DU8R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Seriously such a brilliant idea! 2 chargers in 1! We are primarily an Apple device family. We have iPhones, iPads, iPods and such but we also have selfie sticks, power banks and portable speakers that all use micro USB chargers. This charger conveniently puts both together with the iPhone 5/6 attachment connecting to the micro USB. No more carrying 2 chargers or forgetting one or the other. I tested it on both devices and receives no errors at all. I also love the flat cable design because it doesn't get tangled like other chargers. They also have plastic caps for the ends but honestly it'll probably get misplaced eventually unlike the iPhone attachment since it's connected.I received this product free of charge for evaluation purposes.

"Almond flour is exactly what it says, almonds ground into flour. It does have a different flavor and texture compared to regular flour but it's a great alternative. This is great for people who are gluten free or watching their carb intake. It has a good amount of protein and fiber too. I love to use almond flour for baking.

"I love this stainless steel double wall ice bucket. It has a handle for convenient carrying and a lid to cover it. This is perfect when you have guests over or having a dinner party so you can keep ice at the table for your guests. It would also be great for bbqs. I actually took this with me to a party I went to so I could keep my ice separate from the cooler. When you think about it, people put their hands all up in coolers so I wouldn't want to use that ice in my drink. It's also double walled so it did melt slower than normal.

"This beautiful bracelet is made of rose quartz beads and also a heart pendant. Rose quartz is known as the love gem stone. It is also said to increase fertility. It's a beautiful bracelet! It's stretchy and can fit a good sized wrist. The only thing I don't really care for is the gold clasp that's attached to the heart. After coming off twice, I just left it off and wore the bracelet without it. This would be great for a new mother and also as a baby shower gift.

"This Flower Girl Bridesmaid Bridal Tiara Comb is made with clear crystal beads and rhinestone crystals in a silver plated setting. The tiara is well made, not flimsy at all. At its highest point, it measures 1 5/8"" and 4"" wide. The metal clip measures approx 1 1/2"" by 2 1/2"". It's attached very well. I tugged and pulled at it to see if it would come apart and it didn't budge at all. The comb itself is a little flexible which helps to get it in place. I love that the comb part isn't plastic that could break easily. This is perfect for any little girl who loves to pretend she's a princess like my toddler. She loves to dress up with her princess dresses and shoes. This is the perfect final touch.

"I don't have major breakouts but I have oily skin, occasional pimples on my forehead area and sometimes near my nose. Before I was recommended this line by a friend, I had been using a face wash that seemed to make me break out more than help. I also have sensitive skin so I'm always a little worried when I try new products. I've been using the step 1-3 from this line for a few days now and it's gone very well. No redness, no itchiness or any kind of reactions to the products. I've only been using it at night and for my face I don't feel the need to use it twice a day. I used this face wash after using the face mask. Just a little on my fingers with some warm water and I got a good amount of lather. My face felt refreshed and clean. After using the products for a few days I have already noticed a difference in my skin. So far I haven't had any breakouts and I usually do around this time of the month. My skin isn't as oily but it's not dried out either. I love that a good portion of the ingredients are organic.

"I have the turquoise case with the blue mandala design and it's beautiful! The colors and design are very eye catching. On both sides there is a raised diamond ridge pattern that helps you to grip your phone. The case fits nice and snug and gives good protection on all sides. All the buttons and cutouts function properly. Because the case is a lighter color, it looks a little dirty after over a week of use. I tried to clean it off but it's stained. The design on the back is a sticker, which I didn't expect. It had a bubble that was lifting a little in one of the corners when I got it, but nothing major that I couldn't press down. I'm not sure how well it will hold up after a few months. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect based on the pictures but it sure wasn't a sticker! I really do like the case, but if I were to get one of these again I would go with black. I think it could also use a slightly more raised bezel (hope that's the right word I'm looking for) on the edges. The edges are the same thickness as my glass screen protector so if it were to fall *knock on wood* my screen protector would probably still crack.I received this case free of charge for evaluation purposes.

"Ink cartridges can be very pricy! I started purchasing remanufactured ink a few years ago to save money and also filled some myself. I have never had any problems. I read some of these reviews and got a little scared that it might turn into a mess. I opened the cartridge over the sink just in case it would leak. I pulled off the orange cap and nothing came out. I received this just in time since my ink just ran out on my HP all in one B210. As with all remanufactured ink, once I got it loaded in there was an error message that it was not a genuine HP cartridge. Just press ok and go on printing as normal.

"I love this 2 in 1 foam roller! It's perfect for relieving muscle tension and sore muscles. It has both high and low density foam so it's great to get into all those hard to hit spots. I like to use it from my shoulders all the way to my lower back. You can also use it on your calves as well. I actually have similar foam rollers but what I love about this one is that one fits inside the other. You get the inner black roller which is a lot denser than the outer roller. Sometimes I just like to lay on my back and have this one at my lower back so I can stretch. The outer roller is a softer foam over a PVC core. Both rollers don't lose their shape.

"These containers are perfect for leftovers! It's microwave safe so you can take it straight from the fridge and heat it in the microwave. Perfect to take to work, meal prep etc. I actually don't like my food to touch so I have compartment bento boxes as well but those could never fit my salads right. These are perfect for my salads and all I need is a little container for my dressing. They are dishwasher safe as well. I love these containers because they take up very little space.

"Just what I needed to hold my makeup brushes when I travel. I've always just put my brushes in a makeup bag but they get flattened and smashed. Now I can keep them separate and they will hold their shape. The holder comes apart at the middle and holds together with 2 flaps on the side that have snaps to hold it in place. The material is a plastic type that can be easily wiped down. When not being used for travel, you can use them as 2 separate holders for your brushes.

"The Bissell Trilogy is a nice vacuum for small homes with hard floors. My floors are all hardwood and tile. And this does a great job of getting into hard to reach places and getting all of the dust and dog hair that visibly accumulates. My only complaint is that it can't stand upright for storage, since it's too top-heavy. But the power and suction are great for such a small vacuum.

"I have tried out several harnesses on my dog. For us, they are easy as she helps me put them on her. Some slip off to easily when she stops and can back out of them. This Ferplast harness seems like a sturdy, well-made harness that dogs wouldn't be able to slip out of. My only hesitation with using this is how easy it is to undo the break-away straps. I had to adjust the straps to account for her larger size. Unfortunately, it's still a bit too small - and she's only the size of a large Beagle. My biggest concern with the straps is that all it would take is for her to roll around on the ground (which she does often) and the strap could break away. The latches were that easy for me to move, with just a bit of pressure on the latch. If your dog doesn't roll, you're safe.

"This activity tracker is for those who don't want to pay for an Apple watch or Fitbit. This is a fraction of the cost. But you get what you pay for. I love that you can get the different color bands and change up the look or just use it in your pocket. The band feels a lot like an Apple watch. And it's sweat-proof. And I love that you don't have to recharge the device every night. However, past the look and feel - the function leaves something to be desired. It just doesn't work as well as other activity trackers. The steps are way off. But for someone just wanting to improve themselves each day, this would be okay.

But almost a year later, it caused a leak under my sink - which caused a mess of problems. But in researching the problem, it led back to a faulty seal with this unit.

"These foil grill/oven bags are a genius idea. They are sturdier than dealing with most foil, and in a bag shape that saves a lot of time and mess. I will always keep a stock of these (and crockpot bags) from now on just for the ease of cleaning afterwards! These bags are so convenient that they are well-worth the price. Sealed on 3 sides, these really keep in the juices and make for easy cooking of savory meats and vegetables. Loose meats and vegetables are ideal, not full-size birds or hams.

"I prefer higher end brands of makeup, but decided to try out this palate. When it arrived, pink powder was everywhere. But as I checked the blush it looked intact. Not sure why there was such a mess. The black eye liner is very chunky, definitely not a fine line if that's what you're used to. I doubt I'll use it. The lip gloss is a light pink, that I'll save to use in spring or summer. Definitely not a fall color. And the blush, while a pretty color, isn't something I'd use. I love Laura Geller baked blushes too much to use anything else. There are instructions on how to use the palate (and get a smoky eye look) on the back of the box AND an insert inside the package, which is very nice. The eye shadows themselves go on very well with a eye shadow brush (I won't use the cheap, dated applicators included), and last throughout the day just fine. And they blend well. And the highlighter is a nice bonus, though I rarely use highlighters.

"Following the events in The Return of the Jedi, the remaining leaders of the Empire conduct a secret meeting on Akiva. While the Rebel Alliance try to hunt them down. There are a few familiar characters such as Wedge and Ackbar. But for the most part, the main characters of this story are new. And there are quite a few.Aftermath is written in present tense, which takes some getting used to, but I quickly forgot about it after awhile â€“ the same with the Hunger Games trilogy. The numerous new characters were difficult to keep up with at first, making reading a bit slow. But about halfway through, the pacing picked up and the characters became easier to follow as several join forces.There has been quite a lot of blacklash for this Star Wars installment. Itâ€™s certainly not a bad Star Wars novel. If youâ€™re looking for a main character novel with Luke, Leia, and Han, pick up one of the childrenâ€™s novels released this month that will center on those characters leading up to the movie release this winter.

After watching the movie multiple times, my niece was so excited to play with this doll that she was literally squealing. The doll is Barbie-sized, with an overly-large head. But she's still pretty, tho doesn't look much like the actress who plays her. There is a great amount of detail to the flowy dress to the fun accessories. My niece loved the matching ring that she got to wear. The doll's appendages bend and contort - and even pop back into place if pulled out.

"The Mashin' Max Game is a fun game for young kids who like fast-paced games like Hungry, Hungry Hippo. My nieces and nephew enjoy it for a while, before getting too rambunctious.

"Great Series with one negative.  I am not sure why they feel the need to torture the owner of many of the cars by making them think their car is stolen, repoed, or worse.  A little hurtful ribbing goes a looooooooooooooong way.  Keep that to a minimum and all the wonderful things you do to the cars will be appreciated without all the mind tricks. I am sure most owners don't laugh about those gags themselves afterwards.  I find myself saying that's just not funny regularly.Fans of automotive shows should enjoy this series.  Incredible car restorations with a level of restoration you will rarely see anywhere else.  Foose is an excellent leader and really has his heart in the right place.  I also like the fact he pays close attention to the details of the likes of the car owners.  He tries to maintain as much of the original car as possible and design changes that improve instead of deter from the original concept.CA Luster","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZX113ZOVEIE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007O2T8D2#wasThisHelpful","R1ZX113ZOVEIE0","A1GHUN5HXMHZ89","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Leviathan was a bit of a disappointment for the critics compared to some of the high voltage super SciFi hits in the genre during the late 1970s and the mid 1980s.  Remember movies like ""Alien"" (1979), Escape From New York (1981), ""The Thing"" (1982), ""Blade Runner"" (1982), and ""Aliens"" (1986).  Some probably considered this a B movie.  I am here to say I like it, but I will admit I have a taste for anything in this genre as long as it doesn't try to be outrageously bloodthirsty or fall on it's face with horrible F/X.  Leviathan works because they borrowed a little from a couple of other movies, but they twisted it enough to keep you guessing a little.  They did a pretty good job with the confined atmosphere in the underwater mining facility and the characterizations with some well known stars as well.

"Divergent is in fact divergent.  It has elements of stories that may remind you of some other movies like The Hunger Games.  That said it is unique and engaging, and still keeps the action fan in us happy.  If you enjoy Science Fiction movies that are philosophical about a utopian society you will probably be pleased.  I found it exciting, emotional, and intelligent.  It isn't easy to combine those into a theme that doesn't seem either over the top ridiculous or mushy.  It is successful in making us see a society of people divided into five factions.  Although it seems perfect, inevitably someone gets the idea they are better for ruling the rest.  In this case the supposed intelligent lawmakers.  Was this a jab at lawyers?  The peaceful agrarians that have been the decision makers are now in danger of being overthrown by the treacherous cold and calculating leader of the lawmakers.  These lawmakers shouldn't be capable of such treachery and yet the leader somehow has convinced others like the leader of the law keepers it is for the greater good.  Now to add a twist there are those in the society that could fit in anywhere they want because they have the makings of all, but this divergence is considered a threat and so they are ostracized and are killed or forced to flee the protection of the city.  Perhaps a jab at our worldwide societies having difficulty finding rulers that have intelligence, compassion, and strength of character to stand up for everyone.  I had heard mixed things about the movie, but I'm glad I decided to rent it.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed and purchased both Hunger Games, I found this more thought provoking and I plan to add it to my library too.

"Okay, so when I first saw this product I couldn't help but think that it was not a well-conceived idea.  I asked myself, ""Who in their right mind would want a collapsible Silicone Water Bottle?""  But after using it for a few weeks I now find myself wondering how I ever lived without it!Prior to this bottle, I carried with me a used plastic water bottle, or sometimes if I was feeling fancy I'd use a thermos.  The plastic water bottle would crinkle and make tons of noise while in my bag.  The thermos was big and bulky and heavy.  Both did the job, but both were not convenient.  So in comes the Collapsible Silicone Water Bottle.  I was able to just roll it up and put it in my bag, it made no noise, was tiny, and very compact.  When I passed a water fountain, I would open it up, it would expand into the shape of a typical water bottle, and I would fill it up!  When finished, I'd just rolled it back up and put it in my bag.  Very eco-friendly as it has minimized my waste-byproducts significantly, as I was drinking bottled water previously.It is about 17oz in size, has a hooked top with a clip so you can easily clip it to your belt, or a bag or something. It has top you can unscrew to fill it via the wide opening, and also a flip one where you just squeeze the bottle to drink.  I try to minimize the contact I make with the bottle, and in doing so it keeps the bottle clean for much longer.There were no residual tastes or odors and I love having it!  I am thinking of buying several more, especially giving one to my wife to keep in her purse as she tends to lug around a water bottle right now as well, and this honestly is superior to that.  Highly recommended!DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"My wife is an amateur make-up enthusiest and likes trying new types of skin care products, make-up, and accessories. So when the opportunity to try the Premium Kabuki Cosmetic Brushes came up, she was pretty excited.  I will say, that, my was not applying Kabuki make up and was utilizing it for normal make up. She went ahead and washed them good and dried them, as this is recommended in order to minimize contamination from the factory being transferred to your skin.  Once they were dried and good as new that is when the test began. The bristles are very tightly packed giving them a very firm bristle structure, similar to a hard paint brush. This is not so much a negative, as it does give you a different type of brush to add to your arsenal.  I have never applied Kabuki make up, but I am guessing this might do the job quite well, as I think it could be well suited for thick applications.  The bristles although firm, are soft. Overall, they are a very good brush set for the price and when compared to others within this price range, are a higher quality.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have multiple lanterns, and so far, this one is my favorite!  This thing looks amazing, like something straight out of a SCI-FI Movie!  Honestly, you could strap this to your arm and just use it for cosplay as it looks like some futuristic alien power generator or weapon!  This is really a cool looking lantern!With that said, the lantern itself is actually pretty well made and doesn't feel cheap.  It has some weight to it and feels solid.  In order to activate the light you just pull up on the handle and it smoothly slides open to reveal the light.  It is very bright and plenty to illuminate your immediate surroundings.  I have a couple of lanterns that are brighter, but not in this price range, let alone all the extra features!This lamp has six tiny LEDs that combine to reflect off the polished reflector. The outer surface is made of plastic, but it has a faux brass look to it, again, great for SteamPunk Cosplay perhaps?  It has three AAA rechargeable batteries included and is charged via an included cable, which is short and proprietary but it works. There is also a USB port that turns the lantern into a portable power bank, giving the ability to charge other devices.I did test the built in solar charging and after leaving it out on my southern facing deck for an entire day, I believe it was able to trickle charge a good amount, as it went from being near dead, to producing a bright light.  I will have to deplete the battery, leave it out on a clear sunny day and then time how much charge it has.Overall, it is great quality, has great features, and is definitely a great value given the quality of the light and just how versatile this device is!

"I am relatively new to coffee grinders, but I can't imagine them getting much better than the Idson Ceramic Burr Manual Coffee Grinder.  At first I was a little confused, as it was made out of brushed stainless steel, but a little research showed that the actual grinding mechanism consists of a ceramic which is very durable.  I did try it out and it produced a pretty fine grind that was similar to what you'd see in the stores.  You can only make a little at a time, and I estimate that it took about 5 minutes to make enough for a cup of coffee. The quality is superb and for the price I am absolutely blown away, again, I am not an expert on these grinders but it feels to be very high quality and worked absolutely flawlessly!  I highly recommend this unit if you're really into grinding your own coffee.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have used many sleep masks in my life, some are those cheap cloth ones, others such as the MindFold, which completely blocks out light and allow you to open your eyes completely and see nothing, pitch blackness.  Given my experience with eye masks I was anxious to try this one.The mask is very comfortable, and has a padded area that feels good.  It also seems to work well in being breathable keeping you from getting hot or sweaty.  The elastic is easily adjusted and comfortable, I could see sleeping with this without issue.I do have a large face and my nose is not very large, so the issue I was having is that you can look straight down and still see light.  So if you're looking for a mask to completely block out light and you have a smaller nose this may not be the one for you.  That is honestly the only flaw, but unfortunately that is the major purpose of a sleep mask, to block out light, while being comfortable and not putting pressure on the eyes.Overall, if you're looking for a mask to block out 100% of light and you have a smaller nose this probably isn't for you.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I tried the Aprince Suction Cup Soap Dish (Style 2), the Aprince Suction Cup Hook Holder (Style 1), and also the Aprince Suction Cup Paper Holder (Style 3). Unfortunately I am unable to provide separate reviews for the items, so they will be combined in this single one.Aprince Suction Cup Hook Holder (Style 1)I was looking for suction cups to hold a net in the bath tub for my son's toys.  The suction cups that came with it were not strong enough and would constantly fall.  So I installed these to hold up the rather large net and it has held up for many weeks now and has not lost any suction!  The bath tub is a plastic one, not tile, and I did clean the area well and dried it prior to apply the suction cups.  In all, it seems to be able to easily hold a ton of wet toys, probably weighing close to 20 lbs without any issues.  As for the look, it looks great, and honestly, if you don't look closely, it almost appears to be a permanently mounted hook.  It seemed to work best on glass or super smooth surfaces.The quality of the hooks is very good, they are a chrome-plated plastic with some stainless steel elements.  This is good because the plastic will be resistant to corrosion in moist environments like in a shower.  The actual hooks swivel inside the mount as well. My favorite feature is the red ring on the button that notifies you if it is losing suction. The literature states it can hold up to 30KG for a short period of time!  Not sure how long that is, but so far I've had it easily hold 20 lbs without issue.Overall, I highly recommend it, as this is probably the most durable, well made suction hook I have ever used, and for the money you get a set of two of them!Aprince Suction Cup Soap Dish (Style 2)I have had an issue in my shower where the soap will get all soggy and fall apart from the built in soap holder. It did not have proper drainage or air circulation so I knew I had to find a new solution as I was wasting so many bars of soap!I ran across the Aprince Suction Cup Soap Dish Holder and it looked to be exactly what I was looking for!  I received one soap holder, and the quality was incredible, very heavy duty stainless steel, it felt almost commercial. I thoroughly cleaned an area within my shower, and pushed it on to suction it.  The suction cup itself is great, it has a red edge to the suction button, so if you see red start appearing it means the soap dish is losing the suction.  I have had my suctioned to my shower wall for several weeks now and it is still as strong as the day I first placed it!  The design allows air to circulate and for the bar of soap to dry completely!  I honestly think this thing would easily pay for itself as we've noticed our bars of soap lasting much much longer!Aprince Suction Cup Paper Holder (Style 3)This was similar to the other items.  Had a great vacuum, as the suction has held for weeks and not weakened at all!  It is stainless steel, high quality, and held my toilet paper roll exactly as it should!  Highly Recommended!DISCLAIMER: I was provided a discounted or sample unit by the company.

"I love Star Trek, although I wouldn't consider myself a ""Trekkie"" but I have seen all the TV shows, well, except for DS9, have not gotten around to that, but hopefully will some day soon! When I was given the opportunity to own a pair of Star Trek Cuff Links I figured, why not!?The cuff links arrived in a little plastic baggie stuck inside a black jewelry box.  So if you're buying this as a gift I would recommend opening it up, and putting the cuff links properly into the jewelry box for proper presentation.  Honestly, that is the only real negative here, the fact that they didn't go the extra step to place these in the box properly.  But to be fair to them, this probably saves a ton of money, which they have obviously passed on to the consumer, as the price is incredible for the quality, especially with it being Star Trek related, as that tends to always command a premium.The actual link itself is about an inch long, and the Starfleet Logo is painted on metal.  The paint looks durable, but I have not worn it enough to see how much abuse they can withstand.  But honestly, how often are you going to wear them?  Unless you're an executive that is in a suit, daily, you probably will only wear these a few times per year on special occasions. The fact that the logo is black and white is great as it means it will essentially match anything you pair it with. They are also light and are not noticeable at all when wearing them.Overall, a high quality great product that I would recommend as a gift for any Trekkie in your life.  Besides the need to properly unpack and present prior to gifting, and maybe the paint job being not as detailed as I'd like, it is a great gift!  And really, no one is going to notice it unless they are literally several inches from it, and if they are that close to your wrists then, well, they are probably a close friend, and probably aren't going to be a jerk and call you out on petty details such as that.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I was actually in the market for a portable sewing kit and was happy when I was given the opportunity to try this one out!  I will be honest, I don't know much about sewing kits, nor am I very good at sewing, but it is always good to have a kid like this around in case you need to fix a tear or reattach a button!The sewing kit comes in a little plastic bag, and the actual sewing components are in a stiff zippered holder. It has a pair of tiny scissors, some needles, buttons, a safety pin, a seam ripper, threaders, measuring tape, as well as some assorted threads.  It really has everything needed for an emergency.I did go by Wal-Mart after getting the kit to see how much all this would cost separately, and I was surprised to see just how cheap sewing supplies are!  I priced out everything, as if I was going to build my own kit and it was about half the price of this particular kit.  But to be fair, I still did not have a zippered organizer case, and the amount of time I spent picking out all the items, then to pay for each item, then to go home and organize it, well, it takes time.  So what you're paying for here is a sewing kit, with the necessary things you need, already assembled into a convenient carrying case. That is what you're paying the premium for. As for the actual case itself, it seems to hold the items pretty well, I have had a few come loose inside, but with the case being zippered I have not actually lost anything.Overall, this is a decent quality kit, that takes all of the work out of buying and organizing the components yourself.  It is great for travel and I keep it in my laptop bag so that if I have any emergencies between meetings I can easily mend my clothing. Honestly, the kit is great and overall functional, but isn't something super impressive or mind blowing.  It gets the job done and that is what you're paying for.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I actually own half a dozen headlamps, I love them and use them often.  I mean think about it, when you're outside in the dark it is a good idea to have your hands free.  Why hold a flashlight that you have to point in the direction you're looking, when you can just have one strapped to your head that automatically does it for you?  And most of the time when you are in a dark place with a flashlight you're there for a reason, typically to fix or retrieve something, and it is pretty darn convenient to have both of your hands free. So that is why I switched from handhelds to headlamps years ago, as it just doesn't make sense to have a hand held flashlight in most circumstances.The headlamp contains a standard elastic band that you can easily adjust to fit your head size. It has 3 different positions allowing you to point it at exactly the direction you'd like. It also has a bright white led and also a red one as well. The build quality is pretty good and it is supposedly water resistant although I did not test that out.  The design itself isn't anything fancy but it is built well to withstand abuse and I can see it lasting through a lot of it. The headlamp runs on three AAA batteries and is easily replaced and securely locked.Overall, compared to other headlamps, this one ranks near the top!  Yes, there are better ones, brighter ones, and more durable ones, BUT they also cost significantly more than this one, and for the value, it honestly isn't worth it to upgrade past something with this quality and in this price range.  I have a $90 headlamp that is only slightly better, for that price I could almost buy 4 of these!  So I could break this headlamp through severe abuse, several times, and still come out ahead!  Great Quality, Extremely Bright, Highly Recommended!DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"So I tend to help out at my local elementary school's fall and spring festivals, and they always have a face painting booth setup.  They tend to use just the normal paint brushes you'd find at Wal-Mart and while they work okay, they are not made for face painting.  When I ran across these, I noticed they were not much more expensive and were specifically designed for the task.These are synthetic brushes, and seem to paint onto skin so very smoothly that it is almost a comfortable relaxing experience. The various brush sizes help you to easily paint whatever you'd like from thick strokes to thin lines, it works VERY well.  I did not experience the bristles falling out, which is a huge plus as cheaper alternatives tended to leave bits of brush in the paint which necessitated picking them out which tended to ruin the paint job, so this is a huge plus and a testament to teh quality of the brushes.Overall, after using a variety of brushes for face painting over the years, most of them cheapos, I will say this is a huge upgrade and definitely worth the slightly premium price over dollar store ones.  It made a huge difference and drastically improved the quality of the face painting at the carnival!!!DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have many cables, many cables... This is one of many... My collection has given me experience in knowing good from bad, right from wrong.  And this cable does what it was made to do well, it just works, and has not failed me yet!The build quality is actually better than I expected.  It arrived not in a box, but in a baggie, so it isn't exactly gift quality, but that is fine, I'd rather pay less for a cable than to pay more just to have a pretty box.The Cable is MFi Certified by Apple so you know you're getting a cable of a certain acceptable quality and performance.  The cable does not get hot, and it just works, charging my iPhone and iPad Air without issue, quickly, and transferring data without any errors.  It is actually nearly identical looking to the official Apple iOS Cable, not exact, but close.I have owned other FENIX products previously and they have never disappointed me.  They also take care of their customers so if you have any issues just contact them and they will make it right.  This cable comes with a 2 year warranty and I doubt you will have to use it, they tend to make it right the first time around.Overall, this is a great value!  I love the way it is constructed and with it being certified I can trust that it won't burn the house down!DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have many bluetooth headphones, and several of the neck style ones, including the LG Tone, which these actually look very similar to. The Bastex Bluetooth headphones actually are a pretty good value given the features.  It functions very similar to the LG Tone.  Call quality was good, as well as microphone quality. Again, this is significantly cheaper than the LG Tone, and although it was not as good, it was good enough given the price.These use Bluetooth v4 which gives better connection quality as well as improved battery life. The headphones include a Micro USB cable and it came in a baggie, so it is not in a packaging state to be gifted unfortunately.  If there was a nice box it would have improve the presentation but at this price, I am sure they figured they woudl rather pass the packaging savings on to the customer instead of charging us for a prettier box, which is understandable.All the controls seem to be on the left side fo the device, and it only takes a few minutes to learn how to use them by feeling around and experimenting. The micro usb charging port has a cover over it to help keep out dust and debris, and although this felt flimsy it seemed to stay in place when pushed back in. The magnetic headphone holders worked well although they did nto hold the headphone earbuds as well as the LG Tone.  It typically took multiple tries to get both headphones held in place by the magnets. The wire is plenty long enough and the slack can be adjusted.I was able to easily pair this with an iPhone 6 and also an Amazon Fire Phone without issue, as well as a random Bluetooth dongle I had lying around.  Sound quality was pretty good, actually slightly better than expected but not as good as the LG Tone.  Microphone quality was good as well and callers said I sounded fine although occasionally muffled or low. Battery life isn't so bad either I've used it for 8 hours without issue, when charging it glows red and shuts off when done.The build quality feels durable, although the plastic doesn't feel as solid as the LG Tone.  I do feel it will hold up just fine though and the lighter plastic does help give it a weighless feel when wearing it around the neck.Overall, for the price it is a really good value.  The sound quality and microphone quality aren't the best, but they are very mangeable and work well given the price.  At the cost you could easily buy several of these over the price of a single LG Tone, so if you are prone to losing things that might be a better option.  There are better neck headphones out there, but not at this pricepoint.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I tend to the gym a few days a week, struggling to get into shape and lose some weight.  It is all about changing your lifestyle and you do that by implementing new habits.  I tend to run on the treadmill (well, more like occasionally jog in between walking fast) and I was putting my phone in the cup holder of the exercise equipment, which more times than I'd like to admit, caused me to forget my phone.  I was looking for a solution to keep it on me, as it wasn't practical to put it in my pocket as it would weigh down my work out shorts and be uncomfortable.  I tried one of those arm straps and it didn't work very well.  I then tried the GioSport Running Belt and have been pleasantly impressed.The belt expanded to fit my large waste without issue and was very comfortable.  It has two zippered pockets, which I was able to put my ID card in, my phone, and keys.  My wallet was a tad snug and I decided to just leave it in the locker as there was no reason to lug it along. There is an earphone hole but I did not have to use it since I was using Bluetooth headphones, but this is a great option if you have wired headphones.The actual quality of the belt is also very good, it has a slightly stretchy material and the zippers work smoothly.  I did not see any frayed stitching and I feel that this should hold up nicely.  Overall, I am impressed and so far have been enjoying it!DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have been a watch fanatic for years and I have owned many different types of watches and bands available.  I own several Omega Watches, Rolex Watches, a Breitling, and a Tag Heuer.  I also own a Seiko, a Citizen, and my previous daily work watch (Before the Apple Watch), which is a Casio G-Shock.  Overall, what I was trying to say here is that I know watches, and I know watch bands.  So when I received this watch band for my Apple Watch, I will say, that I was impressed!So I said I was impressed, yes, by the watch band itself, but the box?  Well, that left much to be desired.  It comes shrink wrapped in a box, not a watch box or velvet lined presentation case, but just a cardboard box. This is fine, as it gets it to you in one piece without flaws, but if you are thinking of gifting this to someone I would probably suggest heading over to a local jewelry store and possibly obtaining a box for a few dollars.  But honestly, I don't think most folks will care, as they will forget about the cardboard box the minute they lay eyes on the watch band itself!The watch bracelet is very high quality.  It appears to be a stainless steel with a wonderful finish that reminded me a lot of the Rolex and Breitling!  It does have some weight to it, which I love, but if you're looking for a light wristband then I would definitely not suggest this.  The quality is there, and with the quality of the metal comes with it weight. The clasp itself works precisely and locks the watch onto your wrist, not releasing until the buttons are properly actuated.  This is very similar to my Tag Heuer and Omega Watches.  Again, the quality of this band rivals those!The included watch band tools are also a great touch!  To be honest, the tools themselves are typical cheap tools, like ones you'd find on eBay or a discount watch website. They work, and work well, but they are not durable, as I have owned similar ones previously and they will work for a few dozen uses before finally cracking.  But they are fine for this, as how many times are you going to remove your watch band anyways?  Probably never if you put this one on, as it is REALLY good.  And once you size it up and remove the links you're good to go.The tempered glass screen protector and clear bezel cover were great additions and they worked and looked great!Overall, this is worth the money, as I have spent far more on watch bands that were not even close to the quality of this one!  In my opinion, it is even better than the official Apple watch band, and at the price difference, is is most definitely worth it!  Even if the watch band somehow broke, you could replace it many times before costing the same amount as the Apple one.  If you're looking for a stainless steel band, then this is it!DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have reviewed other beard balms and beard oils in the past, so I am definitely no stranger to such products.  When I received this product I was impressed that it was packaged, sealed in a bubble wrap pocket, and the bottle of oil was also inside a nice little canvas like bag.  It gave it a very fancy, nice presentation.  It also came with the tiniest little bottle you've ever seen, which was empty, but I assume is meant to put a little bit of oil in to take along with you as it is just enough for a very light application to a moderate beard.I will say that this beard oil smells very good, slightly minty but still very masculine, although the aroma is not very strong. When applied, it conditioned the beard, softening it and making it look and feel great. The skin in, around and underneath did not feel oily either, but keep in mind you have to apply this lightly and not soak your beard. I would honestly use the included tiny bottle as a guide to how much to use in a single application. The oil also seemed to help with the scratchy feeling and made the beard feel more comfortable on the face.  It also seems to have tamed the frizziness, making it appear much less scruffy.Overall, the product quality is high, the package presentation is at a level that it can easily be gifted that way, and the oil itself is great, non-irritating and helps soften and tame the beard while conditioning it.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I LOVE SHOWER HEADS!  They can make shower time fun, or they can make it dull, as it is all in the presentation and feel of the water.  The KFL08B 8"" Modern Round Shower Head caught my interest and I just had to give it a try!The actual shower head itself is made out of a high quality stainless steel that seems to resist water spots pretty well.  The stainless steel should offer up protection against corrosion over the years and the build quality is very durable.  The silicone rubber nozzles are also great and they help to minimize mineral build up over time.  If you ever do have a nozzle not functioning as designed you just have to massage it a little to break up the minerals and it will again work good as new.  The actual look is interesting, as it is 8"" across and very thin, it does have a very modern feel to it.I had originally installed it at an angle, to see how it would work.  It actually worked really well and produced a powerful flow.  I then installed it directly overhead and I honestly liked it better that way, as it did give it a strong rainfall effect and felt better.  Again, slightly better overhead, but worked great at an angle, so don't be afraid of that.  The water pressure was consistent across the nozzles and it actually seemed to have increased my water pressure.This particular showerhead does not have any adjustment controls, but personally when I am in the shower I just want an enjoyable experience without too much thought or effort.  I just want it to work, especially since most of the time I am still have asleep so trying to fiddle with adjustments is not something I want to do in the mornings.  I have owned numerous adjustable shower heads and honestly, after the first few days you tend to never touch the adjustments again.  It just becomes too much effort.  So I don't think it is a major loss, especially with this shower head, as it just works, and it works well.As for water useage, this did use more than my previous shower head, but it was not as significant as some of the larger rainfall heads.  I wil say though, this is definitely not a water-saver model, but it isn't too wasteful either.  It is a good balance and we still had hot water left over (50 gallon gas heater) after using it for 2 showers over the course of 35 minutes.Overall, I love the design, I love the quality, and I love the wide even spread of the water.  The stainless steel mirror chrome finish looks great and the rubber silicone nozzles compliment it well.  The super thin design is also eye catching, as most shower heads are really fat, but this one, it is thin and beautiful!DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have a 4 year old, and of course, he needs a gazillion toys to be with him while he is in the bath tub.  We already have several other organizers, so why not another one!?We have loaded it up and it seems to hold very well, as especially when the toys are wet the weight is somewhat substantial.  The suction cups have held without issue.  I will say though that prior to sticking them to the bath tub I was sure to clean the area very well to make sure there would be no issues with residue weakening the suction.The size is average, I wish it was just a little bigger, but it was plenty of room to hold pretty much any toy a kid could bring to the tub.  The included hooks also worked great and provided a lot of holding power.  The mesh design was also good as it allowed air to circulate and dry the toys as well.I will say though, it is a little expensive for what you get, but that tends to be common when looking for bath related items.  The product itself is very light and comes in a small box, but don't let that fool you, it is a good product, but again, to me it just feels slightly pricey given the size and flimsy box.Overall, it is a good product and if you need a mesh bag to organize and dry toys or other bath items this is a very good option.  We've had it up for several week and even with the toddler tugging on it, it still has not fallen into the water.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have purchased many hose adapter nozzles over the years, some from Wal-Mart, some from Lowes, and some from the Dollar Store.  They tend to work great at first but over time start to have issues, leaking everywhere, before eventually breaking.  Due to this I have been on the look out, constantly, for a better option.I was given the opportunity to give this nozzle a try, and being skeptical I figured it would work great for a day or two before being completely damaged.  I hooked it up to my hose, and began going through the different settings.  It has the following settings:CONEJETCENTERMISTSHOWERRINSEFLATSOAKERYes, 8 settings, I have no idea how they were able to fit so many in such a small package, but I have never had one with this many.  Each of the settings worked great, the only one I feel should have been lsightly better was the SOAKER, as it just seems to dribble/pour out at a low pressure, but I suppose that might be the point, to just soak something.The handle itself is plastic, while the nozzle part is metal, and the adjustment ring is plastic.  It has a good weight to it and feel pretty heavy duty and not like the cheap dollar store ones. The handle is slip resistant and comfortable to hold. One of my favorite feature is a little clip that will keep the hose on, spraying, without you even holding it.  It also has two washers for you to install if need be into the spray nozzle and your hose if you need.The one issue I have noticed was that the paint on the metal part seems to chip easily.  This is more a cosmetic issue and it has not impacted the actual function of the device.  The nozzle has been dropped numerous times, and I have let my 4 year old son play with it and trust me, he was not gentle, and it still works like new!  It has passed the toddler test!Overall, this is a premium hose nozzle, and it is somewhat pricey compared to other options available at your local stores. But I do honestly feel that this one might last quite a bit longer.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have always felt that cables, large and small, expensive and cheap, tend to be similar in quality and design. What does matter is when a cable is certified, and in this case, the Amroke Lightning to USB cable is MFi Certified by Apple computers, which attests that it has passed their quality standards.  With that, you are being reassured that the cable won't be a complete gamble and will charge and transmit data precisely.I have used the cable for several weeks now and have noticed no issues.  It has performed flawlessly and worked without problem.  I will say though that I do not jerk the cable around, nor did I manhandle them.  The cable is used in my vehicle and I tend to just plut it in when using the GPS app on my phone or iPad.Overall, for the price, it is within the prices of many other cables.  I feel it is a good value and cheap enough to warrant buying several to have available to you.  The quality was great and it just worked.  I think the biggest selling point though is the warranty, as the manufacturer provides a lifetime warranty and they truly seem to want you to be happy with the product.  Most of the other cables in this price range tend to have very limited warranties, but not the Amroke. There are cheaper cables, but none at this quality and warranty.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have reviewed a lot of Bluetooth headphones, and I will be honest, when I opened this up I was a little taken aback by the size and design.  They are somewhat larger then others out there, and didn't exactly look as fashionable as other, more expensive options.  But honestly it isn't much larger and for the price, if it works, it would still be a great value.One I put them on, the DBPOWER BE-900 HIFI Bluetooth headphones actually looked pretty good.  They are black in color and finish and have a stiff wire that connects the two pieces which goes behind your head. The box also has several different sized ear pieces to help customize your fit. The instructions suggest charging them for at least 6 hours, but I went ahead and just left them overnight. It did come with a micro USB Connector to charge with, but honestly, it will work with any micro USB cable, as they are everywhere these days.This synched via Bluetooth on several different devices without issue.  I connected it to my iPad, iPhone, and Amazon Fire Phone without any problems. All I did was hold teh power button until it began flashing red and blue, and then found the headphones on my device.  The buttons on the headphones can skip songs, or adjust the volume.The fit was not as snug, so there was some exterior noise invading the music, but they did stay on my ears.  Honestly though, I liked the fact that I could still hear what was going around me somewhat while listing to music.  I am unsure how much the noise canceling made a difference, as it just seemed to change the audio a bit, but at this price point, I didn't expect much as most headphones with that feature tend to cost much more.Overall these are great headphones for working out.  The sound is pretty good, I'd say better than average, and it fits tightly onto your head so they stay in place.  They are a little large, but no one will care, and honestly they look fine.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"This beard Balm smells great!  It also gives a cooling sensation on the skin. I would dab a little in the morning after I got out of the shower, just rubbing it in with my hands.It helps the beard become softer and easier to manage.  It also does not leave a greasy oily residue. Overall it really did smooth out my beard. It really makes the beard feel comfortable on  your face.

"After utilizing this product for approximately 30 days I have to say that it really does work.  It makes the beard look much better, more well kept, and eliminated a lot of the frizziness. It conditions it well providing a very soft feel to it, reducing prickliness significantly. It also smells wonderful.The amount you get in the bottle, although it looks insignificant, is quite a bit at 4oz.  A little goes a long way I can easily see this lasting a month or more with daily use. The pump dispenses just the right amount for the average beard. You basically just rub it into the beard and leave it in, no need to wash it out.The one negative is that it seemed to slightly darken my beard, which isn't a huge deal, as the benefits of it being soft and luxurious far outweigh the slight color change.  I have gotten use to it, but I did remove 1 star as this should be made clear to folks as some people don't want to change the color of their beard.DISCLAIMER: I was provided a sample unit by the company.

"I have a lot of car chargers for my various devices. The kitbest Car Charger is actually very good quality and feels durable. The USB ports were a little snug but I don't see it breaking down anytime soon.  There is a little LED light that indicates power charging and is faint enough to not be distracting during night driving. The ports are very close together so any USB cords you use will not have to have a bunch of extra plastic around the plugs themselves otherwise it may not fit well.It contains four ports, there are a couple of 1AMP ports and a couple of 2AMP ports. The charger did not come with any cords and is the actual charger plug itself. It is very small and easy to take with you anywhere, I actually bought 2, one I keep in my car and the other I keep in my backpack in case it is needed while traveling with friends or family.I was able to charge my iPad Air, my Amazon Fire Phone, my iPhone 6, and a Samsung Infuse.  I also plugged it into my dashcam and it powered it without issue.The plug has a 1 year + 6 month warranty (18 months total) which says a lot, as the company seems very willing to stand behind their product.After reviewing this I bought another one at full price because I was so impressed by it.DISCLAIMER: I was sold a discounted sample unit by the company.

"The Marrywindix Over the Door 7 Hook Metal Rack does what it is meant to.  It hangs on the door, is approximately 17"" wide, the hooks are about 3"" apart, and it is able to hold heavy coats or other items without bending or warping.  The only adjustment I had to make was by bending the over the door part so that it formed a tight clamp to the top of the door, otherwise it would jangle and move about, although with weight on the hooks it is pretty sturdy. There are dull nubs on the ends of the hook to ensure it doesn't tear through your clothing. Overall, it is a nice item and even though the metal is very thin looking, it is strong and doesn't really look cheap.  Overall, this isn't anything fancy and honestly it feels somewhat light and ""cheap"" out of the box but it looks fantastic.

"I've only been using the headphones for a couple weeks with my Amazon Fire Phone, and my usual rule is to try a product out for at least 30 days before writing a review. In this instance, I felt compelled to at least put a cursory review up as I have been VERY impressed with these headphones. I am a casual audiophile, and I have tried many headphones, and ear-buds.  I will say that the sound isn't comparable to high end headphones but I was sufficiently impressed with the sound quality!  I could hear all the instruments, vocals, and even almost feel the bass from the mids and lows.I am very impressed with the sound!  The one, slight negative I have with the sound is that there is a slight, noticeable hiss when the volume is turned up on the actual headset.  The way to eliminate that is to just turn the volume on the headset down and turn it up on your mobile device.The one thing I kind of struggled with at the beginning is placing the ear-buds properly in my ears.  If they are slightly off the sound quality is reduced sounding quieter or even muffled.  Proper placement results in some amazing sound though.The rubber plug that covers the charging port is tough to get out, and to get in, but it fits snugly and I like that, as it does what it is meant to, protecting the actual plug.  My biggest concern with the plug though is that it is so tight that I think it might get damaged with repeated chargings.Bluetooth pairing is fast, easy, and stable, with decent range.  I don't get the loss of signal when I turn my head like I have on other units.The actual headsets are comfortable and with the included rubber pieces i was able to have it perfectly fit my ear and they stay in, no matter how much I move or work out at the gym.I think the biggest test will be how long they last, as durability seems to be one of the bigger complaints. So if there is interest I will definitely update this review with my experiences as time goes on.DISCLAIMER: I was given a sample unit by the company.

"I have had the lantern for almost 30 days now and feel that I can now offer a detailed helpful review.  So the lantern is made with a somewhat durable plastic, although it is thinner, as the light can shine through it.  This is actually somewhat good as the lantern operates as a collapsible design, working by sliding it open to reveal the clear plastic and LED bulb.  By sliding it up partially you can reduce the brightness of the light, as this is the only way to do so.  Besides that it is either ON or OFF, there are no switches.The lantern takes three AA batteries and has thin metal handles, which aren't exactly comfortable nor meant for carrying the lantern for long periods of time. If you hang this lantern up and slide it to close it, it will eventually turn itself on as gravity pulls it back open.  I am guessing it does this due to the batteries being in the bottom portion, making it heavier. So in the middle of the night you may awaken to the lantern being on and wondering if someone was in your tent... But just rest assured it was just good ole gravity.There are a lot of reviews that talk about the smell, and I will admit, there is a strong plastic like smell that the lantern gives off.  If you leave it out for several days it is severely diminished though and is no longer noticeable.THIS LANTERN IS NOT WATERPROOF.  There are way too many openings and unsealed edges to prevent water from entering into it.  If you are walking th rough light rain it should be fine as the plastic is water resistant but if it gets inside the unit then I would suggest removing the batteries and letting it air out.The actual brightness of the lantern is pretty impressive for something so cheap and so small.  The light is also a soft brightness so it isn't too harsh, although I still would not recommend looking directly into it.It also comes with a compass on the top, which seems somewhat accurate, although it sometimes gets stuck and needs to be jostled to get it pointing correctly.I guess the biggest con with this is the camouflage design, it is pretty good and if you aren't careful and are in the right kind of brush you could actually lose the lantern.Overall, it is a good lantern and I do recommend it.  I will say though that for about 50% more in price you can get a better quality, more durable, and much brighter lantern, the one I recommend is the Rayovac SE3DLNACOM Sportsman 240. I have had several and used them for many years without issue.DISCLAIMER: I was given a sample unit by the company.

"So, I have used the LG Tone previously on and off and I really did like it.  I ended up giving the LG Tone to my father and after a while realized that I missed having the Bluetooth headset hidden under my collar throughout the work day, at my ready to play music or to answer a call. When I was given the opportunity to try these out I knew I just had to share my experience with others. I tried it out for 30+ days before writing this review.The entire reason one gets this is so they can have a long battery life product that has a good microphone, good sound quality, and is discreet. The design of the GRDE Aptx Neckband Headset reminds me a lot of the LG Tone, and unless you are very close folks won't be able to really tell what you have. AS for appearance, one thing I did not like is the chromed out buttons that are shiny and visible.  The entire reason I like this style of headset is for them being discreet, and the buttons kind of distract from that.As for the build quality, the plastic does not seem to be at the same level and quality of the LG Tone, but keep in mind, the LG Tone also costs more than double. The headphones store away in these little alcoves at the end of the headset around your neck via magnets. Unfortunately, the magnets are very weak and I had a very tough time storing them away as they would keep falling out.As for the actual earpieces they fit the ears pretty well and are tolerable in regards to comfort.  I was able to wear them while working out on an elliptical for an hour without any major discomfort or issue. The sound quality was okay, it was clear and there was a little bass response, but nothing spectacular, and I say that as an audio enthusiast, so for the average user it may be okay as I was able to hear the lyrics of my music clearly, as well as phone calls without issue.  The microphone is also pretty decent, although at times I was told I sounded somewhat muffled, although the MIC itself just seems to be a tiny hole.I was able to pair this up with the Amazon Fire Phone and an iPhone 6 without any issues, both utilizing BT 4.0.  The connection was stable and I had no issues with disconnects of static when the phone was nearby.  Occasionally if the phone was in my pocket, depending on how I turned my head I would get slight static or disconnects but it was somewhat rare. Interestingly though, the actual unobstructed range for the headphones is quite good as I was able to get clear signal 30+ feet away.The headset charges via a Micro USB plug that is hidden away by a plastic cap. The cap itself is tight and very hard to remove without fear of damaging the headset.  The Micro USB Plug itself is also VERY tight and I fear that it may eventually fail due to this and the pressure that is put onto it from inserting and removing the Micro USB plug.  It also has a little on-off switch that you have to literally slide, although the unit will power off to conserve battery after being idle for a while.Overall, the headphones are tolerable and the sound quality is okay.  The build quality is durable but does not have the feel of a higher end product such as the LG Tone. For the price I feel it is a good value, although if the price were to decrease by about 25% it would be a much higher recommended purchase. Overall, if you don't want to spend the extra for the LG Tone or other similar higher end headset then I can say this is a good value.  I would just treat the headset with care, but so far, after 30+ days of near daily use it has held up and works just as good as the first day.DISCLAIMER: I was given a sample unit by the company.

"I will start this review off by saying that I consider myself an audio enthusiast and I tend to listen to a lot of different headphones.  Given that, I will say that the quality of these headphones is ""Okay"" but nothing fantastic.  They sound good, are clear, and offer slight bass response, but I felt that the sound was somewhat flat.  After fiddling around with an EQ app I was able to improve the sound a little but it is still nothing like a higher end headphone. With that said, I am not going to be reviewing this as an audiophile for audiophiles, but will be reviewing it for the broader audience who are going to use it for music or TV watching.I tried it out for a full 30 days to see how I would like it.  Over that time I noticed that for TV watching (via Bluetooth on my laptop) the sound was absolutely fine.  I was able to clearly hear dialog and the sound was clear, crisp and the bass was enough to give you a slight ""feel"" when those explosions happened or when the characters would walk into a night club or something that had thump. For Music, it was fine too and sounded good. But again, the sound doesn't really have depth to it, it is just a clear headset.So I can more accurately compare the sound quality for folks out there, I felt that it was maybe slightly less than a ""Skull Candy"" or ""Beats"" set of headphones. But keep in mind there is also a huge price difference and with these costing much less than those, it is actually a decent value for the price to sound you receive.Now on to the actual build quality. The build quality feels pretty solid, although I will say that it felt Overly padded at the top that goes on your head which made the headphones sit a little strangely on my head and ears. The material used to create the soft padding also felt cheaper and did not ""mold"" to your head as well as some other headphones, which led to there being some slight sound leakage depending on how your head was positioned. There are rubber covers that protect the recharge port, but on my particular headphones the cover did not cover and would just dangle open, no matter what I did I could not get the cover to stay on. The LED light is also a little bright if you're going to be using them in the dark.As for the battery life, it was pretty good and I got several days of heavy use before it needed a recharge. If I were to calculate it in hours I think around 8-12 hours.The Microphone worked, but it was comparable to a common (not high end) Bluetooth earpiece.The included 3.5mm stereo cable worked fine and is a flat cable design so it doesn't tangle as easily.  The recharge cable plugs into a computer to recharge, as there is no wall adapter included. The carrying bag is just a fabric bag that offers protection only from scratches.I have a very large head, and these headphones at their max adjustment still did not fit it properly and felt uncomfortable to me.The biggest negative of this device to me is the price compared to what you get.  Yes these are Bluetooth headphones, and the quality is comparable to lower end over the ear headphones with sound quality a little less than SkullCandy and a little bit more less than Beats. So for the price it it selling for right now I would probably recommend spending a little more to get a better set of headphones, but that could just be the audiophile in me speaking. But if you're unable to do that, I honestly would not have a problem recommending these, although I still feel that the price should probably be about 30% cheaper.DISCLAIMER: I was given a sample unit by the company.

"I actually had a bug problem in my garage and was looking for a less poisonous solution to my problem. I went ahead and plugged this up to an outlet in my garage and also set out numerous glue traps to test how many bugs they caught.  Previously the glue traps consistently caught many many bugs so I knew that if there was a decrease I could tell by the glue traps.Upon receiving the product I noticed the box itself was not of the highest quality and was somewhat smashed due to the thin cardboard.  The actual unit itself is made of plastic, and is not super durable feeling but it is probably good enough for the applications as it is meant to be plugged in and not handled constantly.So I picked the spot in the room that would broadcast the ultrasonic waves efficiently to cover the entire garage. One thing I did notice upon plugging it in is that you could hear a very slight high pitched sound, not very obvious but if it is VERY quiet and you hold your breath it is there.  For me, being extremely acoustosensitive the device made me nauseous ans slightly dizzy after a few minutes so I had to leave the garage.One thing I noticed is that if I have the garage open now, the neighbor's dog begins barking which I am guessing means that it is audible to animals, so if you have a pet I would definitely recommend you only use this in an area that your pet will not be exposed to.  I will also say that my neighbor's pet was a good 50 ft from my garage so this device must be pretty loud at those ultrasonic frequencies!So, after having plugged it in and let it run for nearly 60 days and checking the glue traps weekly, I did notice a decrease in bugs.  I actually counted how many were in each glue trap and compared to before the device, it seemed to decrease the amount of bugs by a few percentage points per week.  By the end of 60 days I was only catching about 25% of the bugs I use to, so that is a 75% decrease!To be fair though, this could just be coincidence, and due to possibly the weather getting warming and the bugs leaving the house, I don't know as I do not have any data to compare it to last year around this time.The one CON I have here though, is that the feature that sends a signal throughout your entire house via the electrical circuitry was tough to test. As there was no way for me to isolate a particular room to see if it helped or hurt it.  I also was not sure how the signal would flow through the various junctions and breakers. I will say though that when I enabled it I seemed to have some slight WiFi / Internet issues but I can't be sure if it was caused by this device completely or not.Overall, I feel it did decrease the bug count in the immediate area that it was used for, but I can't say for sure if it helped anywhere else.  Pets can also hear it and might be annoying to them.  The Blue Light on it is somewhat bright for a night light, but works great if you need a light to illuminate a hallway.DISCLAIMER: I was given a sample unit by the company.

"I have not tried a Glucosamine Supplement before so I was anxious to give the Viva Labs Glucosamine Chondroitin combination a try.  I dove into the research and discovered that this particular supplement is designed to help relieve your joint pain, improve skin health, and remove toxins as well as help repair cartilage. Diving into a bunch of clinical studies I found many that showed improve of subjects, and also many that showed it was no better than a placebo.  With the scientific studies being divided I figured the best thing to do was to give it a good try.I compared this to a lot of other products you'd find at Wal-Mart and other online and it seems this product may be slightly less potent per pill than other offerings, but if you calculate the price vs dose ratio it isn't actually much more expensive. I also feel that the capsules allow for better absorption than those solid pills.I gave this particular supplement a minimum of 30 days to ensure it was given plenty of time.  I have back joint issues, knee issues, hip issues, wrist and shoulder issues, etc.  So I knew if it worked I would at least know from one of these improving.A lot of places suggested to take a ""higher starting dose"" for the first couple of weeks to help build up the body's levels of the supplement.  So I took a daily double dose for those two weeks, and then a normal recommended dose the remaining 2 weeks.  The pills themselves were fine and I had no issues, they were slightly big but nothing too difficult to swallow.I honestly did not notice significant improvement until well into the third week. I was getting out of bed and going about my day without even noticing any pain, when previously I acknowledged the pain constantly as it was hard to ignore.  By the end of the fourth week I feel that there was a 75% reduction in joint paint throughout my entire body.  I look forward to trying it longer to seeing if there is additional improvement.DISCLAIMER: I was given a sample unit by the company.

"Over the years I have had the opportunity to try various wine pourers. I will say that this one pours the cleanest out of all of the ones I have tried previously, as it cleanly combines two streams into a single one before it pours from the bottle. The pour is easily controlled and very precise and it seems to aerate it perfectly.Now I have not tried a Chilling stick before, but I did follow the instructions, placing it in the freezer for several hours.  I did notice that the wine was cooler, but not overly cold.  I did not do an official measurement but it did not seem to cool it to optimum wine drinking temperature.  I would suggest that this would be good to use with an already chilled bottle of wine, as it did not seem as effective on a bottle that is at room temperature. Again, it did cool it, but did not get it to the level to adequately enjoy the wine. If it is already chilled then I feel it would help keep it chilled longer.The Packaging of the item is also superb and gives it a very high-class feel, as it definitely does not look cheap. It would make for an impressive gift as friends, family, and clients would be sure to appreciate the look and feel of the Cucina Casa Wine Chiller.I am giving it 4 stars, as the chilling feature is somewhat lacking, but the quality, pouring, and aeration are superb.DISCLAIMER: I was offered one at a discount by the company.

"So, I've been using these toothbrushes for over 3 years now.  When they first were introduced I bought one for myself, one for my wife, and one for my parents to share.  So in all, I have experience with 2 in my household and second hand experience from my parents.  My Father-In-Law also bought one as well and had a similar experience as ours.With that said, this toothbrush is incredible!  It cleans better than any electric toothbrush available.  I love the different settings and programs it offers. It is also extremely stylish and looks like it is from the future. I have gone to the dentist and been told that there really isn't anything for them to do as I didn't have much to clean at all.  The convenience it offers when charging is also incredible as all you do is plop it into the base or put it into the cup and it charges without plugging anything into it.  The travel case is also incredible and works perfectly, you just plug in the usb cable and it charges just like how a cell phone would. Overall this toothbrush is everything I was looking for in a toothbrush!  With that said, I have to go into detail with the issue we have all had with the Sonicare Diamondclean handles.The battery holds a great charge and is not an issue.  The function when it works is excellent!  The accessories are great!  But there is some fatal flaw in the design of this toothbrush that makes it extremely fragile.  Something inside comes ""unglued"" and the vibration delivered to the brush head is reduced by 90%, but you can feel the mechanism inside the handle vibrating and making strange noises.  This will occur if you drop it, EVEN ONCE.  I had this happen on my first brush, it slipped out of my hands (As it is a very sleek design) and fell into the sink and it was broken.  I contacted Sonicare and was told that dropping it voids the warranty and there was nothing they would do about it as it is considered abuse.  The fact that it was dropped from about 1 ft into my sink, ONCE, was not of concern to them.  After speaking with several supervisors they sent me a replacement as a one-time customer goodwill.  From this point on I was incredibly paranoid using it, gripping the handle until my fingers turned white for fear of dropping it and destroying another one.  I also briefed my wife on it as well as my parents, telling them that they better not drop it as it would void the warranty and even a little drop would break it.Things went well for a while, until about 14 months after the replacement, the same issue that occurred after dropping it, was happening again, but I had NEVER dropped it and have actually handled it with such care due to the trauma of my original experience with Sonicare Customer Service.  The mechanism had again somehow disengaged partially, reducing the vibration by 90% and making the Sonicare more of a normal toothbrush with a vibrating handle.  I contacted Sonicare, and after adamantly denying that I dropped it, they finally authorized a replacement, thank goodness for the 2 year warranty.  Mine lasted about 10 more months and it again, had the same issue and had never been dropped.  I contacted Sonicare and was told that I was a couple of months past the 2 year warranty and that I was out of luck.Now for my wife's Sonicare Diamondclean, as she experienced the same issue.  She never dropped it, and was paranoid after my experience.  After about 11 months she had to have hers replaced due the same thing I experienced.  Her second one broke after only 8 months so she got a second replacement.  It lasted about 9 months and now she is out of warranty and her THIRD Sonicare Diamondclean handle is now also broken, several months out of warranty.My parents also had a similar experience.  The first Sonicare Diamondclean handle broke after about 8 months, received replacement.  Second handle broke after 10 months, received another replacement.  The third one broke after 9 months and is now out of warranty.My Father-in-Law also purchased one of these after seeing how awesome it was during the first few months, and I told him he better not drop it.  He ended up having the same issue come up and when he tried to redeem the warranty for a replacement, because he did not have the receipt they refused to replace it.  Keep in mind, this is when the toothbrush was first released, so the thing hadn't even been out for a year yet.  Even so, they refused to give him a replacement without the receipt/proof of purchase and it took me escalating it to darn near the CEO to get his replaced.  I calmly explained to them that my Father-In-Law was NOT A TIME TRAVELER and he had not somehow traveled into the future, bought their Sonicare DiamondClean, and then traveled back in time 18 months before release of the DiamondClean.  That their product had not even been out for 1 year, let alone 2 years.  After this reasoning they replaced it and said that it was a one time exception.  Interestingly, it has been working fine since then, going on close to 20 months now, but I suspect it will fail within the next few months, and he is already out of warranty.So there you have it, 4 Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush sets, 3 of us went through multiple replacements, and all but 1 of them after 2 years are now broken.  NONE of those have been dropped, and I can personally vouch for mine and my wife's being drop free.  As for my parents, they assure me it was never dropped and that is enough for me.  I also know for a fact that my wife and I do not brush our teeth hard and we literally just let the brush head ""glide"" over the surface of our teeth applying just enough pressure for it to make contact.Overall, the toothbrush is ridiculously awesome, and when it works it is the best thing ever!  The fact that I have direct experience with 2 Sonicare Diamondcleana, and another 2 through second hand experience, and all of them break, is unsettling.  Also the fact my Father-in-Law got lucky and his replacement is still working after 20 months also shows me it could be a sporadic quality control issue.  Either that or my Father-In-Law doesn't brush his tooth as often as us.  So either we are all the unluckiest family out there, or there is some design flaw that causes the Sonicare DiamondClean's vibration mechanism to come loose inside the handle.So now I have a bunch of replacement brush heads sitting in my drawer but no toothbrushes that work with them.  We have resorted to using a normal manual toothbrush while we figure out what to buy to replace the broken DiamondClean handles, especially since our finances are not in the best place due to medical bills, and lets be honest, the Sonicare Toothbrushes are not cheap. My gosh how horrible it is to not have an electric toothbrush, as it feels like my teeth is not getting even 1/10 as clean as it was getting with the Sonicare.  It really makes you miss an electric toothbrush.On a side note, the one warning I have for people who use electric toothbrushes is to be careful brushing a tooth with a crown on it, as I have been told by my dentist that the vibration will break down the cement holding the crown in place causing it to come loose.  How did we come upon that subject?  because my crown fell out.  ;)  So careful if you have one.I do hope this review has helped you guys out and helps you make a more informed decision.  If you buy this Sonicare Diamondclean, SAVE THE RECEIPT and remember that you will probably have to get at least 1, maybe 2 replacements.  If your Sonicare Diamondclean is acting up, even a little and it sounds like the handle is beginning to rattle, get it replaced immediately.  I would highly recommend attempting to get it replaced before the 2 years is up, as that way you can at least get almost 3 years of use from the original purchase.Overall, I am giving it 2 stars as the toothbrush is incredible, the accessories are great, and it works fantastically!  I am taking away 3 stars because of the lack of reliability, although Sonicare WILL replace the broken handles IF you have your receipt and it is within the 2 year window. As I said, just realize you are paying for the privilege of using the Sonicare DiamondClean for at least 2 years, anything past that is a bonus. It may not be the original one you bought, but Sonicare will ensure you get a replacement as long as you are within the warranty period.  Also, their customer service is not the most friendly and they will try to trick you into admitting fault so they can immediately deny a replacement and void your warranty. They also require a receipt regardless if you registered your product, as I said, they basically accused my Father-in-Law of being a Time Traveler, trying to deny the warranty when the toothbrush had been out for less than a year.So now you know the risks and perils involved with entering into the transaction of obtaining a Sonicare DiamondClean.  Farewell and stay vigilant, as it is a great toothbrush, but you are going to have to fight for your right to brush with it...","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZZATMTHPN2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052JN7XG#wasThisHelpful","R34ZZATMTHPN2A","A2USRFOMNH7CGI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2USRFOMNH7CGI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am currently in the market for a new shower head and due to this I have seen a lot of them at my local hardware stores. I will say that the quality of this feels VERY high.  It is made out of plastic, but it does not flex or bend easily nor does it feel cheap at all.  I will say that in my search for a shower head that most new ones are made out of a similar plastic, even ones many times more expensive than this one.The installation was VERY easy, I just unscrewed the old shower head, and screwed this one on.  I didn't even have to use a tool and it took all of 2 minutes from start to finish. The metal part is precisely machined and it fit snugly without any bit of wobble, due to this you have to get it lined up PERFECTLY in order for it to screw on, which I loved!  I did not even use the included Teflon Tape and it has not leaked at all.As for the experience, it was wonderful!  It does not provide a ""Downpour"" like experience like some of those rain shower heads which use A LOT of water (upwards of 3gpm) but this one provided a wide, constant, perfectly equal stream of water across the entire shower head.  I found it impressive as I have tried other similar shower heads and some of the streams tend to be less than the others, very uneven, but with this one, it is nearly perfectly distributed across the entire shower head!Now for water usage, as it is not stated anywhere in the specifications.  I crudely measured it by filling up a 2 gallon pot and timing it at 1 minute.  With this one it seems to be about 1.25 gallons of water in that minute, so 1.25gpm.  So this uses quite a bit less than other similar heads which will help with water conservation and your hot water.  It does though use quite a bit more than my original shower head (Kohler) but it also covers about 5 times the area!  I love how my entire body is being hit with water all at the same time, and I am a pretty big guy.Now for the unique feature in this shower head, the expandable leafs that makes it 2"" wider.  It works well, although the pieces connecting the leaves are a white color, which does not match the shower head well.  I really do wish they had went with either a gray color that matched the shower head or made it a chrome color.  The white feels almost like it isn't meant to be exposed and overall detracts from the beauty of this design.  To expand it you have to grab leaves on the opposite sides of each other and gently pull them outward, so it isn't exactly anything special or high tech and I do wonder how many times you can expand it before it cracks, as it does feel a little flimsy when the leaves are expanded. As for the actual experience, I really preferred having the shower head closed, as I can feel the gaps when it is fully expanded as the water is now not uniformly hitting your body.  I will try it expanded and also retracted and see if my preference changes but so far I like it retracted.I do not have an overhead shower adapter, so mine does angle from the wall a little.  The shower head gives you SOME room for adjustment but honestly doesn't move much, most likely due to the size being restrictive.  It did not touch my walls or anything, it just doesn't have a high degree of freedom in aiming it.  It did however keep whatever position it was placed in without sagging / falling back down.Overall, I love it and would recommend it, however I do not like the white plastic pieces that become visible when the leaves are extended and I am concerned with long term durability as it feels a little flimsy when expanded, not to mention it isn't exactly easy to expand, especially with wet hands, so I would think you keep it in one or the other configuration permanently. For the price, it does seem to be a better quality shower head, and honestly the design is insanely unique!  I am sure I will be getting compliments from guests when they see this thing! :)TLDR:PROS: Excellent Quality, Great Modern Look, Fast Easy Installation, Water Flow Feels Incredible!CONS: Hard to expand and when expanded it feels flimsy. White connectors when expanded do not match look of shower head. Higher Water Usage (Approximately 1.25 gallons per minute) which results in more hot water which increases utility costs.CONCLUSION: No Issue with the actual shower head, highly recommended if you want a large shower head that can cover your entire body and does not use an excessive amount of water, although this is definitely not a water saver shower head and you will probably have to take quicker showers if you have multiple folks waiting to use it in order to conserve your hot water.DISCLAIMER: I was actually in the market for a new shower head when I was offered one at a discount by the company.

"The quality is VERY good and feels like something much higher end than the price sold here.  I had already visited my local Home Depot and Lowes in search of a replacement head and I will say that this shower head compares easily to a lot of the much more expensive ones offered there.  But in reality, I did not see a modern style glass one designed like this so it is unique in those respects.The Installation was incredibly easy, I unscrewed my old shower head (Kohler) and screwed this one on, and that was it, literally less than 2 minutes to uninstall the old one and install the new one.  I was very happy about that as I'm not exactly a handy man and was afraid I would have to hire someone.There was another review that stated that the shower head would not maintain the position it was tilted at and would ""fall"" after a few seconds.  I have showered with this for close to a week and tested every conceivable angle and it never slumped back down, it kept the position I would place it in without issue.  If yours slumps make sure that you have tightened it properly, or email the vendor as it might be defective.So now to the most important question, HOW DOES IT FEEL!?  Honestly, it feel incredible!  I love it!  It was like I was swimming in a monsoon with a solid downpour of water, and the pressure was great!  It felt way better than my Kohler that I had replaced and I was now excited, looking forward to showering each and every time!  In fact, I think it improved my hygiene as I was looking for excuses to hit the shower! :)Now to the negative.  Although the quality is excellent, the installation was super easy, and the feel of the water was incredible, there were a couple of issues that are more specific to ones personal preferences.  The first being the fact that it uses A LOT of water.  I tested it multiple times, with the shower head filling up a 2 gallon pot and I estimate that it has a flow rate of approximately 1.8 gallons per minute.  This is significantly more than my previous Kohler shower head.  Due to the increased flow, the hot water would run out much faster.  This is really the only negative, so if you have one of those tankless water heaters (I have a large traditional gas water heater), then it might not be an issue as you would have an endless supply of hot water.  But keep in mind, it will use more electricity or gas to heat up the water due to the high flow rate.  And if you pay for your water usage, it will increase that a bit. To be fair, there are other shower heads that use upwards of 3gpm, so in those respects, this is still not as bad as some out there.  The difference is that those state it in their specifications.If you're a conservationist looking to be eco-friendly, this might not be the shower head for you as you will use more fossil fuels heating water.  And if you're going from a water-saver shower head to this you will be shocked at the increased use. If you don't mind that, and are looking for a luxurious shower experience with a high quality shower head, then definitely go for this one!!!  I had absolutely no problems with the product itself except for the extremely high flow design which was not stated anywhere in the product specifications.TLDR:PROS: Excellent Quality, Great Modern Look, Fast Easy Installation, Water Flow Feels Incredible!CONS: Not Eco-Friendly due to High Water Usage (Approximately 1.8 gallons per minute) which uses more hot water which increases utility costs. This needs to be stated in the product specifications.CONCLUSION: No Issue with the actual shower head, highly recommended if you're going for that modern look and are okay with the high flow design.DISCLAIMER: I was actually in the market for a new shower head when I was offered one at a discount by the company.

"I tend to drink a few sodas per week, and I wanted something that would keep my my hands from getting cold and also to stop the condensation that appears on the cans. This does both, but I will say that the fit is not as snug as I'd want it to be as there is a noticeable gap all around and the can does ""wobble"" inside the holder slightly if you shake it back and forth, not a whole lot, but it does move.  The thermos beverage can insulator is flexible, if you squeeze it lightly it will deform.  This brings up concerns with how long the actual vacuum will hold up under heavy use and with constant flexing of the metal.  As for keeping it ice cold, in my experience an open can of soda will keep ""cold"" for maybe an hour or so, with it staying ""cool"" for another hour or so.  If you keep an unopened can in there it does seem to keep it pretty cold for over 2 hours though, but it seems if the can is opened a lot of the coolness escapes.Overall, it does the job, it does keep it cold longer than without.  It keeps my hands from being cold and it keeps things dry as you can set it on a table without it condensating.  Truthfully though, who takes 3 hours to drink a can of soda?  I finish most of mine in under 30 minutes so it is more than enough for me. I wish it was a little tighter around the can and that the metal was a little more sturdy, but it is a good product regardless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFPC7UTL5CBGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000644AF#wasThisHelpful","RFPC7UTL5CBGF","A2USRFOMNH7CGI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2USRFOMNH7CGI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this for several months now and so far it is exactly what I was looking for!  What was I looking for?  A light to kick on when we walked up to our home at night so we could find the keys and unlock the door.  It works great, is extremely bright, has a wide beam throw, and activates from about 10 ft away so it easily lights up the walking path to the door so we don't trip over any packages.  I ended up using the adhesive to stick the light mount to the top of the metal front door.  So far it hasn't fallen off but I am very concerned I will come home one day and see my light, broken, on the ground.  If it does happen I will definitely update this review. The only real negative I have is that it slides off the mount very easily, so it is possible that someone could easily take your light with little effort.  Now, on the flip side, i have on several occasions slide the light off the mount and used it as a flash light while looking for something in the yard, as long as you keep moving it will stay on.Overall, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Works great, and I hope the batteries last a while.*** UPDATE 6/18/2015 ***So it has been about 6 months since my last review and I wanted to say that I AM STILL ON THE ORIGINAL SET OF BATTERIES!  The light is triggered probably twice a day, staying on for as long as we need to while unlocking the front door, and then shuts off.  To be fair, it has gotten about 50% dimmer due to the decreased battery capacity but it is still very much useable and I will not be changing the batteries for probably a few more days.

"I tried this out for several weeks, using it daily.  It fit snugly into my 2012 Toyota Camry XLE CD player slot and held my phone firmly. Unfortunately, the actual part that goes into the CD player is tight but the arm that holds the phone mount wobbles so incredibly bad while driving that you can not see what is on your actual phone screen.  The intense vibration makes it really useless, as I could not read street names on my phone's GPS as it was shaking so badly.  The rubber prongs that hold it in the CD player also cause the felt parts on the CD slot, that protect the CD player, to deform which makes it look horrible as well.  Beyond that, if it had worked and held the phone firmly without the shaking, and it also didn't damage the CD player slot, I would have been happy.  It does put your phone at the perfect location so you can easily tap the screen and see things clearly.PROS- Works as advertised, holds phone via CD slot.- Decent Build Quality.CONS- Shakes badly while driving making it incredibly difficult, to read the GPS on the phone due to vibration.- Damages CD slot felt protector, hopefully not permanently.I ended up going with a AC Vent Slot holder which does not look as nice but seems to hold it much firmly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26EL42LUB92P1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MASNZ8O#wasThisHelpful","R26EL42LUB92P1","A2USRFOMNH7CGI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2USRFOMNH7CGI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I finally ran out of the Xacto blades and wanted to get some more.  After researching exhaustively I went ahead and bought these aftermarket blades.  I will say, compared to the Xacto blades, they perform nearly identically. But for the price, you can buy twice as many of these for the same price as the Xacto, so even if it was not quite as good as Xacto, you would still come out WAY ahead by buying the Techni Edge blades. Just like with the Xacto blades, If you change the blade out when it starts becoming dull, it offers a great cut, and there really is no noticeable difference in quality.

"I just got it yesterday, so I've only had it for about a day so far.  My impressions so far are mixed.  The case looks great, it feels great as well.  The issue I have with the finish is that it really is prone to marks, scratches, smudges, etc.  It is some sort of matte plastic finish with a velvety feel. Interestingly though, it seems, at least to me, to make the phone more slippery!  I have already on several occasions pulled the phone out of my pocket and nearly had it slip out of my hand.The case itself is also quite large, nearly doubling the thickness of the phone, it also makes it heavier by adding 2oz more to the weight. When you hold the phone without the case it feels nice, and well balanced.  With this case the phone feels unbalanced almost unstable in your hand. I am guessing it is from the distribution of the battery weight in the rear of the case.As for protection, from the looks of it the case offers absolutely no protection, as the sole function is to provide your phone with extra battery capacity.  The only real protection I can see is that the edges of the case come up on the sides from the face of the phone so it helps protect it from surfaces if you were to lay the phone's screen down onto a surface.  The case itself that surrounds it is just a flexible plastic, so if you did drop it, it might save the screen and prevent major damage BUT most likely at the cost of the incipio case itself.The case also puts a border around the edge of the screen which makes it difficult to swipe left and right in order to bring up the side menus that are prevalent on the Fire Phone.  If you keep the gestures turned on you can still tilt it to the left and right, but I turned them off due to them accidentally getting in the way time and time again.The other issue which I am absolutely not happy about most of all is the fact that you have to use a special micro usb cable that is suppose to come with the offgrid case.  The charging port is deep inside the case and the edges are crafted to only fit incipio's micro usb cable.  If you try to use any other cable the plastic edges of the micro usb adapter will not fit completely and due to this the cable will not stay in.  Yes, it will charge with other micro USB cables, but only if you don't touch the phone, as otherwise those cables will just fall out as they are not seated completely into the micro usb plug within the offgrid case.One thing I really do like about the case is the fact that there is a button on the back that, when pressed momentarily, will light up 4 little leds to show you how much power is left. Also, the extra battery does not kick in until you tell it to, that way you're not always draining the external offgrid battery. To enable it you hold the button down for a few seconds and it will enable, charging your dying phone. There is also a couple of little holes at the bottom part that redirect the sound from the two speakers forward, and it seems to actually improves the sound quality.I needed more battery life, as the Fire Phone does have a pretty fast battery drain, so that is why I got this case. Unfortunately, with all the other negatives I am unsure if it will be worth the high cost in the long run.  I have given it a balanced 3 stars, but if this review is found helpful by folks I will update it as time goes on.***UPDATE 12/04/2014***Well, I was able to charge it up and actually use it to charge up my battery, it seems to add about 60% to the Fire Phone before being completely depleted.  This is without using the phone at all, letting it sit, being charged by the Offgrid case without touching the phone at all.  This was a tad disappointing as the Fire Phone has a built in 2400mah battery while the Offgrid case has a 2,700mah battery.  I do understand there is always going to be some power transfer loss during the charge, but I was hoping it would at least give it 80%, as the photo on the box seems to show it adding approximately 80% additional capacity.  I will do a FRESH reboot of the phone and try it again to ensure there were no vampire apps loaded up that were causing the phone to drain more than normal.  But as of right now, the OffGrid Case can add 60% to the battery built into the Fire Phone on a full charge.***UPDATE 12/06/2014***Well, the OffGrid case is now doing something strange.  When I enable it, the phone will begin charging without issue from the case, but then it will disconnect after 15% or so of use.  I will then had to push and hold the button down again, it will do it for a little more, then disconnect once more.  On the third attempt the button is no longer responsive and the little LEDs on the back of the case quit working.  The only way to ""Fix"" it was to plug the OffGrid case into a Micro USB plug to trigger it to charge, for just a second.  Then I was able to do it again a few times before having to ""reset"" the OffGrid case again.  No idea what is going on, but it almost seems to be triggering it to stop charging, and after a few attempts it just locks up and does not work without a reset via a micro USB cord.  I have emailed the company and awaiting a response.***UPDATE 12/08/2014***Well, after an overnight complete charge, the case seemed to work again without issue.  Although to be fair, previously when I had the issue I was attempting to charge the Fire Phone from 20% remaining life, so perhaps due to it being so discharged it was possibly pulling more power to charge faster than the Offgrid could handle?  Not sure.  But I was able to charge it from 40% to 100% without issue and it did not trip and shut off.  Hopefully it was just a fluke and not a sign of things to come.  After 3 emails, I have still not heard from the company.  I had originally heard that Incipio had decent customer support, but as of right now no one is answering their emails.  Maybe they are all off for the Holidays???***UPDATE 12/10/2014***After another email, I finally heard back from the company.  I was told that the issue I was having, it prematurely disengaging the charge cycle, is a flaw in the actual hardware and that it was eligible for warranty replacement.  I will let you know when I receive it if the problem still persists. I will be happy if I can go from a 20% battery to 100% without it shutting off, and if that is the case then I will be very satisfied! It has been a real bummer having this huge case and it really offering no benefit due to my issue, so I am excited to see if the replacement works without any problems.  Even though it took nearly 6 days for a response, they seemed to be very courteous, prompt, and professional once they do respond.***UPDATE 12/14/2014***I received the replacement case today and so far so good.  It seems to work well and keeps a charge.  On the initial test run it charged it from 15% to 95% before stopping (80% Charge Capacity!) so that matches the box claims exactly. I am still unsure if it will survive a real drop, but at the very least I suppose it should protect the phone, although the thought of losing a nearly $100 phone case is also kind of unsettling. I will say that, even given that I was ignored for a week, I am very impressed at how quickly the company came through to ship me a working case!  Maybe they really were just having email issues?***UPDATE 12/16/2014***So I've been using it for a few days and it is nice to not have to worry about finding a charger all the time.  I can just use the phone as much as I want, don't even plug it in when using WAZE in the car.  When it gets to around 20% I kick on the charge!  Now the issue I do have is that I have noticed I accidentally bumped the charge button multiple times, so I was surprised to see my phone at 100% half way through the day but it was still charging.  If you hit the charge button in the incipio case and it hits 100% it will just keep trickle charging it from what it appears to maintain it to 100%.***UPDATE 2/26/2015***LOWERED TO 2 STARSWell, I received the replacement case, it worked well for about a month before sporadically having the same issue as before.  I hit the button, it charges for maybe a few minutes, then it quits charging and will no longer function until you plug the battery pack up and charge it again.  It is almost like some protection circuit inside the unit is tripping completely disconnecting the case from working until you plug it up to power once again.  The other possibility is that it is never completely charging and it just charges what little is left in the battery pack and then shuts off.  Either way, I find it frustrating that I can no longer, once again, rely on having a backup battery solution.  I will be contacting incipio again to see what can be done.*** UPDATE 6/18/2015 ***Well, I have still been using this case since I purchased it.  The company has grown unresponsive.  Although I did a complete discharge of the Battery Case and charged it up and it seems to not provide a slight charge.  As long as I don't let the phone battery fall below 65% I can bring it back up to a 100% charge.  Once it falls below that threshold it seems to only give me a 20% or so charge before completely ""Crashing"" and no longer functioning until it is plugged up again for a reset. This has basically made the offGRID case unreliable to the point I now carry a portable power brick in my bag in case my offGRID fails, again.  :(Overall, I can not recommend this case, and most likely the company doesn't care due to the fact that they are not making any Amazon Fire Phone products anymore so they are not interested in supporting the case. What I hope they understand is that customers tend to share their experiences, regardless of what types of phones other people have, and most people tend to switch phone brands/models often.  So it might be wise to support customers regardless of their phone and your product offerings as they may be a customer in the future.  At this point I am unsure if I would trust an incipio case again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPIVE2WC2LI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OAM9690#wasThisHelpful","R3PPIVE2WC2LI4","A2USRFOMNH7CGI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2USRFOMNH7CGI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased four of these phones when it was originally released back in July 2011.  My family has been using all four everyday, since then, going on 3.5 years!  None of us have cracked screens, and there have been very few issues.  One being that the power button can get ""jammed"" and needs to be blown out with compressed air to work properly again, otherwise it will continue to randomly reboot.  The other is that one of the phones suffered from screen burn in after it got stuck overnight on the alarm app.  beyond that, we've had no issues!The one good thing about this phone is that it has had a ton of support from the aftermarket custom ROM community, and there are numerous options to bring it from the original Froyo / Gingerbread to Jellybean and even KitKat version of Android.  It is very easy to do and instructions can be found on the XdaDevelopers website.  http://forum.xda-developers.com/infuse-4gI currently have a couple of them running KitKat with minimal problems (Camera is stuck at 480p otherwise it stutters and HDMI out is disabled), but it runs great with this latest release!  The other two are still running stock Gingerbread and have no issues whatsoever!Now I will be upfront, these are old phones, I mean at the time the Infuse was the largest / thinnest available smartphone, my how times have changed!!! This thing is ""tiny"" compared to what is now available!  The processor isn't the fastest, and the memory is lacking, although you can expand it via a microSD without issue. It also won't run a lot of the latest games without a lot of lag.  But if you need a phone that uses many apps without issue (Waze, youtube, gmail, twitter, facebook, snapchat, etc) then this will do just fine! :)  And the cool thing is that it still looks great so no one will know how outdated it is. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REAK0DYL1X3AG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00578HQAW#wasThisHelpful","REAK0DYL1X3AG","A2USRFOMNH7CGI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2USRFOMNH7CGI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have only had the screen for a week or so, but in that time it has worked very well.  Now I must be upfront and state that the chances of you getting an undamaged screen are pretty low.  Mine came with a couple of dents in the rear, as the metal seems to be thinner on the back of the screen vs the front.  These ""dents"" were produced from pressure being put on or near the center of the screen, the motors on the edges weighing them down causing the metal to buckle.  So if you do get a flawless screen, make sure you have two people lift the screen up!  If you do it with only yourself holding it near the middle or on one end it will cause the screen to flex, bend, and buckle causing the metal to dent pretty badly.As for the motors, it is quiet, and works quite well!  One thing I have to warn, if you have the power outlet wired into a dimmer, make sure the switch is not dimmed when operating the motor.  The dimmer will reduce the power flow to the motors and the motors will not function correctly.  The Remote worked great as did the box built into the cable.  THE CABLE IS LOCATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN.The thin metal housing is a concern if you are planning on transporting this screen as I am unsure if it would survive.  Also, the plastic end caps attached to the metal loops are also something I am wondering will crack and fail over time, although, to be fair, the plastic is quite thick.As for the screen itself, it was pretty good with only slight imperfections that are not noticeable when a projector is in use.If there is enough interest in my review, I will continually update it to let you guys know how it goes.***UPDATE 6/15/2015***The motor has held up well and works just like the first day I used it.  The imperfections have lessened but unfortunately when the projector is off you can still notice them  The edges of the screen have a slight curl to them but once the projector is running it is not noticeable. Overall, I feel it was still an incredible deal!  I have had numerous folks over for movie night and all of them have been impressed by the setup, several of them have gone on to order one for themselves and have been happy with it.Thank you so much for all the helpful votes, I can see there is interest and due to this I will try to continue to periodically update this review to let others know about the overall quality and durability of this screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMIDG01SELN1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J22TM7Y#wasThisHelpful","RMIDG01SELN1T","A2USRFOMNH7CGI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2USRFOMNH7CGI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great storage case that is heavy duty and zips closed to protect the contents.  I prefer this zipper storage case over the old classic wooden box as it stays closed when zipped while the wooden box would tend to unlatch.

If I forget to take it I can usually notice the next day as I will have pretty severe allergies, coughing, headache, etc.  Epicor is highly effective for allergies, although I will say that I have not noticed it preventing me from getting sick any more than usual.One thing I did notice is that some batches will be pristine with the pills being a brownish color, while other batches will have white splotches within the pills.  I contacted the manufacturer and was told this is a normal variable and the product was still safe and within their guidelines, it all depends on how it is mixed and settles but it does have the doses of Epicor and Vitamin D3 stated. I was also told that the protective seal may come loose and when you unscrew it the first time it will come off and appear to be unsealed, that is the reason they put the plastic ring around it.  The reason being they use a food quality safe adhesive that can come unglued.

I am now on 2 weeks of taking these capsules and although I have not seen a huge difference in my body, I still have seen somewhat of a difference. I have lost a few inches off my waist and I don't feel as tired and lethargic as I normally do. Looking forward to seeing future results!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O4CJVN9YEYPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RUURR9U#wasThisHelpful","R1O4CJVN9YEYPG","AAMS5L1FD6U5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAMS5L1FD6U5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been taking Alpha Lipoid Acid for quite a while now and was not impressed by the regular pill form it came in. After browsing Amazon I saw that BRI offered them in a softgels form and knew I needed to get my hands on them. Sure enough, these are much easier to take and I don't hesitate when taking them everyday with my vitamins. My skin looks better, my energy level is through the roof and I feel as if ALA helps me take that extra step in a healthier lifestyle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EFB6Y23CN6YB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0F2OUC#wasThisHelpful","R3EFB6Y23CN6YB","AAMS5L1FD6U5N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAMS5L1FD6U5N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of mine recommended that I download VAN LAVEN CHRONICLES SHADOW REIGN: SHADOW REIGN for a 3 hour flight I was going on. I am glad that I took his word because this ended up being a great book! The main characters (Vaush and Comron) are what make this book a great read.

"Cathedral Hills is a great Christian based book that turns from a sad life story to a love story within moments. Jenna, a 23 year old girl has gone through more in life then most young adults have as her mother died and her father fell off the wagon. Meanwhile, she ended up losing all of her friends and everyone she knew and cared for. Jenna navigates an emotional roller coaster throughout the journey of questioning whether God will help her find her path in life.What a great story with a great end that captures you into the story, making you question Jenna's thoughts and actions.

"I got this test size of Glycolic Serum for my cousin because we didn't know if this would irritate her skin due to her having a bit of sensitivity with many products. We went ahead and placed a small amount behind her ear and waited 24 hours to see if she got a reaction, which she didn't. After the initial 24 hours we decided to apply it onto the top of her hand to see if a larger patch of area would get affected as well. We concluded this serum is OK with her and didn't cause her any issue. We were worried because her skin is sometimes over sensitive to some products but now we know this serum is OK with her and that we can invest in the full size bottle. I love this small test size!

"I am not your usual young woman. I like to really look after myself and take care of my skin. Recently though, I have noticed that my skin has gotten a bit drier than usual and I have started to get some fine lines. I know that this is unavoidable due to aging, but I really wanted to control it once I noticed the lines and dryness.I wanted to find something with Vitamin E as I heard that it is amazing for skin. So after a bit of searching I found this anti-oxidant oil based serum which stated it tackled the problems I was having with my skin. This one has 10% vitamin C, which is great and was the main reason I bought it. What I love about this serum is that it is 100% oil based by non greasy nor any odor! After about 10 minutes of applying it, the serum is matte and my skin is silky and smooth!I do also combine this with same company's Beta Glucan cream to moisturizing parts of my skin that have darkened due to dryness, but that is my personal preference.

These are a great alternative to oven mitts and a lot easier to use as you can grab pans with your actual hands.

"I moved into a new condo that had a security system already installed. Unfortunately, a lot of the Honeywell 5816 transmitters on windows and doors were missing magnets, so they were constantly faulted when I turned the system on. I bought these magnets to replace missing ones. They worked great for doors, but not all windows. They were too big for my double hung windows. I'll post a product pic so you can see what I mean. I needed a Honeywell Ademco 5899B magnet for the windows. That's a similar magnet to this one, only smaller. I do recommend the smaller ones over these bigger ones. It's a better bet that they'll fit where you need them to fit!Also, you may want to shop around for a better price for this product. When I bought it a couple months ago, the pack of 4 was just under $15. Now it's almost $20. I'm giving the product 5 stars because it does what it's supposed to with no issues.

"At the start of the year, I decided to get on board with the stand up desk craze. I read about all the benefits and such and decided to give it a shot. I want to live longer. Not sure it really will extend my life, but it's definitely better than just sitting around.The first 2 weeks were hard, but it got easier after that. At first I'd lean a lot, shift from side to side, and take a lot of sitting breaks. With time, I started spending more and more time standing up straight. The only problem was that over time, I've developed pain in my heels. I know I'm not always in ideal posture. Knees are supposed to be slightly bent so that they're over the center of your foot, that moves some weight from heels to toes. It's hard to constantly remember to correct my posture though. I'd subconsciously move back to my heels.So plan B. Instead of mastering posture that would allow me to stand without pain on thinly carpeted concrete, I decided to change what I was standing on. I bought this 24x36 inch Stanley utility mat, and I'm so glad I did. On the day it arrived, my heels were already aching. It was lunchtime when the mat arrived. I eagerly opened up my package and put the mat underneath me. It was miraculous. I'd step on the ""carpet"", my heels would ache, I'd step on the mat, the aching would almost completely disappear. That helped me last the rest of the day without much pain. Starting the day after, no heal pain at all.I'm so glad I bought this product! I definitely recommend it for people who stand stationary for a couple or more hours a day, like I do. I stand about 7 hours daily, and this makes it alright. When I first searched for anti fatigue mats, I was very put off by pricing. This 24x36 inch mat for $40 is a lot better than other top rated mats I've seen out there.

"I love trying new coffee brands, styles, and flavors. Every month or so, I try a new coffee off of Amazon or from my local grocery store. This is possibly the best of all that I've tried. It is a matter of taste, so I can't say this coffee is for everyone. It's definitely a medium roast - smooth, strong in taste with no bitterness. If you don't like flavored coffee or only want your coffee dark roasted, this may not be for you. If you're anyone else, I very highly recommend this product!!The experience starts with the smell during brewing. It filled my kitchen with awesomeness and got me excited. I usually like my coffee with barely enough half and half to change the color and one spoon of sugar. When I'm trying a coffee for the first time, I taste it black first, then add my milk and sugar. This coffee tasted really good before I added anything. I could drink it black, and that's rare for me. I still do prefer it with my milk and sugar though. The flavor is terrific. I'm not the best at identifying flavors. I may not have been able to tell you this was vanilla macadamia if I had blind tasted it. All I know is - I absolutely love the flavor.This coffee is as good as it gets for me in all categories - taste, strength, smoothness, and acidity. If you're not opposed to flavored coffee or medium roasts, get this now!! I doubt you'll be disappointed. Other ground coffees I recommend (all medium roasts available on Amazon): Tim Hortons Coffee, Dallmayr Gourmet Coffee, and my previous favorite, Lion Coffee Toasted Coconut (also a flavored Kona blend).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PTLQL2FH1GB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009J93BTU#wasThisHelpful","R3PTLQL2FH1GB7","A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 9 foot hanging wire met my needs and was definitely worth the $4 I paid for it. That's honestly a great price. I used it to hang up a 24x36 inch canvas in a fairly heavy frame. The wire is flexible enough that it's easy to bend, loop, and move around, yet it's firm enough that it won't come apart when twisted together. I used less than 4 feet of it for hanging the painting.

"I have GE fridge model number GSS22KGMA WW. I noticed it was leaking water last week from under the freezer side. When I opened up the freezer, it felt warmer than a freezer should. I could see that the source of the water was the ice in the ice maker melting.I was worried it would be expensive to repair or that I'd need a new fridge. I have no idea how old my fridge is. I did a Google search and followed advice to look inside the freezer to see if the back had frost on it, and it did. Online threads I read said it was most likely the defrost heater element. I unplugged the fridge and followed instructions to get the old heater element out. Sure enough, that was the issue :)I looked online for replacement parts. Buying a replacement from GE is just shy of $40. This compatible defrost heater is a fraction of the price (under $10 at the time of purchase)! I ordered this part and fixed my own fridge 2 days later, on Sunday (thanks to Sunday delivery). I couldn't be more pleased. I saved some money, and the issue wasn't as big as I thought it would be. I do recommend changing this part out yourself. It isn't difficult.I recommend this product for the price! I don't know about durability. I see that some of the negative reviews say it doesn't last long. I'll be sure to update my review if I have any issues with it over time. I just installed it a couple days ago.INSTALLATION NOTE: To clarify, this is a dual defrost heater, even though the pictures above show a single defrost heater. That means this should last longer, but if you're replacing a single defrost heater, there's an extra step in the installation process. You'll have to move one of the 2 wires that connect to the heater element from the left side of the fridge to the right side (so that both connectors are on the right side of the heater element). I had to do that. No big deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFANMN4VI81FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Q2BKQC#wasThisHelpful","RFANMN4VI81FF","A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm an immigrant to the States from a far off land where bidets are common. The transition to the American ""dry erase"" cleanup method has be a literal pain in the rear. That drove me to do some research. I decided to buy this bidet first: LUXE Bidet Vi-110 I love it. It's still in use in the guest bathroom. Super easy to install and use. The issue is that the water gets extremely cold in the winter where I live in Ohio. The Luxe bidet has no hot water hookup. It's usable in winter, but seriously uncomfortable. So I decided to give this Hyundae bidet a shot.Now that I have this Hyundae bidet installed, it's definitely a comfort upgrade from the Luxe. However, some drawbacks to consider:1 - In my house, it takes the water forever to heat up. The water comes out of the bidet cold for up to a minute, even when the heat setting is on the highest. It's not as cold as the Luxe cold water only bidet, so I still do recommend it for winter. How long your water takes to heat up is something to take into account!2 - Installation was such a pain. Seriously! I'm generally a do-it-yourself guy, although I don't know much about plumbing. Connecting the hot water tube to under the sink was a struggle for me. The sizes were different, so I had to make a couple visits to Lowe's to get the right adapters. Perhaps it's best to hire a plumber to do the job if you're not big on plumbing.Those are the 2 reasons I've detracted a star. I've posted pictures in the product gallery with comments. That will give you an idea on what goes into installing and using this bidet. If you live in a warmer area, I do recommend going with the cold water bidet. The link to the Luxe one I recommend is above. This bidet is a good option for colder climates.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E58VDTT5Q5GF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FKHFZO#wasThisHelpful","R1E58VDTT5Q5GF","A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used to be pretty frugal with my printer. I have a Canon MG6120, which uses 6 different ink cartridges. It runs out of ink way quicker than I'd like, so I just didn't use it much...only when I absolutely needed to. Now that I've discovered these replacement cartridges, I do a lot more printing!At the time of this review, an official PGI-225 cartridge is $15.99 directly from Canon. This is a set of 3 of pretty much the same thing for $11.99 from Blake Printing. That's $3.99 per cartridge instead of $15.99. That's some serious savings!!I usually buy all the different colors of ink cartridges in one pack together. That's offered by Blake here on Amazon as well: 12 Pack Compatible Canon CLI-226 , PGI-225 2 Small Black, 2 Cyan, 2 Gray, 2 Magenta, 2 Yellow, 2 Big Black. I run out of black ink first though, so every now and then it's necessary for me to buy one of these 3 packs of black cartridges.I cannot recommend this product enough. I can see no quality difference between these cartridges and the official Canon ones, only a drastic price difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVZD2H0V0PE7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJPKAWE#wasThisHelpful","RVZD2H0V0PE7F","A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I definitely like this shelf. I do wish it was cheaper (currently $57 for the black 5 shelf), but I wasn't able to find a better deal for the size/capacity. This shelving unit claims it can hold up to ""125 lbs per shelf evenly distributed"". That may be possible under ideal conditions and weight distribution, but I'd recommend against nearing that weight limit. I got this shelving unit to organize my garage. So far, it's been doing a great job of that. I posted a picture in the gallery so you can get an idea of what it looks like fully loaded.I've read other reviewers claims that it leans or that the shelves sag. You'll definitely need to exercise some common sense when loading the shelves. It may be rated for 125 lbs per shelf, but I can tell you right now, if you only put 125 lbs on the top shelf and nothing on any other shelf, this thing will lean. Weight distribution matters! Put heavier things on the bottom. Also, if you put some small dense 125 pound item in the center of one of these shelves, it will sag under the weight. So make sure you distribute weight evenly on each shelf, and try to put heavier items on the bottom or as close to the bottom of the shelving unit as possible.I recommend this shelf for people who are just using it as a garage or laundry room shelf and don't intend on hitting the 125 lbs per shelf weight limit. I'm detracting 1 star because (1) I do think this shelf should be a little cheaper for what it is and (2) it's not going to be stable if you blindly follow the ""125 lbs per shelf"" claim that's being made.The product description states ""Can be divided into a 3-shelf unit and 2-shelf unit"". I haven't tried, but that may be a good option if you want it to be more stable with a lot of weight on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGL150ZV1U44F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OF2O1Y#wasThisHelpful","RGL150ZV1U44F","A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I bought this drain pan a couple weeks ago, it was $6.15. The price has gone up a couple dollars since then. For the price I got it for, this is a steal. Look around on Amazon and elsewhere. I wasn't able to find a drain pan this big with a spout for the price.With that said, what other reviewers have said about the spout is true. My spout lid closes just fine, but the spout really should be pointing up, not down. After pouring liquid out of the spout, it continues to drip till I close the lid over it, getting some liquid on my hands and around the lid. This would not be an issue if the spout was angled upward.Even with that one downer, I'm giving this a 5 star rating because of the incredible value. For $6.15 this is as good as it gets!

"I bought the following king mattress on Amazon based on stellar reviews: Brentwood Finale 11-Inch Quilted Eurotop Inner Spring Mattress, Made in the USA, Full Size My wife absolutely loved the mattress, but I wasn't all that impressed. It's a tad too soft. At the same time, we'd bought a memory foam mattress for our guest bedroom, and I had a memory foam topper on my old twin bed from my bachelor days. Sleeping on those was a more pleasant experience for me. So the wife agreed to get a memory foam topper for our new inner spring mattress.I decided on this mattress topper because it's rated quite well, met the description of what I was looking for, and the price is awesome ($150 at time of purchase). It arrived quickly and rolled up nicely. I unrolled it and gave it a day to air out, although I didn't smell anything. My sense of smell is known to be lacking though. I set it on our king mattress, and it covered it perfectly. Other reviews have mentioned that this topper is a little too big, but it's perfectly sized for our mattress.Anyway, I lay down on it, and it's divine. It feels so comfy. Adds a little firmness to a bed that was too soft for my taste. This mattress topper feels so good! It's not too firm or too soft. Actually, I think it would be just as good for softening a mattress that's too firm as it was in firming up our overly soft mattress. The material that covers the topper feels so good...too bad we have to put a protector and fitted sheets over it.I very much recommend this mattress topper. It has made my dreams that much better!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UAFA5MMGLQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GER6AY#wasThisHelpful","R7UAFA5MMGLQG","A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I decided I wanted a stand up desk several months ago after reading a couple articles on the health benefits. I found some cardboard boxes around the office and propped my 2 monitors, laptop, and keyboard on a makeshift stand up desk. That worked great for a couple months! The first week was the hardest, but it quickly got easier. The biggest pain was the fact that it would be too much work to disassemble and reassemble it if I wanted to sit for a short amount of time. So I just stood all the time, which wasn't convenient. A couple weeks ago, my cardboard makeshift desk collapsed in on itself. Fortunately, there was no damage to anything, but that incident convinced me it was time for the real deal. I'd been standing long enough to know it wasn't just another one of my whims.We ordered this desk and it came a day earlier than anticipated. Setting it up was cake. There's no assembly. I got everything setup in 15 mins, and it was back to work. I love the desk. I'm 5'10"" (1.78 meters), and this desk is the ideal height for me at it's highest setting, so I can understand why taller people have given the desk negative reviews. My review may not have been as good if I was a couple inches taller myself. For my height, it's perfect. I've posted a couple pictures so you can get an idea of what it looks like. The second picture I posted shows how the desk looks next to me, a 5 foot 10 inch guy.Some have said the desk is unstable. The monitors do shake a little when I pound away at the keyboard, and I'm detracting one star for that. I wouldn't call it ""unstable"" though since I don't see any chance of it falling or of anything falling off of it. It's only a minor inconvenience. I adapted quickly. It didn't bug me much considering my last desk was cardboard :) I do recommend this desk for people that are my height or shorter....and maybe an inch taller.Being able to easily switch being sitting and standing is a big plus!

"These are the best boxer briefs I've ever owned. Actually, they're the best undergarments of any kind that I've ever owned. I bought a red (cabernet) pair and a navy blue (arctic night) pair. I got them in medium, which is my usual size, and they fit great. I wanted to treat myself to a nice comfy pair of underwear after my usual Hanes boxer briefs started wearing out again. I'd buy those in bulk. I decided to give these CK Modal briefs a try since they were rated highly online - despite the price tag, which can be a bit discouraging. I decided to make the purchase, and I'm so glad I did.These are the most comfortable boxers I've had the pleasure of pulling up. The material feels so good. When it comes to color, my wife and I both like the red pair more than the navy blue. I was worried that they'd be tight based on the advertised pictures. I looked around online, and all the pictures of these boxer briefs make them look tight. I don't like tight. I suffocate easily down there. These look as tight on me as they do in the pictures, but they don't feel tight at all. They're incredibly comfortable and breathable.The 2 downers are (1) price as I've already mentioned and (2) no easy access opening for the urinal. I think number 2 does result in a more comfortable design, but just not as practical for business time. Despite the 2 downers, I'm still giving this 5/5 stars since (as I may have already mentioned) it's THE most comfortable pair of anything I've ever worn. If you can part with the dollars and cents on the price tag, get these! You won't be disappointed.

"I have a Toyota Camry, and my wife has a Kia Optima. The place I get them serviced at recommended I get the transmission fluid flushed on the vehicles (they're both at around 90k miles). They quoted me $130 per flush for non-synthetic fluid. I called around and couldn't find a better deal. I did some research and decided to do 2 ""drain and fills"" per vehicle instead of flushing the transmission.This was the only synthetic transmission fluid I could find that was recommended for both Toyota (IV) and Kia (SP-III), and at $5.5 per quart it's a steal. I'm really happy with the price and quality of this product.So I made 2 orders (12 quarts total). I did 2 drain and fills on my Camry. I waited a couple days between them. I followed a youtube video on how to do that. It's pretty straight forward as long as you can get under the front of your car somehow (ie, jack and jack stands). In my case I also needed to purchase a 10 mm hex bit to remove the transmission plug and a drain pan (or something else to catch the transmission fluid when it pours out). Each drain and fill used about 3.5 quarts.The gear shifting feels smoother than ever, and I saved a ton of money! My transmission dipstick now shows reddish fluid instead of that brown slime that was there before. It's a beautiful sight and only cost me $38.5 per vehicle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPVZ1DQTH7UDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051ZHC3C#wasThisHelpful","RPVZ1DQTH7UDX","A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RDW3L2EKE9Q5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I drink Bold to Ex. Bold flavored coffees so everything other than that will taste a little watery to me.  But I have to say, this is not bad at all.  If you're like 80% of the coffee drinkers out there that like medium strength coffee, you'll like this particular one.

"Let's be blunt... you're looking at this product and reading this review because you or someone close to you has a problem.  If it's you you're probably sitting down at your computer leaning off to one side, or standing up with your tablet.  That's not important.  What IS important is that you need some relief and you're wondering if this stuff works.I won't say that my problem is worse or bigger than your problem.  What I will tell you is that when my problem shows up, I start referring to myself as ""us"" or ""we"" instead of ""I"" or ""me"".  Last year, while on vacation, I actually started referring to it using a person's name.  Anyway, I told you this to emphasize the truthfulness of the review and give you an idea of what you may expect.I read a lot of reviews about smell and bad breath and all that stuff.  Does this stuff have an odor?... yes, it does.  It's best described as a mixture of medicinal, herbal, with a little bit of dirt scent thrown in there for good measure.  I personally don't find it unpleasant and as a matter of fact, Prep H is worse because it smells fishy to me.  The ointment is extremely thick and doesn't stain undergarments or clothing (something I've recently experienced with the H product).  I'm happy to say my breath is no worse than it is already... let me rephrase... I didn't have bad breath before, during, or after using this product.  Maybe if I emptied the entire tube into my nether regions would this be a problem.  But a little dab will do ya, and there's really no reason to go crazy with this stuff unless you're getting some sort of weird enjoyment out of the application process.Once on, the experience you'll get is one of cooling (like something with eucalyptus or menthol in it but not quite as severe).  The sensation was almost immediate and to be quite honest, a huge relief from the burning and pain of an untreated problem.  After a few minutes the pain went away and lasted quite a long time.  Finally, after less than 24 hours after application, the swelling goes down significantly.This is the first product for this problem I've ever used that actually worked.  I'm amazed at the results, and highly recommend it... both of us do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WX40H4R4H35X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F34TCC#wasThisHelpful","R2WX40H4R4H35X","A18FWPKVLW7RWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FWPKVLW7RWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why switch from Keurig to Tassimo? Espresso, Cappuccino, Latte, and Cafe Ole. Tassimo does them, and for the most part Keurig does not. Keurig has in fact come out with a new machine called the Rivo but there were two things stopping me from purchasing that one: 1) Milk tank on the side of the Rivo instead of milk pods... I can't be bothered with keeping milk in the fridge and cleaning the tank, 2) Price... Rivo is a lot more expensive.First, some thoughts on the Espresso and Cappuccino that comes out of the Tassimo after all, it's why I switched in the first place. I do like the Cappuccino and Espresso that this machine makes... it's good. Is it on par with what I've had at a really good coffee shop or at a cafe in Italy?... not really. Let's face it Espresso and Cappuccino coming out of a $5000 machine, made from freshly ground coffee, with fresh milk, lovingly crafted by a trained Barista is going to be WAY better than anything coming out of the Tassimo. Expectations adjusted, I think this is a very good machine for the $$$ and I like the fact that a decent cup of Cappuccino is now a quick and convenient option for me (and for guests at my home).Next, coffee.  Does the Tassimo make a good cup of coffee? Well, yes and no. Yes the coffee I made (King of Joe Dark Roast) was good, but I like Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic for the Keurig better. So it's not the machine, it's the coffee. All things being equal, I'd say the Tassimo / Keurig coffee making capabilities are identical. As a matter of fact, they even operate in a very similar manner... water goes in a holding tank, you turn the machine on, you put your cup under dispenser, load a pod, push a button, out comes coffee. There are subtle differences though and here are the ones that are really important to me...Power on / energy use... Keurig immediately begins to heat up water and is ready a minute or so later, then it anticipates that you might want a second cup and heats up another cache of water. Tassimo is ready right away and starts heating the water when you push the button. Coffee comes out of the Tassimo machine faster, and rarely do I want a second cup right away. POINT - Tassimo.Cup size... My old Keurig has three cup sizes 6oz., 9oz., and 12oz. Tassimo reads a barcode and dispenses a predetermined amount of water based on the info in the barcode. You can however, press a '+' or '-' button before or during the brew process to adjust the amount of water used. POINT - Tie.Beverage variety... Keurig does coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Tassimo does coffee, tea, hot chocolate, espresso, cappuccino, latte, and cafe ole. POINT - Tassimo.Beverage brands, availability, brand quality... The quality of the coffee is about equal between Keurig and Tassimo. The major difference here is that Keurig has way more variety and choice when it comes to the sheer number of brands and varieties of drinks, plus my favorite coffee is a Keurig-only brand/variety. POINT - Keurig.Beverage quality... Both Keurig and Tassimo make a quality drink. POINT - Tie.Build quality / warranty... Both excellent quality machine, both standard warranties. POINT - Tie.Pod price... Apples to apples (coffee pods only, not coffee/milk pods), without any discounts, the least expensive Keurig pods cost between 61 cents (8 o'clock coffee - 94 cents (Starbucks) each.  Tassimo pods cost between 50 cents (Maxwell House) - 79 cents (Gevalia Dark Breakfast Blend).  POINT - TassimoThere are some other differences that I thought were less important... Tassimo has a smaller water tank (-), Tassimo's water tank accommodates a water filter - I use filtered water so this is sort of a moot point (+), Tassimo is quieter (+), a second cup of coffee takes longer with the Tassimo (-), Tassimo take up less space on the counter (+), Tassimo's cup holder is adjustable - you can remove it entirely or it moves up and down (+).Why I picked the T55 over the other Tassimo models... Simple: the (+) or (-) water adjustment capabilities. The other models allow you ADD water to the brew.  This is something, based on my preference for strong coffee, I would probably NOT do.  I would however choose to run LESS water through the machine and make the brew stronger.Here's my recommendation:1) If getting Espresso, Cappuccino, Latte, and Cafe Ole in addition to Coffee, Tea, and Hot Chocolate out of your machine is important (this is me by the way), then the clear choice is Tassimo.2) If however you only want Coffee, Tea, or Hot Chocolate and huge variety is not really important to you then I still say go with the Tassimo; if anything, you'll save money on the pods.3) Lastly, if you're blown away by the variety and choices of coffees and teas, then go with the Keurig (I THOUGHT this was me, turns out I was wrong... after I tried a bunch of regular and flavored coffees for about two months, I ended up sticking with one brand/variety afterall).GETTING 13 DIFFERENT DRINKS FROM FOUR TASSIMO VARIETIES...Here's what I bought: Caramel Latte Macchiato, Cappuccino, Regular Coffee, Decaf Espresso.  Here's what you can make with that by mixing/matching coffee and milk pods:Caramel Latte Macchiato (as packaged)Caramel Espresso (caramel espresso pod only)Regular Latte (latte milk pod + espresso pod from cappuccino)Decaf Latte (latte milk pod + decaf espresso pod)Cappuccino(as packaged)Regular Espresso (espresso pod only)Caramel Cappuccino (cappuccino milk pod + caramel espresso pod)Decaf Cappuccino (cappuccino milk pod + decaf espresso pod)Regular Coffee (as packaged)Cafe Ole (cappuccino or latte milk pod + regular coffee pod)Decaf Espresso (as packaged)Double shot half-caff espresso (one regular espresso pod, one decaf espresso pod)Double shot half-caff caramel espresso (one caramel espresso pod, one decaf espresso pod)EDITED 11/19/2013...1) I found two dark coffee pods that I enjoy as much as the Keurig Dark Magic... King of Joe Dark Roast, and Maxwell House French Roast.  Both are excellent and the Maxwell House is the least expensive of ALL the pods (SCORE!)2) I have the the PERFECT recipe for Cappuccinos and Lattes for the T55... Milk Pod press the (-) key on the unit; Espresso Pod press the (+) key on the unit.  This combo yields creamier milk and gives more coffee flavor to the drink.3) No regrets on switching whatsoever...

First I press the ""-"" to get a stronger brew, then press the button for five seconds to put a little more water in.3) TIP:  My tap water is really hard and descaling is a MUST.  I use a small amount of Lemishine dishwasher crystals to get the mineral deposits out of the machine.4) TIP:  You won't spill any water putting a filled tank in the back of the machine if you pay attention to the maximum water level.  If you do and you're still spilling, then you're angling the tank further than you need to.5) BB&B that certain store chain that sends 20% off coupons that don't expire has a nice selection of TDiscs at good prices (I go there if the Amazon price gets too high)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QAJ8JO6CH7XA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZVBZ8W#wasThisHelpful","R1QAJ8JO6CH7XA","A18FWPKVLW7RWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FWPKVLW7RWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had two Android smartphones in the past... 1) The original Motorola Droid & 2) The Droid Bionic.  Here's the stuff about Droid that drove me to Windows Phone 8...**Battery life - crazy bad to the point where I had to install the extended battery and cover (also true of my friend's Samsung phones).**Connection issues - 4G showing up in the display and the phone telling me during a navigation session ""Data Connection Lost"".  Really? I'm navigating somewhere... now what?**Random reboots - Oh yeah, never during a call but I'd be in the middle of web browsing session only to have the phone reboot itself.**Browser crashes - happened all the time.**4G to WiFi to 4G transition - a nightmare.  I'd have to turn off WiFi, wait a couple of seconds, and then turn it back on.**Bloatware and the inability to delete Verizon apps.  There were a LOT of unused apps, taking up space, that I would have loved to delete if I could.**Cost - $299 w/2-year contract renewal.Comparison to the Nokia 928**Battery life - you can't change the battery but you really don't have to.  It lasts all day with power to spare**Connection issues - there are none.**Random reboots - never happens.  As a matter of fact, I haven't had to manually reboot this phone for any reason whatsoever.**Browser crashes - none**4G to WiFi to 4G transitions - smooth as anything - there's no interruption in the data flow.**Bloatware - I actually LIKE the apps that came with this phone especially Nokia Drive, HERE Maps, HERE City Lens, and all the Nokia photo apps.  The one ""already installed"" app I wouldn't use, ESPN, was easily erased.**Cost - $99 w/2-year contract renewal.Notable features of the 928 & Windows Phone 8...Beautiful displayEasy OS - One screen for shortcuts (tiles) and one screen that lists ALL the programs.Great camera - pretty good low light photos, beautiful daytime photos, and a bunch of creative photo apps from Nokia that are fun and impressiveCall quality - very good; no complaintsProcessor speed - very smooth; no lagLive tiles - not the ""nightmare"" that I've heard of... some are kind of cool, some are functional.  All in all a nice feature to have.Navigation - works without an active data connection (map file is pre-installed).Apps - This seems to be a huge issue for some people.  Are there less apps available for WP8?, yes.  Do I care?, not really.  Why?, there really hasn't been an app that I wanted I couldn't find, or find an acceptable substitute.  I have Facebook, Skype, Open Table, Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, etc.  More apps are being made available daily.  I found a decent tip calculator, a Drop-Box & You-Mail interface that's fully functional, and a bunch of games.  I know there's a zillion apps for Android and Apple IOS, but most of them are crappy or repetitive (how many flashlight apps do you need anyway?).  Oh by the way, all the apps I downloaded and installed were freebies.Thing I don't like about the phone...**Volume control... there's seems to be one control that affects everything (ringer, notifications, alarm, media, etc.)  A minor annoyance, but I would like to have more controls.**No FoxFi (I didn't use free WiFi tethering THAT often, but now I'll have to deal with its absence).Conclusion...I don't miss the Android OS at all.  There were too many issues with it for me to continue using it.  I was waiting for this phone to come out on Verizon and I'm glad I did.  It's not perfect, but it works really well.  Even though there are less apps than Android, they seem to be better written (more polished, more functionality, etc.) and there hasn't been anything I needed or wanted that I couldn't find.  I can't believe I got this newly released phone for $99.If you're in the market for a new phone, don't listen to the FANatics, think for yourself, and take a good look at this phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD2MEAYD2ZSF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQAODG4#wasThisHelpful","RD2MEAYD2ZSF0","A18FWPKVLW7RWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FWPKVLW7RWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this pool relitively late in the summer, but I couldn't pass up a $[...] purchase (including tax and delivery) on a pool that others are selling for $[...].  I initially thought I'd just buy and store until next summer, but it was important to me to make sure everything was a-ok before the warranty expired.  Warranties start when you receive the item, not when you start using it.  So ... I decided to set it up and now I'm hoping for warm weather well into September.I've read reviews here on Amazon and at other places.  To anyone that put up this pool by themselves: Kudos!  I had someone help me and it took us just under two hours.  We were extra EXTRA careful to follow all the instructions and we took our time.  I'd recommend that you have at least 1-2 people on hand to help ... it will make installation much easier.Important thing I didn't know when I purchased the pool and planned the installation: If you're installing the pool on grass or ashphalt, Intex recommends that you place a 15""x15""x1.2"" steel, wood, or reinforced tile support pad under each U bracket.  With this pool that's 12 pieces.  Well, at Home Depot we realized our only choice would be to have a 2""x12""x8' piece of pressure treated wood cut into 12 equally sized pieces.  Not quite the 15"" that Intex recommends, but far better than using nothing.  Cost: $[...].  IMPORTANT:  The grain of the wood MUST be perpendicular to the support or it will split.  Now about the pool...Delivery: The delivery from Pilot Freight was on-time ... as a matter of fact, they came 1/2 an hour early.  Although it's curbside delivery, the two delivery guys brought the 300 lb. box to my backyard on request.  For that not so little 'extra',  they deserved an appropriate tip.Ease of Installation: 5-stars.  There's a lot of easy steps.  Also, there's an instruction book for EVERYTHING and they include two DVDs as well.Overall Quality: 5-stars.  The pool went together without any incidents at all.  Everything fit to-a-tee and worked as expected.  The filter/sanitizer combo is quiet and really pumps strongly.  The leaks around the fittings that I found were easily remedied by slightly tightening the connections (I didn't tighten them enough).  I found no leaks in the liner.Sturdiness: 4.75-stars. Once the pool is filled with water it's seems extremely sturdy although you shouldn't be concerned that the corners 'self-adjust' as you're swimming ... they're designed that way.  NOTE: The only thing that isn't sturdy is the ladder.  I wouldn't say it's flimsy, but it does shake a bit when using it so you need to be EXTRA careful going in and out of the pool.Package Completeness: 5-stars.  Everything is included to setup and use the pool except salt (you need three, 40 lb. bags to start - got at Home Depot), and the supports I mentioned.  The deluxe cleaning kit includes a skimmer unit, adjustable pole, vaccuum head, brush head, and leaf skimmer head.  It also comes with a debris cover that fits nicely on the top (and also heats the first couple of inches of water when left on in the sun), a Volley-ball set (I didn't bother with the Volleyball set ... It's still in the package), and a large but pretty thin ground cover.  There's also a ladder, which I already mentioned.Fun:  Yup, it's fun.  It was filled and being used in under 24-hours after receiving it.  Although it fits in my small backyard easily, it doesn't 'feel' small when swimming.  The combination of the 18' length and especially the 48"" depth makes it fell larger than it is.I'm VERY happy with this purchase.  I think with proper care, it should last many summers and honestly ... what's MORE fun in the summertime than a swimming pool?  This company makes owning a pool easy and does a great job in letting you know everything you need to make the experience even better.  I wish I had though about this three years ago when I bought my house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ZW0PHT922ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XU0IRW#wasThisHelpful","R38ZW0PHT922ND","A18FWPKVLW7RWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FWPKVLW7RWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased this watch this past Spring.  By the Summer, the screws holding the watch case to the bracelet came loose and the watch fell off my wrist while driving.  I was able to find most of it and sent it back to the mfg. for replacement.  The people at Timepieces International were very nice and I received my replacement after about six weeks (they were out of stock at the time).  The crown on the replacement however was bent and prevented me from screwing it down.  My third replacement had the same problem but only slightly, so I decided to keep it.There's no denying that the watch is beautiful and this one is acceptably accurate, but I've never had any watch ... not even a cheap 'gift with cologne purchase' watch just fall apart like this one.  My suspicion is that the movement may be Swiss, but even the Swiss make cheap movements.  Further the watch doesn't say 'Swiss Made' which leads me to believe that the watch, for all intensive purposes is actually Chinese.  I work quality for a cosmetic manufacturing company and the Chinese imported components I've seen are of such low quality, that needless to say I'm not a big fan of Chinese made goods.I do have to give kudos to customer service though ... they were very responsive, they didn't interrogate me about details of the problem, and they gave me accurate information about the turnaround time.I don't think I'll be buying any more watches from Timepieces International.  I have a couple of friends that have watches from them and they each have complaints (inaccurate, short battery life, etc.)  If I want a good cheap Swiss movement watch, I think I'll go with Invicta instead.  I own several and all have been problem free and their designs range from big chunky modern to classic 'Rolex Submariner' type and everything in between.Too bad too ... this watch line is extremely attractive to me but I can't get past the poor quality problem.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OCI0V0ZDZAAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Y8ADVO#wasThisHelpful","R2OCI0V0ZDZAAJ","A18FWPKVLW7RWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FWPKVLW7RWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free sample of this planter in exchange for a fair and honest review. I really like the size and color of the planter. There is an insert for the bottom so that your plant isn't sitting in a puddle of water, and a plug in the side so you can drain any excess water. Overall the planter is a great item for the price and I would highly recommend it. I currently have a spider plant in mine and in the spring I plan on purchasing several more for the porch to plant flowers in. I love the bright colors and the chain is strong and durable also. Definitely holds up to the amount of weight added with pottting soil and a plant.

"Hunting season has arrived, and it's no shave November... each year my husband insists he's going to grow a beard and each year he gets itchy and has to shave his face. He has had a goatee year round, but even that gets to a certain length and starts to itch and give him a certain amount of discomfort. When I was offered a sample of this item in exchange for a fair and honest review I jumped at the chance. I wanted to see my husband with a full beard, and he wanted to try it out because it was scent free and wouldn't interfere with his hunting. (yeah right) ;) Anyhoo, he's been using it every day for a little over a month, and he LOVES it. He hasn't shaved his face and he hasn't had the issues that he has in years past either. No bumps or itchy spots and he really does like that it isn't scented for when he wants too hunt. He's obsessed with smelling like dirt and mold when he walks in the woods. :( His beard is so soft it's unbelievable! We are both very impressed with the results of the beard oil and he says he's going to continue to use it, even after hunting season. Which means he can play Santa Claus this year too!

"This mask has been a lifesaver in the last several weeks since I received it free in exchange for a review. I quit smoking 5 weeks ago and believe it or not, it caused me to get the worst case of sinusitis that I've ever had. This mask has worked so well, I use it hot and cold to soothe the sinus headaches that I've been suffering from for a month, I don't like to take a lot of pills for pain, and while I wait for the antibiotics to kick in, this mask has been working great to ease the discomfort. I love how it conforms to my face and blocks out all the light and it's not so heavy that it hurts when added to the pressure from my sinuses. The scent isn't overpowering and I actually find it soothing also. I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from headaches, or sinusitis.

"These are great socks!! I received these socks in exchange for a fair and honest review approximately a month or so ago. I like to really try the products out before I leave my review, and thankfully this company is one of the companies who uderstands that and doesn't rush me to leave a review immediately!!l had my son test these socks out. He is truly rough on socks and I swear I should just take stock out in a sock company, but he was more than happy to be the sock guinea pig so this is what we found. These socks wear wonderfully, they don't slide off your foot, even when you're on the go from dawn til the wee hours of the next morning. He could wear them in regular tennis shoes and higher sneakers alike without fear of them sliding down or off his foot. They fit true to size, and were comfortable, nice and thick and stretchy. They washed up great. No fraying or holes, even after a month of washing. They came packaged nicely in a box, and I myself like that they are colored because even after more than a month of wear you can't tell that my son sometimes wears them with flipflops outside. They clean up great, hold up well to his rotten feet that seem to eat socks and he loves them. So the verdict would be that these are a bargain for the price, and great quality!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36K8BF0DEYPIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CKH36Y#wasThisHelpful","R36K8BF0DEYPIY","A6L46KJG3XQ7V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L46KJG3XQ7V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great bulb, I recently purchased a home and remodeled several rooms in the home and installed new lighting. Having purchased the lights without reading the boxes my husband didn't realize that we needed a specific type of bulb, and I just happened to have this particular bulb on hand, after I was offered a free sample in exchange for a fair and honest review. What a lifesaver!! The bulb fit the new light fixture perfectly and it lights the area of the upstairs hallway perfectly! It sheds just the right amount of light so that you aren't blinded, but can see the stairs to safely get up and down them. It has a nice golden light and isn't glaringly bright, even at it's brightest. I would highly recommend it, and I plan on purchasing several more since I have to have this particular shaped bulb for the new fixture.

"After more than 10 years my winter boots finally bit the bullet. The thinsulate was more thin than insulating, and they were starting to leak. They were no longer bugaboots, they were slush catchers. I needed something warm, and I needed them BEFORE the cold weather started! I have literally searched high and low for something stylish and warm, and this is what I chose.I LOVE these boots! They are comfortable, stylish and warm. The color is great, they weigh virtually nothing compared to my last pair of winter boots and I love that I can wear them all day without getting fatigued from the weight of the boot! Keen has definitely outdone themselves as far as I'm concerned. I will be treating them so that they don't get stained from salt and water, but other than that I'm confident that they won't leak.

This mouse is comfortable in your hand, and has nice rubber or silicone type grips on the sides that make it a nice firm grip. It slides nicely on a desk top and the wheel moves freely and doesn't catch too hard the way some can. I really like the face that the widget that you have to plug into your computer plugs into the bottom of the mouse too. My more expensive mouse didn't have that feature, so I had to seal it in a baggie when I replaced it so I didn't lose the little widget. :( I really love this mouse, and for the price of less than $9 you just can't go wrong!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30KGTLU3PODE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NBT7LI#wasThisHelpful","R30KGTLU3PODE8","A6L46KJG3XQ7V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L46KJG3XQ7V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sooo I have a couple of secrets I don't normally discuss in mixed company. So gents, leave the room. NOW. OK gals, here's the skinny. I have a hairy chin, I know, I know, you'd never have guessed it right? Seriously. I'm 45 and I have PCOS and hypothyroidism. The hair falls off my freaking head and grows on my chin at an abnormally fast rate. God hates me. It's just that simple. If he didn't hate me the hair would fall off my chin and grow on my head at an abnormally fast rate right?I received this mirror in exchange for a fair and honest review. I was so excited when I got home from hunting camp and it had arrived that I literally opened it right up, sat down and began plucking! Yes, real women pluck, yank and tweeze. Anyhoo, the mirror comes packaged in the box shown, nicely protected in thick foam. Very little assembly is required, you simply have to screw the base to the stand attached to the mirror and you are in business!I immediately sat down at the dining room table and used the bright afternoon light to get to work. After having been at camp with no tweezers for the weekend, I was in need of a good going over. I was absolutely SHOCKED at just how many hairs I had on my chin! I literally had a hundred! The 10X magnifier just amazed me at how much I could see! I was blown away at how well it worked with or without my glasses! I was easily able to find all the blonde and dark hairs alike without having to twist my head into contortionistic positions like I do in the bathroom mirror in order to get the right angle :( Plus I was much more comfortable sitting at the dining room table making my boarder watch me while he fixed his lunch. I invited him to join me, but he chose to eat in his room... his loss. I mean, it was dinner and a show as far as I was concerned. ;)As far as I'm concerned this mirror is worth every penny you'd pay for it. I have been using a 5x mirror that was my grandmother's for years and I'm amazed at the difference. I am seriously buying a couple of these mirrors for both of my hairy sisters for their Christmas gifts, and giggle if you will. I happen to know they will be their favorite gifts!

"I received this bag in exchange for a fair and honest review. I have to say, I literally LIVE out of my backpack. I have a job where I work out of three different offices and I have to haul a LOT of stuff around with me in order to ""feel"" like I'm not forgetting something. This includes my personal items. I have a ""touch"" of OCD and there are several must haves for me so that I can leave work and go to my work out also.This bag is PERFECT for work AND my work outs. It has two HUGE pockets that I can keep my personal and work items separate in, plus it came with a bag that I choose to use for my extra work out clothes, I throw my clean work out clothes in it every morning and leave it and my mat in my car, then use the bag with my personal and work items in it during the day, add my mat and work out clothes in the afternoon and I'm good to go! I love the two front pockets for smaller items like my keys, chapstick and cell phone so they don't get lost in the bigger pockets, and the side pocket really does hold a water bottle. It was a shock for me that it actually held the bottle instead of it falling out all the time! While I LOVE the little mesh pocket on the strap for my cellphone, I'm a terrible klutz, so I have a lifebox on my phone and it won't fit in the pocket, otherwise I'd keep my phone there! However, I do keep my business card holder in there, it fits perfectly and doesn't get lost in the mess of the big pockets!

"I received these socks free in exchange for a fair and honest review. With that being said, let me explain that I am not the most health conscious person in the world. It's not that I'm unhealthy, it's just that unless a zombie is chasing me, or there is only one beer left on earth I don't plan on EVER running if you get my drift.Sooo I get a new job this year. And part of this new job is discussing ""recovery"" with my peers and encouraging them to use healthy coping skills and such. Well... I'm not such a good role model now am I? So I decide to try yoga. And along come these wonderful socks at just about the right time, a couple of weeks after I sign up for my first yoga lessons. I figure if I'm going to have to preach to the choir, I might as well be able to say I tried to sing the songs right?These socks arrived about two weeks into my yoga experiment. Up to their arrival I had been using this yoga mat ""towel"" cover thingy that slipped and slid all over my mat while I was attempting to do the choking dog and the stroking out crane. ;) Did I mention I also quit smoking recently and nearly hocked up a lung trying to stretch into some of these positions? Anyhoo, using the towel thing was extremely dangerous for me. I don't know if it was dangerous because I'm a klutz or because I'm new to yoga, but I found these socks to be particularly helpful. They fit just fine and helped to keep me on my own mat rather than whomever had the misfortune of being next to me in class. And yes, I did end up on other people's mats several times, much to their dismay. It didn't bother me so much as them. I laughed heartily, them not so much :( The socks weren't so grippy that I wasn't able to easily switch positions, they were just right as a matter of fact! They weren't too loose, nor too tight on the toes, and they didn't slip off my ankles and down my feet either. I had worn some ankle socks the first time and actually lost one and never found it again. Seriously.I have since found that yoga is NOT my thing. The socks I enjoy immensely. I have moved on to PiYo, and the socks moved with me. :) I think the people of PiYo are much more forgiving of my klutziness and accepting of my ""dropping"" in during class into their personal space, and several have complimented my socks. ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG8JFDPAMURD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAHYZD2#wasThisHelpful","RG8JFDPAMURD6","A6L46KJG3XQ7V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L46KJG3XQ7V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She went to the local grocery store looking for them and was VERY disappointed when they had no idea what a goji berry was! I loved them too, I would have loved them even more had I been able to have five or six berries!! They really are delicious and I can see why she stole the bag!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KCVJFUZVOVFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWW3LQ6#wasThisHelpful","R2KCVJFUZVOVFW","A6L46KJG3XQ7V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L46KJG3XQ7V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never tried commercial cacao powder before, so when I was offered this product in exchange for a fair and honest review I jumped at the chance to sample it. I have to say that I was excited to try and I am not disappointed at all! I have used it in a variety of baking recipes, in milkshakes and smoothies also. It has yet to disappoint me!

"I love baking with cacao nibs, but anyone who regularly bakes with them knows that poor quality nibs, or stale nibs can make or break your recipe. These are some of the best quality, and best flavored nibs I've ever baked with. I've used them in a variety of baking recipes and tried them in my very first smoothie and I LOVE them! The flavor is bold without being overpowering. I have ordered some from other companies that have literally tasted like dirt and others that were alkaline tasting. These are by far my favorite and I will be ordering more in the future. I was offered these free in exchange for a fair and honest review, and I'm so glad I tried them.

"I was offered a free sample of these Chia seeds in exchange for a fair and honest review. I accepted because I had heard that chia seeds were high in magnesium and I suffer from strange cramps all over my body on a daily basis. I was quite excited to try these seeds and immediately began adding them to my morning yogurt along with my granola and fruit. I didn't mind the new texture, and I've come to enjoy the addition. After several days of consuming the chia seeds I began to notice fewer and fewer cramps also! When I say I was suffering from strange cramps let me explain. I would get charlie horse like cramps in my chin and neck, if I was carrying objects in my hand for more than a minute or two my thumb would lock up and start to twist towards my wrist, my toes would literally start to separate and curl UPWARDS. These were immensely painful and would cause almost contortionistic movements that I would have to strain to straighten out. So to not suffer from these anymore was more than relief, it was nirvana! I don't like using medications if I don't have to, so being able to add chia seeds to my diet makes me happy and confident that I'm doing something good for myself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJZPVIH67J40L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZYNGUS#wasThisHelpful","RJZPVIH67J40L","A6L46KJG3XQ7V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L46KJG3XQ7V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't looking to lose weight when I tried this MCT oil, I'm not over weight, and I normally have plenty of energy... I work in a psychiatric center and I literally walk about 6 miles a day while at work. I have adult ADHD, I'm sure you can only imagine how well that works at my job ;) I'm in a psychiatric center, I'm hyper and I can't concentrate :( Not a good combination to say the least. Anyhoo, I was offered a free sample of this product in exchange for a fair and honest review. Before accepting the product I did a quick bit of research on the product and saw that it had more than a few benefits to it. I'm very conscientious about what I put into my body. I have never medicated myself with psychotropic medications for my ADHD and I prefer to use all natural products and I avoid all foods with preservatives and dyes to control my ADHD. This product is purported to help with concentration, energy and weight loss. You may think I was crazy to try it when I'm already hyper but the results for me were phenomenal.I found that when I added a tablespoon of this to my yogurt, fruit and granola in the mornings I was more able to focus, remember things with out having to carry a list around with me and I actually had LESS energy spikes throughout the day. I was more level and able to perform my work duties without having to get up and move or bounce around like I normally do to release energy. I believe that this product helped to balance my hyperactivity, and kept me focused throughout the ENTIRE day. I was pleasantly surprised, as was my office mate! I went from constantly looking for the last thing that was in my hand or jumping up and moving around the office or running around the hospital to release some energy to being able to get some work done for extended periods of time and knowing exactly where EVERYTHING was!To date I haven't lost any weight, but that's absolutely fine by me, as long as I maintain my current weight I'm happy.

"Sooo I was offered these bulbs free in exchange for a fair and honest review. Here's the honest part. They are not at ALL what I expected. I thought they were to replace headlight bulbs. I know, I know, you're all thinking what an idiot right? Well I never claimed to be a rocket scientist. I thought they were the plug in thingy. I get so many offers for items for review that I had them confused. I did actually get some headlight things once and they kind of looked like these.So anyhoo, I got these and I was completely at a loss for what the heck I was going to do. I really take my free reviews to heart. I did not want to leave J&C hanging and not give them a fair review, and obviously I'm being completely honest. So I did some googling about what to do with these babies. Well lo and behold, I found out you can replace outdoor halogen bulbs with these things. I just happened to have unhooked two motion activated lights this summer because they were older and the trees constantly set them off and the cost was outrageous, even after adjusting them. So I thought, why not move them to a spot where the trees won't affect them, switch out the bulbs and rehook them up. I know, I know, now you're all asking how the girl who thought these were headlight replacements was able to accomplish that right? Well I didn't! hehe I had my husband and our boarder do it! Boo ya! I am smart enough to delegate the duties to those who have the proper qualifications ;)Fast forward a couple of weeks and we are in business! The lights work great, I even waited for an electric bill and there is barely a change! I was actually shocked at how easy it was for the guys to change these bulbs out for the halogens. I probably could have done it once they showed me what they did. Now I have a light that lights up the entire yard when I take the dog out at night, but doesn't go off when the wind blows and I learned that I should research strange offers before I accept them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F463ET2DAXKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XR9U0DS#wasThisHelpful","R1F463ET2DAXKT","A6L46KJG3XQ7V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L46KJG3XQ7V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will start off by saying that I have tried more than a few Insta Natural products and I've never been disappointed, and this one is no different! While I don't have a ton of wrinkles I am starting to get fine lines and I definitely have some darker spots on my face. I also have large pores and I have noticed a dramatic difference since I began using this product this summer. I have actually had coworkers ask me if I have started using different make up, if I had done something different with my hair, or if I was sleeping better. All have commented that my face looked brighter and that I do NOT look my age :) I'm about to turn 45 and one of my clients told me she guessed I was 28 last week! That was enough to convince me that this serum was doing it's job. I'm not one of those people who is fighting my age, but if something as simple as applying this serum makes people start to ask questions about why I look so good, then I'm not above using it every day!!How I use it:I remove my make up with a hypoallergenic make up remover cloth, I can't stand the oily residue it leaves behind so then I wash my face afterwards and I then apply the InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum. I know some folks have said they feel a sticky feeling, but I have had no such issues. I wait for it to dry before I put my glasses back on and I'm good to go ;) I love the fresh clean smell of the serum too. I do have chemical sensitivity issues and this product has never caused me any issues. In fact none of InstaNaturals products have, it's one of the reasons I love them so much!I highly recommend this product.

"I purchased a new house this year, with an inground pool. When I lived in my apartment across town I had lots of company for dinner parties, but ironically no one wanted to visit on sunny, hot days. What a turn around this year! The half acre yard was full to brimming with kids, adults, friends, family, neighbors and hangers on! Not that I mind, I love having company! However when people drop in at the last minute they rarely remember to bring important things like sunblock! While I had plenty of that on hand, people rarely remember to reapply it either!Enter Insta Natural Aloe Vera Gel!!! Seriously, this stuff was a life saver for at least 20 people this summer! I kept it in the cooler while everyone was over and as the burns happened we would apply it and soothe everyones hurts! This gel is hands down the BEST aloe gel I've ever had the pleasure of using. It's not thick, gooey or sticky the way many on the market are. Nor are there unneeded scents or ""cooling"" agents added. The consistency is just a tad thicker than water, it absorbs quickly and goes right to work. I have a LOT of chemical sensitivity issues with perfumes, detergents and the such and this gel worked great when I had a terrible reaction to wearing a new sunblock in the pool too! I ended up with a chemical burn and the aloe gel soothed it and took away the angry red and the sting. I also had a mishap with my new double oven and the gel worked great on that, no scar either! I really can't say enough about Insta Natural and their aloe gel. The price for this size bottle is half of what you'd pay for a comparable size of a name brand with perfumes and coloring at a drug store and in my opinion works twice as good without the added ick. I love that it comes with a pump, a screw cap and a push cap so you have three choices for dispensing the product too. I will definitely be investing in another bottle for next years pool season!I did receive a sample of this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20S8OXEMO8WXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X84YG3M#wasThisHelpful","R20S8OXEMO8WXO","A6L46KJG3XQ7V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L46KJG3XQ7V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review. I work in several office around my county and being on the road so much throughout the week often leaves me with a phone half charged, an ipod nearly dead and a kindle that's not able to download my latest purchase. Since I'm not supposed to have two of those three items in my office it's hard to charge them up for the places I am allowed to have them, when I'm in several offices in one day! After receiving this item I dropped it in my work bag and decided to bring it with me on the road the following morning. I have a port in my work car for this type of charger and I plugged all three items in to charge on my 40 minute commute to my first work site. My iPhone usually take at least that long to charge at home, and sometimes up to two hours to charge with the off name charger I picked up at Walmart for the car. Even with all three items charging my iPhone was nearly fully charged by the time my commute was done! I have to admit, I was mighty impressed!I would highly recommend this item for anyone who is on the road a lot and has multiple electronic items that need to be charged at once.

"Love the premise of this hat/earphone combo. My son was very excited to try it out and I immediately had him give it a go. I have a TON of hair and after trying the hat on, despite the fact that it fit I decided it was more for him than me. I found it a little uncomfortable for me. I couldn't get it to sit the way I wanted it to, I'm used to adjustable hats, but really it was more about my OCD than about the hat.Anyhoo, back to the hat/earphone combo, my son linked it up with his phone in a matter of seconds, he tells me that the sound quality is great and that the buttons are easy to use. He likes that the headphones are connected to the hat and can't be dropped while he's biking. He's had to swing back and retrieve his other wireless headphones a couple of times while on his bike, so this is an issue for him. He's even lost a set because someone saw him drop them and they swooped in and grabbed them before he was able to. He liked that the hat doesn't have a plastic adjuster near his ears, so he can wear it in cold weather without fear of his ears freezing too. He even sprayed the hat with a water repellant in hope that it would help in the rain. He rides his bike year round, so this will come in handy for him.He states that this is a great hat, with quality headphones and that for the price it's somethine he would have invested in for himself. The hat fit him comfortably and he states that it doesn't chafe, or make him sweat also.

"I love CoverGirl products and have used them for years, 28 years this Christmas to be exact ;) My first eyeshadows were a CG and a gift from my mom!I was drawn to these colors immediately and was excited to try them. I was very disappointed with the lack of pigment however. I used primer prior to applying, and despite this after applying all the colors were so similar there was really not enough contrast to make them ""strikingly"" different once they were out of the compact and on my eyes. Once applied the shimmer is more pronounced than the pigment is and I'm just not impressed with this particular set. Perhaps if the colors were matte, or had less shimmer I'd be more impressed.

"Many folks find discussing their intimate toys intimadating. I find it liberating, especially at the airport when my suitcase is being explored rather thoroughly by the TSA and gentleman who finds my intimate toy is too embarassed to continue searching my bag and steps away and asks his partner to continue the search. I immediately begin discussing the merits of said aid with the fine TSA agent and she jumps right into the conversation and begins asking questions! I kindly let her know that this is hands down one of the better aids I have owned, I love the fact that it's quieter than most of the items I've purchased in the past and it's waterproof so ""Pete"" as I've named him can join me in the shower or bath. ;) He's soft to the touch, and not in that icky way that the older models were where they would get sticky after one wash, despite using the correct cleaning agents. I shared with her that Pete has a variety of pulses and intensities and his batteries last forever, unlike a typical male hehe. This definitely made her male partner blush. I told her how he came in a cute little gift box with an included velveteen bag that I had obviously forgotten at home, or he wouldn't have poked his purple head out of my side pocket announcing his presence to the world. After several awkward minutes for her partner the nice TSA lady helped me repack my bag and asked where I had gotten my partner Purple Pete the Warlord and I explained I had gotten free in exchange for a fair and honest review, but that she could purchase hers here on Amazon. We both agreed that for the price on here, compared to other places Pete was a cheap date!In all seriousness though, after having my secret friend exposed in such a public way, I can honestly say that this unit really is one of the better ones for the price.

"I love, love, love silicone pastry sheets! I bake a LOT and while I don't mind using parchment paper, I would really rather use something that I can throw in the dishpan and use over and over again!

I use them often to roll out biscuit dough, cut out cookies and and knead bread to safe scraping my counter top too. I use them on my half sheet instead of parchment paper for certain recipes, others just don't crisp up the way I like when I use silpal sheets, but you'll have to judge for yourself which you want to use them for and which you don't. We all have different preferences. I love these sheets much better than several other sheets that I've paid a LOT of money for, just because of the measured circles on them.

"My favorite feature of these child cabinet locks is that I didn't have to keep opening the cabinet for my husband!! We had previously tried a set of cabinet locks from Walmart, that were name brand and kind of expensive, and he couldn't work the things. I was always having to get up, go into the kitchen and open cabinets for him. Seriously.These are easy enough for the husband to use, but confusing enough for the kids to not be able to figure out.

"I absolutely LOVE these latches! I have four nieces and nephews that visit often and they are all under the age of 6. I have used one lock each on my refrigerator, a freezer, a cooler we use near the pool and my screen door that leads to the pool. Believe it or not, they worked equally well on each item! With a house that previously didn't need to be baby proofed I was in a dither to make sure we were safe when the kids came over. We often babysit and to be honest we just weren't prepared to have four toddlers in a house with so many every day items that they want to get into or out to! The refrigerator is a never ending source of snacks and drinks, and the freezer is a matching upright so they assume it too holds drinks and snacks. The cooler holds the drinks near the pool and they are always wanting to help themselves and of course they always want to go out to the pool when you aren't looking! While the latches weren't specifically advertised for doors, it works great to keep ours from opening when the kiddies are here and gives us a few extra seconds to catch up to them and reroute them back to a safe zone! Well worth the price, and I will be ordering more of these latches for more applications before the next babysitting adventure.

"In theory this item is great, hook a fob to your keys, phone, purse or whatever you lose frequently and find it with the main key fob by pushing the button associated with the lost item. In practice the item isn't so great. The smaller fobs are nearly impossible to turn to the on position. In fact I was afraid I would break the ""on"" switch off the fob when I turned it to the on position. There are no assigned buttons to each fob and the directions are spotty at best. I have yet to be able to figure out how to configure the smaller fobs in order to use them. I will revise my review when I am able to figure the items out, if I'm able to.

"I have used other touchless soap dispensers in the past, the type you have to purchase special soap inserts for. While I like the convenience of the no touch dispensers, I HATE having to pay upwards of $3.50 for the tiny amount of soap you get with their inserts!I was offered this item in exchange for a fair and honest review and I jumped at the chance! I have to say that I am VERY impressed with the dispenser. It comes with a tray so you can mount it on the wall, and I immediately mounted it in my TINY downstairs bathroom on the wall. What a joy to not have a soap dispenser constantly falling into the sink, or a bar of soap melting all over the tiny vanity that's in that bathroom! This dispenser works GREAT! It takes 4 AAA batteries and holds a HUGE amount of soap. I filled it with my favorite liquid soap and it dispenses just the right amount! I love that the wall mounted tray has a spot that catches any drips in case you pull your hand away too quickly too! It's great for when the little ones are over, as they often to pull their hand away to quickly.I HIGHLY recommend investing in one of these high quality soap dispensers rather than wasting your money on name brand soap inserts for the other automatic dispensers!

He uses only one at a time, so while he's ""killing"" one he has another one ""juicing"" up. He really liked the extra USB ports and thought they were a great addition to the unit. He also states the sound of the fans isn't ""distracting"" at all.Let me take a moment to point out that I could run through the house on fire and naked and not distract him from his games. I have literally stood three free from him and told him ""Dinner is ready"" repeatedly for 15 minutes in three languages and haven't been able to distract him. I have carried on one sided conversations with him about the pros and cons of granny panties and not distracted him.

"I bought this strop from the Knives Plus website sometime back and I've gotten great use from it.  A little expensive as sold through Amazon but it's really an excellent strop.  I've used it for more than a year and bought a second to keep in my RV.  It's well made with soft leather glued permanently to a piece of lightweight wood composite with melted polishing compound and oil impregnated into the leather.  The green polishing compound puts a fine mirror polish on the edge of my knives.  If the leather starts to dry out, rub a little olive oil onto the surface and let it absorb.  It's back to new again.You can make your own strop from an old leather belt or scrap leather glued to a board but this is the easy way to get a quality leather strop.  A mirror edge is not needed for all knives (depends on the steel and the job you're doing) but for those that can benefit from a stropped edge, the Knives Plus Strop Block is one of the easiest ways to get there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2869CLYRK1GOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010C7WBDE#wasThisHelpful","R2869CLYRK1GOH","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a gritty adult Western drama that seems semi realistic.  The cast is impressive and the story gets off to a running start.

I'm not offended by nor do I shy away from obscene language.  But, really, this crap is over the top.  No character in this series seems to be able to carry on a conversation without using a half dozen obscenities or repeating variations of f*** three or four times per sentence.  The action takes place in the 19th Century in the Dakota Territories, not in a 21st Century inner city with background rap music and gang banger babble.

"Surprisingly good knife in almost every respect.  I bought one of these around the same time as I bought a Benchmade Stryker with the drop point blade.  The Stryker cost over 50% more than the HK Axis model yet the knives seem to me to be nearly equal.  The HK is even a little heavier duty with a thicker blade, D2 steel and heavier Axis lock components.  If Benchmade sold these as ""Benchmade"" instead of ""HK"" the pricing would be significantly higher.The only apparent nod to economy in this model is the spine of the knife was left rough and unpolished prior to applying the black coating.  It has no bearing on function and it is hardly noticeable.  Straight from the box, the pivot was a little rough as well.  I washed it in hot water and dishwashing detergent, using an old toothbrush to get into the lock and pivot area.  After it dried, I used a Q-tip with oil and lightly lubed the blade tang, pivot and Axis lock.  The HK pivot smoothed out and has been as smooth in opening/closing as any other Benchmade ever since.  The knife was sharp on arrival but not as sharp as I like.  Most people would be thrilled with Benchmade's edge grind.  I improved on the factory edge with Spyderco ceramic stones and a leather strop loaded with green polishing compound.  D2 steel is hard stuff.  It holds an edge well but it's slow to return to sharpness when dull.  I like it but I know how to sharpen stuff.  If you're not good a sharpening you can always use Benchmade's Lifesharp service..  But you have to ship off your knife to take advantage of the free sharpening.  My advice:  learn to sharpen your knives yourself.One other point.  Every Axis lock knife I've owned has eventually developed a loose pivot.  According to Benchmade Company, they purposely make the pivots loose so the owner can adjust the deployment tension to suit themselves.  The owner will need to remove the pivot screw, put a drop of Loctite (I suggest either blue or purple) on the screw threads, adjust the tension to preference and let the Loctite set up for about 12 hours.  Once this is done, the pivot is unlikely to need further attention.  Of course, if you prefer to do so you can just retighten the pivot as it loosens.Really a good knife for a hundred bucks.  I'd dock it 1/2 star for the unfinished look of the blade spine but otherwise it's a 5-star piece of cutlery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQAGX337G4BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJWR32E#wasThisHelpful","R2JQAGX337G4BS","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice looking shoe.  Appears to be well made and I like the styling a lot--understated solid white with a wonderful, non slip gum rubber sole.  A little squeaky at first but that stopped after one day of wearing.I went by the Amazon recommendation for sizing but had to go up a size to a 13.  Amazon's fit computer recommended a 12.5 but the shoe doesn't come in a 12.5 size.  Much too big.  Returned the 13 and ordered a 12.  Fit is okay although kinda narrow--but I have fairly wide feet.  Most brands of sneakers have to be ordered a size larger than I normally wear to accommodate my wider feet.  My normal shoe size is 11EE but I have to order a 12 in sneakers that only come in medium widths.  If a 12.5 was available in these Romas, they would probably give me a smidgeon more toe room but, honestly, the size 12 fits pretty close to my normal size 11 in length, just a little tight in the width.Wish more sneaker makers would offer widths in their shoes.

"I have both the satin, plain edge and the black, partially serrated models of this knife.  They are very good knives overall and I have only one major complaint which I'll get into later.I'm a Spyderco fan and the hole in the blade is very familiar to me.  The Pika II also shares the nested full steel liner design used in several fiberglass reinforced nylon handled Spyderco models.  It's also a back/mid lock design--shades of the Delica/Endura, etc.  The Pika II is a Chinese made knife whereas most of the core traditional models from Spyderco are Japanese in origin.  The Pika II blade is 9Cr13 steel where Spyderco uses VG-10.  Of course, the Pika II is NOT a Spyderco.  It's a Benchmade brand.  Being made in China, Benchmade is able to market these knives at a much lower price than their US production.  I must say, I'm impressed with the design and build of these knives.  I like the blade shape and grind--it reminds me of the sadly discontinued Benchmade AFCK--and the odd looking grip pattern seems effective enough to keep the knife in your hand during chores.  The grind is a hollow saber type with a nice swedge that adds to the aesthetics.  The blade is very pointed and thin at the tip, a design that makes for good penetration but perhaps a little fragile for some aggressive users.  The handle is very ergonomic and it's long enough for a solid grip.  The Pika II allows tip up or down carry for both right and left handers with the moveable pocket clip.  I like the clip a lot.  It's effective without being overly strong and the design is pleasing to the eye and solid.  The finish of the blade on both the black and satin knives is virtually flawless--well polished in the satin and uniformly coated in the black model.Okay then.  Is this the perfect folding knife?  Not quite.  While there are lots of very good to excellent points to these knives, both of them share one major fault.  They are both difficult to open one-handed.  Loosening the pivot and adding a drop of oil does nothing to help.  I initially thought a little wearing in would fix the problem as it has done in other back lock knives I own.  Well, it helped a bit but it has not resolved the issue.  Apparently the pivot area is not among the most smoothly polished surfaces on the planet and the back lock spring is very stiff and strong.  A little playing around with finger placement when opening the knives helps with leverage but they are VERY stiff and not easy openers at all.I like these knives despite the stiff opening issues.  If a little better finishing in the pivot area and a little less strong springing in the lock were used, these could be outstanding knives in their price range.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20CWR037TF5CP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CQYEX6#wasThisHelpful","R20CWR037TF5CP","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right after I bought the satin blade version of the 710, I found a black coated, partially serrated edge version being sold as ""used"" by a dealer.  The knife really wasn't used, it was brand new and appeared to be a demonstration model or a sample that had been sold and returned.  Generally, I prefer non-serrated edges on white blades but the price was too good to pass up and, besides, I had already bought the satin, plain edge 710.  Initial examination showed the black blade was a hair off-center but this didn't bother me much considering the price.  As is often the case with Axis lock Benchmades, the pivot loosened in short order.  A little Loctite applied to the pivot screw threads with a toothpick fixed that immediately.  Since I got the knife for such a good price, I decided to carry it as a ""beater"" model and subject it to every type of use and abuse while saving the satin 710 for future uses.  Over the relatively short period I've owned this knife, it's been a slicer, trimmer, chopper knife as well as a light duty pry bar and screw driver.  The black coating on the blade has worn significantly and the G10 has picked up a few minor scars--both conditions were expected given the treatment the knife has been subjected to.  The knife is holding up perfectly and I'm more than satisfied.  In fact, this ""bargain beater"" 710 has become one of my favorite and most used knives.While D2 steel is noted for being a bear to sharpen, it holds a sharp utility edge for a long time without dulling.  I can sharpen it to hair splitting sharpness but such a fine edge is a bit fragile for most of the cutting tasks I've performed with this knife.  That small serrated section of the blade really makes some tough cutting a lot less tough.  I make sure I don't use up the edge completely before resharpening, otherwise it's a slow process to bring a D2 edge back from dull.  The 4"" blade is a bit longer than I'm used to but the knife carries as easily as any 3.5"" model I own.  I also really like the narrow blade profile that adds to the ease of carry.  Overall, this is one versatile pocket knife.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34VNXHTGHXSK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013AS0K8#wasThisHelpful","R34VNXHTGHXSK9","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good, heavy denim material with plenty of stitching.  Should hold up to heavy use.  The biggest negative for me is the baggy fit and the overly long inseams.  Like all denim, it will stretch as the pants are worn.  Normal fit jeans stretch to fit better after wearing a while but these full fit jeans already fit loose and the stretching just makes them looser and baggy.  I have to tighten my belt a notch to hold them in place.  Plus they are too long...they pool up around my ankles and drag the floor with flat soled shoes.  This gets worse with extended wearing.  Fresh out of the dryer, they fit much better.For general wear, I think I will stick to relaxed or traditional fit jeans.  The loose fit Carhartts are a little too loose for me.  If you're buying for use on the job site and want the loose fit, order them shorter than normal or be prepared to roll them up or cut them off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HUKZ8CS6MOC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002G9UDGY#wasThisHelpful","R1HUKZ8CS6MOC8","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm kind of a Spyderco guy.  I own a number of them and I consider Spyderco some of the best knives and most appealing designs on the planet.  Benchmade makes good knives and I own several of them as well.  But only few Benchmade models really appeal to me.  The 710 is one that does.  I'm glad to report that I am not disappointed with my recent purchase of the 710.Lots of good things to report here.  D2 steel is good stuff.  Not stainless steel but it's ""near"" stainless due to the high chromium content.  It is rust resistant but real corrosion requires neglect on the owner's part.  D2 will stain with use over time.  D2 steel is hard and some people just cannot get the hang of sharpening it.  The secret is patience and persistence and maybe the judicious use of diamond stones.  Best idea:  don't let it get dull to begin with.  I use Spyderco's ceramic stones and keep my knives sharp and DMT diamond stones to bring them back to sharpness.  But the 710 came surprisingly sharp to begin with so normal touch ups should be all that's necessary for a good while.The handle is G10 and I like it.  It's not aggressively textured but it's not slippery either.  The Axis lock is strong.  Sometimes a spring will break in the Axis lock but it's not a common occurrence.  Opening the knife is silky smooth.  The shape of the handle is excellent--narrow, thin and well shaped.  The blade is 4"" long which is a bit longer than I usually like to carry.  However, the blade manages to fit into a handle of a length you usually find on a knife with a 3.5"" blade.  Since the whole package is thin and narrow, this knife carries so easily it doesn't feel like a 4"" knife in your pocket.  Just be aware that a 4"" knife might not be legal to carry in some of the places you frequent.As for negative points, there is only one I've identified--a complaint fairly common to Benchmade knives with Axis locks.  To clarify, I actually own two Benchmade 710's.  My other is a partially serrated, black coated blade model.  I bought it about the same time as the plain satin blade model.  Although I like the looks of the satin model better, I've been carrying the black model daily for about a month.  It gets a lot of frequent use.  It's kind of a beater knife since I bought it new as an ""open box"" deal for a good discounted price and I don't mind using the heck out of it.  The main concern I've found is how the pivot gets loose with the frequent opening and closing this knife goes through.  The issue is not a deal breaker because it is completely resolved with ease.  To do so, follow this procedure:  Back out the pivot screw with a Torx wrench until a good bit of the threads are visible.  Wipe off any excess oil with a Q-tip.  Apply a drop of Loctite to a toothpick and apply the Loctite to the pivot screw threads--a drop or two should be enough.  Tighten the screw until the blade has the amount of tension you like and let the knife set up until the Loctite dries.  Once this is done, the pivot screw should no longer loosen with normal use.The 710 is a smooth operating knife that keeps getting smoother as you use it.  Aesthetically, it looks good and it's not as threatening-looking as many 4"" knives.  (Of course, some people feel threatened by anything sharp and pointed so this point is subjective.)  It feels comfortable in >my< hand and fulfills >my< needs well.  It's expensive, yeah.  If you can justify the expense and want a high quality knife, I highly recommend the 710,","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13V1SJMGZSL9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FJOTB2#wasThisHelpful","R13V1SJMGZSL9S","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My introduction to Marvel Mystery Oil came about in the 1960's.  My mother's Ford Galaxy 500 developed noisy valves and rough idle.  My mom was worried something major was wrong with the engine.  I took it to the dealership for her but the head mechanic (we called them ""mechanics"" back in the 60's, not ""technicians"") told me to buy a bottle of MMO and give it a try.  He said he could repair the engine but it would be costly and he thought MMO would do the same thing for a couple of bucks.  I did as he said and the engine smoothed out and quieted down almost immediately.  I've been a believer ever since.My current vehicle is a diesel Ram 3500.  I add a few ounces of MMO and Power Service Diesel Kleen every time I fill up.  The truck is over 10 years old now and runs perfectly.  I also noticed an improvement in mileage when I started using my additive cocktail.It may not cure the common cold or make you head of the class but this stuff does a pretty good job of cleaning the engine and fuel system of vehicles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MJ2A3VWNA7Y0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009JKGJW#wasThisHelpful","R1MJ2A3VWNA7Y0","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In 2015, television can boast of the finest productions in its history.  There is outstanding writing, acting and production that, in the past, was only seen on the big screen.  Indeed, movies seem stuck in the mire of special effects and computer generated imaging having forsaken all semblance of creative substance.  Yes, TV is the current bastion of quality dramatic productions.  But ""Texas Rising"" is not one of them.I looked forward to watching this mini-series on the formation of the Great State of Texas.  But early into the first episode, I was confounded by the worst writing and acting I've witnessed on a purported ""major"" production.  Nevertheless, the DVR continued to record this POS and I continued to watch the train wreck for the sheer entertainment value of pure incompetence.Being of the Baby Boom generation, I've been subject to the history of Texas in various forms for decades.  Most of it was from movies and TV and books of fiction and I'm sure most of it has been myth.  But all this exposure has led to some familiarity with the core facts involved.  I'm also very familiar with the geography of Texas, having spent a great deal of time visiting most of the areas of the state over many years.  I wish the people involved in ""Texas Rising"" had spent a little time becoming familiar with the state before rushing into making this travesty.History is frequently twisted by poetic license.  I can accept that a dramatic presentation of an historical event will contain fictional elements.  But the writers who came up with the peripheral characters and events in ""Texas Rising"" just recycled writing elements that I thought had been tossed out in the 1980's.  The characterizations are so stereotypical and predictable it adds to the whole comic atmosphere of incompetence.  As for the truly historical characters portrayals, the writers apparently felt the legends and myths surrounding these real people has more validity than their actual lives.  Take Emily West, for instance.  History indicates Ms West was an indentured servant of mixed race who was held captive by the Mexican army as it was engaged in the fight with the Texas rebels.  The writers of ""Texas Rising"" turned her into a former New Orleans whore who spied for Sam Houston (her lover) by becoming the mistress of Santa Ana.  This, of course, should make for interesting theatre but, instead, made for a series of totally unbelievable episodes without really adding anything to the plot.While some have criticized the acting, I'm going to cut them some slack here.  The cast seems to just be crew members of a sinking ship.  They're doing their job as best they can so they can draw their paychecks, hit the life rafts and make it home intact.  This is a truly awful production but most of us have worked at bad jobs before.  We did it for the pay, not the satisfaction of performing an important role in life.  It's an embarrassment to the actors because their faces and performances are on display.  That's sad because there wasn't much they could do with this wretched job to make it better.The real stake through the heart of ""Texas Rising"" is the locale.  All the action for the events portrayed happened in Southern and Southeastern Texas.  This is not desert country.  Repeat >NOT< desert.  This is really a geography of lowlands, bayous, coastal plains and woodlands.  At the Battle of San Jacinto, Santa Ana was trying to escape through a swamp when he was captured by the Texas army.  San Jacinto is adjacent to the current city of Houston and this is NOT in the desert.  But ""Texas Rising"" was filmed in Mexico and in the Mexican desert.  In ""Texas Rising"", Santa Ana is captured while meandering around boulders through dry, rocky terrain.  The rationale for the shooting location is beyond me.  Again, this adds to the comical ineptness of the whole production.In summary, ""Texas Rising"" is truly an awful mini-series and a waste of all the resources used for the production.  It's a great example of incompetence and, if for no other reason, it might be worth watching just to see how not to do this type of work.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WHY1AL6C1W5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPH4RUM#wasThisHelpful","R1WHY1AL6C1W5U","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Henley collar T-shirts are typical of traditional original fit Carhartt work clothing--well made and cut full and loose to allow non-binding movement.  I've been a buyer of the standard Carhartt T-shirts for quite a while now and these Henley models are the same cut and fabric.  I love the knit fabric weight and the way they fit.  Generally, I buy T-shirts a size up from my normal size to allow for shrinkage over time and due to my dislike for clothing that clings and binds.  Fact is, I probably wouldn't have to do that with these shirts since they're already a little over-sized to begin with.  If you prefer a tighter fit in your T-shirts, go down one size.  As for shrinkage over time, there's not really much to speak of.  They shrink a little but not a full size.I wear black T-shirts almost exclusively.  They don't show soiling as easily as lighter colors and they go with any other color perfectly, looking nice under a casual sport shirt.  The Carhartt black shirts will fade over time with normal laundering.  They seem to fade a bit more than other brands I've owned but I don't mind this.  The older shirts just get worn when I'm doing the dirtiest chores, the newer shirts for light tasks for just hanging out.  If you can't abide fading, don't get the black shirts or just buy something else with polyester in the fabric.Where the Henley collar T-shirt really comes into it's strength is in the heat.  It's been in the mid to high 90's around here with humidity well above the 50% level.  A standard T-shirt with its tight knit collar can become a bit warm due to trapping body heat.  Unbuttoning the Henley collar on this loose-fitting Carhartt shirt allows a little more air circulation for cooling.  It's not Carrier air conditioning cool but it's a help when you're outside in the hot weather.I haven't found another brand of knit cotton shirt with the quality of fabric and fit that compares to Carhartt's Work Wear.

"This is my third pair of Mexico 66s.  I really love these shoes, especially when I can find them at a good price.Why do I like them so much?  First of all, they are a little wider in the toe box than many other athletic shoes.  Since I have wider feet, they fit me more comfortably than the medium width of other companies.  They're not New Balance or Ascis wide but the Onitsuka ""medium"" is not really narrow like some sneaker brands.  I wear an 11 in street shoes but I take an 11.5 to 12 in sneakers.  With the Onitsukas, I go with a 12 although I think an 11.5 might fit okay.  Twelve is a little too long for my feet but it allows plenty of room for my toes to wiggle around.  I also like the soft, thin leather that quickly conforms to the shape of my foot.  They are comfortable without having a lot of padding or excess material in the upper.  The thin sole contributes to the feeling of being barefoot but it protects the bottom of the foot well.  They offer some arch support but mostly they are flat soled shoes for normal feet.  The insole is glued in place but it could be ripped out and replaced if desired but it would be better to just buy a different shoe if you plan to do that.  These shoes are lightweight and feel insubstantial, however, they seem to handle wear very well.  They also look nice.  These are not overbuilt athletic shoes, they are comfortable everyday sneakers with a retro look.The downside is the price unless you find them at a bargain in your size and an agreeable color.  Amazon has been a good source for me to find Tigers without spending a fortune.  The only other downside I can think of is the fact that the thin sole means some of my pants run a bit long and drag the ground when wearing these shoes.Sometime back in the late 1970s, I had a pair of Adidas Samoas that I dearly loved.  The Mexico 66 shoes remind me of those old Adidas as far as looks and design philosophy.  I have the current Samoas and they are like the originals in name only.  Today's Samoa is made of synthetic leather with a thick, built-up padded sole and thick insole and a huge, ugly toe bumper.  They're not bad shoes but the best Adidas Samoas  you can get today are the Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 models.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T3NLS225ZGIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOZY21S#wasThisHelpful","R1T3NLS225ZGIO","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It doesn't stop our pup from pulling but it does stop choking her when she pulls.When the leash was attached to the two separate points (shoulder and chest rings), our puppy immediately figured out how to defeat the set up by wrapping her front legs around the leash and refusing to walk at all.  We then just used the double leash attached at the shoulder point and let her pull.  At least now she wasn't choking herself and possibly damaging her throat.  Over time, maybe--just maybe--she pulls a little less but that could just be her maturing.  She is, after all, a puppy getting used to walking on the leash.Our dog is a medium sized breed but, being a puppy right now, we got the small size with the intention of buying the medium size if it works okay.  Actually, the small size appears to be the better choice even for an adult of her breed.  As she has grown, we have adjusted the harness and there's still plenty of adjustment left to go.  She is not expected to get much larger than she is now (at seven months) so the small size is probably the best choice.It's a little difficult to adjust the harness to fit properly, especially at the beginning.  Once you figure it out and get it properly adjusted, it fits well and further adjustments are relatively easy.  Our dog is a growing puppy and a few adjustments have been necessary over time.  If your dog is a fidgety little terrier like ours, putting it on can be frustrating since the bottom strap can flip upside down or twist and prevent the clips from attaching.  Pay careful attention and save the frustration.  One thing I like about this harness is that it doesn't tangle the dog's hair as it tightens.  In the past, we've tried other harnesses that would leave the dog's hair tied in knots after every walk due to the movement of the straps.I've found a longer leash works better with our dog than using the double leash included with the harness.  You can, of course, just use the included leash by clipping one end to the harness and one end to the handle, thereby making it double length.  The longer leash thing may just be unique to me and my puppy, however.  I don't do ""heel""--I'm not fond of having my dog underfoot when walking and I prefer the dog walk in front.  If that's a bad training technique, so be it.  My dog, my preference.This harness is a little better than just ""okay"".  I like that my puppy is no longer choking but, really, it hasn't had much effect on her pulling the leash.  I give it 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38MZ0DT6IE55X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OQ35SE#wasThisHelpful","R38MZ0DT6IE55X","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are very nice little compacts.  They're not as difficult to use as others I've tried.  The problem I have with compacts is the eyepiece (ocular) lenses are always small with a very narrow beam of light and these eyepieces have to be placed and held directly over the center of the eye.  Higher power compacts such as the 8x21 and 10x21 models are virtually impossible for me to use since that beam of light is even narrower.  The 6.5x Papilios are a bit brighter and easier on my eyes.  To anyone who hesitates due to the lower magnification, don't sweat it.  A 6.5 magnification is pretty decent and it's easier to hold steady, especially compared to 10 power models.  I doubt you'll see much difference between a 6.5x and a 7x.Their claim-to-fame is that the Papilios focus very close, necessary for butterfly and insect watching, but handy also for birding.  Take it from someone who has done birding with the venerable old Leitz Trinovid 10x40 models in the past.  Those binoculars had a ""close"" focus of about 25 feet and that can be a handicap when birding in deep woodlands.  The old Trinovids were superb for open country but too claustrophobic in tight spaces.To my eyes, the optical quality of the Papilios is just fine.  They're sharp with good contrast and a pleasing color rendition.  These binoculars are lightweight, perhaps a bit too lightly built.  They appear to be all plastic construction with a rubbery gripping surface that allows good handling.  They are small binoculars so that means there's not that many places to put your fingers.  Those with large hands might find them difficult to manipulate until they adjust to this small size.  I was a little surprised at how loose they are.  The focus knob and the body hinge are quite loose and a little bit too easy to adjust, in my opinion.  I'd like these controls to be stiffer so you don't inadvertently change the settings.  Eye relief is just enough for me as an eyeglasses wearer but there's no eye relief to spare.Overall, nice binoculars but I wouldn't want them to be my only binos.  They're not good for low light and they probably won't handle the banging around most binoculars get during normal use.  For those uses you really should have standard size binoculars in your choice of magnification, either porro prism or roof prism.  The Papilios are good for travel, to keep in your vehicle or to back up the main binocular.  As a compact, I really like them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AG5446HTF4TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKO4A8Q#wasThisHelpful","R2AG5446HTF4TX","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a fan of the series so I had to order this shirt considering the low price.  It's a decent T-shirt at a decent price.  Nothing special as far as fabric is concerned--pretty thin, lightweight.  Others advised it runs small so I ordered considerably larger than my normal size to allow for being undersized and for shrinkage.  And it does shrink.  Order large.  If you're really tall, you might want to forego this shirt because it shrinks a lot in length after several washes.

"Spyderco simply makes excellent knives in a wide range of designs.  The Native Lightweight has a lot going for it as a daily carry--thinner profile than most Spydercos, light in weight and highly useful blade shape and design.  While this is one of the pinned models, there's no reason to fear the design over the screwed-together models.  I own 20+ year old Spydercos that are of the pinned design and they continue to be as tight as the day I bought them despite daily use for a number of years.  This Native model is silky smooth in opening and closing.  It came with a bit of a glitch in the lockup.  It locked tight but the lock bar would catch on the back of the blade tang a little bit.  That resolved with using it and frequently opening and closing it.  It wore in nicely and it's now as perfect a fit as possible.Design-wise, the Native has been around for a long time.  I have an old Native III with a serrated edge.  It's about 10 years old.  It was made in Japan with VG10 blade and a contoured grip instead of the now-standard flat grip design.  It also had one of the early wire clips that I never liked much.  I never used the Native III a lot because I didn't find the serrated edge as useful as a plain edge for everyday tasks.  The contoured grip was also a little to fat in my pocket.  The current Native production is in Golden, Colorado.  The blade steel is now S30V, hollow ground, and the FRN handle is flat with a spiderweb-like Bi-directional grip surface.  Thankfully, the clip is now flat metal instead the original wire design.  One of the features I have always liked about the Native is the swedging of the blade--it looks nice.  The thin profile (compared to most other Spyderco models) doesn't take up a lot of room in my pocket.Of all the Spyderco knives I've owned, the Gayle Bradley and the Dragonfly have been my absolute favorites, both worthy of 5 stars.  I own multiple samples of both models.  I've not owned the Native as long as the other two models but it is proving itself daily.  The size is just about right--smaller, lighter and easier to carry than the Bradley yet larger and capable of a wider range of tasks than the Dragonfly.  There's no reason not to give it 5 stars, even at this early stage of ownership.The only problem is the model has been discontinued.  It is being replaced with the Native 5 Lightweight, a screwed-together design with a full flat ground S35V blade.  The swedge that gives the Native a distinctive and custom look is now sadly gone.  These changes are considered upgrades and I will likely buy one of those as well since the overall design has so much going for it.  However, the standard Native will remain one of my favorites, especially due to the now sadly departed swedging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U1HWCUZ5UWZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002IO16E#wasThisHelpful","R1U1HWCUZ5UWZA","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought both a 7K and 8K to give the Emerson design a try rather than buy one of the expensive Emerson-built folders.  Glad I did because the design does zero for me.  I don't like the disc or the wave opening and the chisel grind on the 8K just sort of escapes me as to the ""why?"".Kershaw's 8K version is also a disappointment in construction.  The blade is off center and has side-to-side blade play.  Tightening the pivot to center it and stop the side-to-side movement makes it nearly impossible to open.  Not standard Kershaw quality.I've owned several Kershaw models over the years.  Most have been exceptional for the price but not this one.  I wouldn't like it based on the design alone but the poor quality assembly makes it even worse.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W7AEVWY26GWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0RSZQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1W7AEVWY26GWC","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"ZT overbuilds knives.  This is no exception.  I like it but it's a monster to carry.  Very heavy and thick.  It's a heavy use working knife that should handle just about any job.  Some complain about the recurve shape of the blade being hard to sharpen but I've had no difficulty using a Spyderco Sharpmaker and leather strop mounted on a block of wood.This is not a quick flicking knife although it has a flipper.  The blade's just too thick and heavy to be zip out quickly for those who love flipping their knives around for show.

"Bought this for a recent 5-day trip.  It held up well to airline baggage handling and easily handled all the clothing and accessories both my wife and I needed for the trip.  I didn't need the suit bag that's included so I removed it when packing.  We also did not use the outer pockets since there was more than enough space inside the main compartment. The material and construction seem more than adequate for the task.  Rolls easily and the expandable handle rises to the right length for my six foot height.Since almost every bag you see at airports are black and look similar to this Travelpro, I would suggest attaching some colorful handle covers and maybe a luggage tag with a bright colorful design.  Having done this, it was relatively easy to pick out our bag when it rolled off the carousel at our destination and upon our return.  Without those markers, it would have been frustrating locating our luggage.I can't say how this will hold up to extended use.  Other reviews indicate it's at least average in the durability department.

"This is one of the original Spyderco lightweight Clipits.  It was introduced in 1990 and it and the Endura were the knives that really put Spyderco on the road to their success.  I had one of the original models with the molded-in pocket clip and one of the later models that had the screwed on metal pocket clip.  Neither of them were nearly as good as the current Delica 4.  This knife if more ergonomic and better designed, with screwed together construction, a full internal skeletonized steel frame and a longer, grippier handle for better manipulation.  I think the first knives might have been made with different steel but it was soon changed to VG10, an outstanding Japanese super steel at the time.  This knife still uses VG10 and it's still an outstanding steel that resists corrosion, takes a great edge and sharpens relatively easily.  The VG10 is a keeper.Spyderco built knives before the Delica and Endura appeared but nothing really shook up the world of knives like those knives did at the time.  The design was radical with a hole in the blade.  People screamed about how ugly they were, how they lacked a solid steel frame and scoffed that no one would buy them...that they were just a fad that would fade away quickly.  Yeah.  Right.  Spyderco is still with us and so are the Delica and Endura, upgraded through the company's Constant Quality Improvement program.  Where are those critics?  It's not easy to argue with success.Spyderco makes excellent, outstanding knives.  They cost more these days but you get your money's worth.  Except for the fact that I own some of the more deluxe Spyderco models, I would have given this knife 5 stars.  As it is, it's a classic and it easily gets 4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBK5WEQAAE4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CH3V5E#wasThisHelpful","R2HBK5WEQAAE4Y","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've only had this knife a short time but it's already competing with my beloved Gayle Bradley folder for pocket time.  And it has won most days.I'm gonna keep this short.  There's been very few criticisms of this knife.  It's consistently one of the most talked about Spyderco knives on internet forums.  It has been in constant short supply for some time now.  The prices have gone up accordingly.It is well made.  The compression lock works well.  The knife fits your hand like a Spyderco.  The S30V blade comes sharp (but mine needed a little stropping) and very ""pointy"".  The full flat grind is superb for slicing.  The G10 grips feel great and ""grippy"".  The digital camo design in the semi-translucent handle looks really good (and I usually avoid camo patterns in everything).  It's not heavy but it's well balanced.  The clip is shiny and can be placed for right/left and tip up/down carry.  Fit is typical Spyderco.I still consider the Gayle Bradley folder to be as near perfect as any current pocket knife I've ever used.  But there's no denying the Paramilitary 2 a 5-star rating.

"How did I miss this?  I've used various Spyderco knives since the original Delica/Enduras and I've owned about a dozen of them over the years.  They've been great knives although I've liked some of them better than others.  Somehow I dismissed the Dragonfly as a tiny little toy knife that wasn't worthy of consideration.  Boy, was I wrong.The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was that the Dragonfly 4 was very small and light in weight.  I opened it and immediately realized how well it fit my hand despite the size.  I have kinda large hands, by the way.  Of course Spyderco knives are all about ergonomics and the DF4 is one of the older Spyderco patterns, updated through their Constant Quality Improvement program.  Examining the knife closer I could see how such a small knife felt so much bigger and fit my large hand so well.  It's all in the choil and the choil's placement.  The choil is the half moon cut out halfway in the blade and halfway in the handle.  It's there for your index finger to rest and guide the blade.  Not only does the design and choil placement aid in manipulating and controlling the knife in use, it adds to the overall grip length.  I measured from the front of the choil to the rear of the knife and came up with about 3.75"" of usable grip length when the choil is included.  Furthermore, most of that grip length is made up of Spyderco's FRN handle with its bi-directional pattern and ergonomic shape.  Hard to describe but the thing just snugs up to the crease in your palm, sticks there and your fingers fall into the sweet spots without even thinking about it.  Ergonomics.This DF4 has a blade made of ZDP-189 steel.  This is the new super steel that has all the knife knuts going gaga.  I'm no expert on steel but I recall the main characteristic of this steel is the ability to hold a very sharp edge for a very long time while being used very much.  The downside of this is that it requires a lot of time and effort to resharpen once it gets dull.  As stated, I'm no expert on steel and I'm not a steel snob.  This is my first ZDP knife.  I only got the ZDP version of the Dragonfly because it was the cheapest knife available with that option and I wanted to give it a try.  Thus far, I have not used the knife enough to make any judgements.  It's sharp, most knives are these days.  I keep my knives sharp and try to never let them get really dull.  I doubt I will see significant benefits from ZDP but you never know until you've had enough experience.  Simply put, the standard VG10 steel used in Spyderco's Japanese-made knives is excellent and most people would be served just as well and at less cost with a VG10 bladed Dragonfly.This is a great little knife.  I've taken the wire clip off mine because I can't imagine carrying it anywhere except deep in my pocket and I'm no fan of Spyderco's wiggly wire clips.  I love Spyderco's hole in the blade opening but the DF4 is a little difficult for me to manipulate due to its size and the fact that my finger joints aren't as mobile as they once were.  I carry it in my left front pocket and just open it two handed.  If I need a knife and only have one hand available, I usually have another Spyderco clipped in a right hand pocket that's larger and easier opening for an old guy like me.Spyderco says this knife first came about in 1994.  It went under my radar for 20 years but I've spotted it now.  It may be my constant companion from now on.

"This is a small but heavily built little knife.  In comparison to the size of the overall knife, the liner and lock bar are massive.  This increases weight but it also adds to the safety of the lock.  It has good quality Chinese steel for the blade material.  Steel snobs will look down on it, knife users will just keep it sharp and use it and not think about steel formulations.  The grip panels are G10.  Nice stuff for holding onto.  You get a real full sized pocket clip instead of a cheap wire clip on this knife--that's a definite plus in my book.What are the negatives?  Not many.  The handle is kind of short for people with big hands and the weight will turn off some people (but not me).  I've noticed the Chinese Spyderco knives (Ambitious, Persistence and Tenacious...and that other one that I can't remember what it's called) tend to be a little less ergonomic than I'm used to with other Spydercos.  It's nothing to really complain about but it would have been nice to have finger choils cut into these knives for a better handling experience.  Compare the Ambitious with the Spyderco Cat G10 model (about the same size knives) and you will find the Cat just feels better and more secure due to its choil.  But the Cat also has comparatively thin liners and a thin lock bar and, overall, feels less a little less well built.The Ambitious is a good little knife at a very good price.  I certainly like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WA1MF4OE5JU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MMSDHO#wasThisHelpful","R1WA1MF4OE5JU3","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought I had reviewed the Sharpmaker before now.  I should have.  I've been using either of two models since 1990 and I've never found them to have a single fault.I don't know when Spyderco originally started building the Sharpmaker.  I've read that Sal Glesser, the owner of the company, used to travel around the country to gun and knife shows demonstrating and selling a version of this device long before the company really took off in sales.  My first model was the 203.  I bought it along with a fully serrated Spyderco Delica at a gun and knife show in 1990 and I promptly lost the Delica.  When the next show hit town a few months later, I returned and bought a fully serrated Endura.  The Sharpmaker kept that knife scary sharp for over 10 years of daily use and also worked perfectly for every other knife I owned.  The 203 model only had 40 degree inclusive angles so it was actually of limited use.  Even so, I managed to keep my knives working sharp with it.Along came the 204.  This model has both 30 and 40 degree inclusive angles.  Not only does it enable you to keep your knife sharp, it allows you to reprofile your edge as it wears down with repeated sharpenings.  This is a much better system than the old 203.  My original 203 came with an instruction book.  My 204 came with a VHS videotape.  I understand the current 204 now comes with a DVD.  Plus there are numerous videos online showing how to use the Sharpmaker.  The best ones I've seen are the series made by Sal Glesser himself, demonstrating the various uses of this device.  It's an eyeopening series of demonstrations on what this system can accomplish.While I am able to free hand sharpen okay, the Sharpmaker is so much easier to use I seldom go back to the old methods.  The Sharpmaker is also simple--much simpler than any of the current popular sharpening ""systems"" available.  I like simple.  The Sharpmaker has no moving parts or clamps to adjust or angles to set.  The only moving part is your hand and the clamping and angles are already adjusted in the device.  Nothing is simpler in design save for a single whetstone but the whetstone requires a learning curve and good hand/eye coordination.  After a little experience with the Sharpmaker, most people find it remarkably easy to work with.  And today you can buy both diamond rods and ultrafine ceramic rods to augment the standard medium and fine ceramic rods that come with the Sharpmaker.  This allows you to reprofile an edge or repair a damaged edge with the diamonds and to put a very fine polish on finished sharp edge with the ultrafine stones.  Most people can do just fine with the standard rods that come with the Sharpmaker, however.  Personally, I have those extra rods but I usually just use the medium and fine ones and finish with a strop to polish the edge.The more expensive sharpening systems will get you a sharp knife faster.  No argument there.  Using whetstones freehand can be very satisfying.  Agreed.  But the Sharpmaker is an outstanding tool when you want something combining simplicity with effectiveness and cost.  It's just about perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ80KJGCMNCAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Q9C4AE#wasThisHelpful","RQ80KJGCMNCAJ","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are no real down sides to this knife.  I've owned several molded, unlined FRN handled Spyderco knives and they have held up well to hard use.  The Stretch is fully lined with skeletonized stainless steel, so it should be even stronger.  The bi-directional texture on the FRN handle is very grippy and, as usual, Spyderco puts a functional grip shape on the knife that conforms to the hand.  The blade steel is Spyderco's standard Japanese VG10.  This is an outstanding steel and my personal favorite.  It's easy to sharpen but holds an edge very well under normal use.  It's very resistant to staining and rusting.  As usual, Spyderco provides the knife with excellent sharpness although the edge on mine shows deep machining marks.  This is simply cosmetic and it does not detract from use whatsoever.  The flat grind and relatively thin blade makes for a great slicer.  The Stretch uses a solid hourglass shaped clip that can be positioned for four methods of carrying.  Thank you, Spyderco, for not subjecting us to another knife with the cheap and flimsy wire clip.The Stretch has been around a long time.  The design apparently is a favorite of Sal Glesser, the owner of Spyderco.  The blade carries his stylized ""SAL"" signature.  It is made in Japan and there is nothing to complain about anywhere in the materials or manufacture of this knife.  I read the review about a ""warped"" blade but I don't understand the terminology.  Blades can be bent or twisted or, in cutlery terminology, ""crinked"" to fit properly but I've never heard the term ""warped"" used in regard to blade steel.  The blade in my sample of the Stretch was perfectly centered and had no contact with the liners.  Opening and closing was smooth although a bit stiff at first.  This loosened up with use and the Stretch now glides open.I'm a huge fan of the Spyderco Gayle Bradley and the Stretch shares the same drop point blade shape design and general overall look.  Both the Bradley and the Stretch feel good to hold but the Bradley is heavier in the handle which makes it better balanced in my opinion.  But the steel liners in the Stretch help it to have a good balance and the shape of its grip will probably feel better to most users who are familiar with Spyderco knives.  The Stretch is not as perfect as the Bradley but it's really good and a good solid user knife.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXZBTU49NWRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FSGYNM#wasThisHelpful","R1SXZBTU49NWRP","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an admitted knife aficionado.  I love all types of knives and I own quite a few.  Among modern folding, one hand opening knives, the Spyderco brand totals more models than all the others in my collection.  I've used Spyderco knives since the beginning of their Clipit model introduction nearly 25 years ago.  Spyderco knives always offer high quality and excellent value, even though the prices of their knives have increased a good deal over the years.  As a hedge on increased production costs, Spyderco came out with their Byrd brand of Chinese made knives several years ago and many people discovered that a knife made in China did not always have to be poorly made of poor quality materials.  As time has progressed, Spyderco has continued to have knives made for them in China and the company now uses their original company name on some of these models as well as retaining the Byrd line.The Persistence is one of four related knives in their Spyderco brand value line.  The others are the Ambitious, the Tenacious and the Resilience.  The Persistence is the medium/small model, measuring 4.125"" closed with a 2.75"" blade, G10 grip panel and a Walker liner lock.  The blade steel is 8Cr13MoV, a very good quality Chinese stainless steel that can take a very sharp edge and can be resharpened fairly easily.  The blade shape is that frequently used by Spyderco ""leaf"" design with a slight drop point.  It comes with pretty nice blade jimping for the thumb but no blade choil for the index finger.  Cutting edge is the full 2.75"" length of the blade.  The 4 inch plus length of the handle provides enough space to get a good handle on the knife for control.  The pocket clip is one of Spyderco's hourglass shaped models in bright silver and it a four position design.  The pocket clip looks really nice and contrasts with the black G10 panels.  The blade is 3mm thick which is pretty thick for such a short blade.  The liner and locking bar is also fairly thick which gives the knife a substantial feeling that I personally like.  It feels like this knife can stand up to anything for which you would use a short 2.75"" blade.I have no real complaints against this knife.  It's well made of good quality material and the fit and finish is really good.  Since it's in the same size category as the much more expensive Sage 1, I really feel like it's fair to compare these knives.  They may likely be put to the same types of uses.  The Sage has a 3"" blade that is 3mm thick and a 4.188"" handle, making it a little longer than the Persistence.  The blade steel is S30V a deluxe US-made stainless although the knife itself is made and assembled in Spyderco's Taichung, Taiwan, factory.  The blade design is the leaf shape and it has a choil integrated half into the blade and half into the handle where the index finger rests comfortably.  Jimping is present in the spine where the thumb is placed.  The cutting edge measures 2.265"".  The Sage handle is a carbon fiber overlay to a G10 layer underneath.  The carbon fiber really looks outstanding and offers an excellent wear resistance and grip surface, a surface that's not as abrasive as bare G10.  Spyderco uses their wire pocket clip for the Sage 1 which I think is a mistake because it looks cheap and flimsy and only allows tip up carry although it can be changed from right to left hand with a single screw.  The Sage 1 incorporates the same Walker liner lock design as the Persistence, however, the liner and locking bar of the Sage 1 is a bit thinner than the Persistence.  Despite the thinner metal, the Sage lock up feels secure.The things I like better about the Persistence over the Sage 1 are the thicker, sturdier liner lock, the better quality and more adaptable pocket clip and the cutting edge that is a half inch longer than that of the Sage despite the Persistence's blade being one quarter inch shorter in overall length.  The Persistence also costs $36--almost 1/3 less than the Sage.The things I like better about the Sage 1 are the carbon fiber panels for appearance and blade choil for ergonomics.  The Sage looks better and actually feels much better in the hand.  The Sage also uses more expensive deluxe steel for the blade (although it should be pointed out that S30V will require more effort to sharpen if you let the knife get dull or you damage the edge).  Those improvements make the knife worth the extra cost in my opinion, however, the Sage 1 currently sells on Amazon for $102--2.8 times the cost of the Persistence.When considering a knife that will be put to a lot of use, a knife that likely will get beaten up and come out with scars, a knife that needs frequent sharpening, the Persistence compares very favorably with the Sage 1.  It's built heavier with a blade that is easier to sharpen.  It doesn't cost a lot and can be replaced painlessly should the user lose it or manage to break it.  It doesn't have the excellent ergonomics of the Sage 1 but the Persistence is entirely useable without any really significant limitations.  It's hard to overlook the value of the Persistence.  It's a good high quality working knife that one might buy and consider disposable if necessary.  It lacks the refinements of the Sage but it gives up nothing in practical use.  I personally consider the Sage 1 as just short of perfection in a modern folder of its size, however, I really like the Persistence and I have to say I like it just about as much based on a completely different set of criteria.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZ88A763ZS5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002IWWYS4#wasThisHelpful","RYZ88A763ZS5M","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm leaning more and more toward smaller (but not too much smaller) knives so the Sage series got my attention.  The resemblance of the carbon fiber laminate handle to the Spyderco Gayle Bradley was the first thing I noticed.  After buying the knife, I have to say it is a damn nice knife in the 3"" blade category.  Overall, the Sage I is pretty close to perfect but not quite as perfect as the Gayle Bradley model, in my opinion.What you get in the Sage I is a knife with a 3 inch blade and a well designed 4 inch plus handle that makes it easy to use.  The blade is Spyderco's leaf shape in S30V steel.  S30V is one of the ""super steels"" that is now ubiquitous in upper quality modern folding knives.  The steel is no longer the shining star of super steels but it's still got a good glow going for edge retention with just a little extra effort needed in resharpening.  In my opinion, there are lots of good steels in use today and all of them are excellent with not enough difference in performance to really make much difference for the average knife buyer.  As is usual with Spyderco knives, the Sage I came nice and sharp.  I ran it over a stop with some green polishing compound and this resulted in an even sharper edge.  Can't complain.  For anyone who buys a really nice knife, you should know the trick to retaining a razor sharp edge is to never let the knife get dull to begin with.  After using it, touch up the edge on a hard Arkansas or ceramic stone and then strop it.  You will be rewarded with a contantly sharp knife.  If you let the edge dull or you damage the edge, you can expect to spend a good bit of time with S30V steel to return the edge to razor sharpness.The handle has a good ergonomic shape and the panels are made of a carbon fiber layer laminated over a layer of G10.  This makes for a great feeling grip that looks incredible.  It's the same material used in the Gayle Bradley and I believe I said in my review of that knife that the carbon fiber looks ""just lovely"".  Ditto here.  Fit and finish is about as good as it gets.  Spyderco's Taichung Taiwan facility is well known for their superior craftsmanship and they certainly deserve praise for this model.The Sage I uses a liner lock.  Liner locks and frame locks are sort of ""in"" right now and that's okay--they work well if they are well designed and well matched to the blade.  Here is the first point that knocks the Sage I out of the perfect category.  The liner on the knife is fairly thin and, correspondingly, the locking bar is also pretty thin.  On a smaller knife, it's not necessary to have a massive liner with massive lock bar like that on the Gayle Bradley (damn... I can't stop bringing up that knife!) but I really wish Spyderco had increased the thickness of the steel liner in the Sage by about 50%.  This would make the locking bar a little heftier and rigid and I, for one, wouldn't mind the extra weight.  It's not as thin and flexible as the Cat G10 liner lock bar but the Sage liner could stand improvement.  I can detect just the tiniest amount of movement in the Sage's lock after lock up.  But the blade on the Sage has zero movement on lock up, unlike my copy of the Cat G10.  I'm probably nit picking about the liner and lock bar since it actually seems pretty solid.  Unlike the Gayle Bradley (there I go again!), it's easy to access the lock bar release with the thumb of the dominant hand.  This should appease the inveterate blade flippers out there.My only other nit to pick on the Sage I is the wire clip.  I've criticized Spyderco's use of wire clips before and I continue to dislike them.  They look cheap, especially when used on knife that costs over a hundred bucks, and they don't feel as secure as Spyderco's other flat metal clips.  The clip on my Sage I moves around side-to-side when applying light finger pressure.  That's just wrong for a knife this expensive.In summation, I rate the Sage I as a 4.5 star knife.  I admit I'm getting more and more critical of items I review and most people who buy the Sage will totally love it.  Not perfect but worth every penny you pay for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B9Y03L66VFTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013AW8Y2#wasThisHelpful","R2B9Y03L66VFTM","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a first impression based on limited operation of the Epson WF 3620.  I have experience with Epson based on my ownership for about two years of the wonderful Stylus Photo R3000.  If the WF 3620 continues functioning as reliably and with output quality comparable to the R3000 (as a standard printer as opposed to a photo printer), I will be a most happy camper.The WF 3620 is a standard size printer/scanner/fax/copier for small office or home use.  The quality of Epson prints are excellent and the printer appears to be very robust in construction.  Setup was simple and pretty frustration free.  I must admit I'm not very much attuned to technology so it's nice when a process is kept simple.  I'm using the printer with a standard USB connection although it can be run with Wi-Fi.  No problems are encountered with operation this way and, since the printer is located adjacent to the computer, there's no overriding reason to go wireless.  I have not yet set up the fax.  I don't really have much use for the fax feature so it's not a priority.  The other functions are working fine.Since I've only had limited experience with this printer, I can't say how it will perform in the long term.  I expect it to work fine, given my past experience with Epson.  Unless something unforeseen happens, I can recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M8T4L403FEIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGF06#wasThisHelpful","R1M8T4L403FEIR","A1FHUYGO3OWWRF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FHUYGO3OWWRF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this in exchange for an honest review.I had been using another wireless mouse, but it was not working very consistently, so I decided to give this one a try. First of all, let me say that if you use a laptop and you use a mouse with a wire, or you use the trackpad, wireless is the way to go. It is much faster than the trackpad, and it is much less bother than the wire.So this one seems to work more smoothly than my previous one, and I am very happy with it. The ergonomics are great. My only complaint is that it came in a box with no instructions or explanation, and a new user might not know to look for a little usb thingy that you plug into your computer to send the signal for this. I did know, but I looked all over the place, in the box, in the shipping bag, and in the trash, looking for that small little device. Then I opened up the battery compartment to put the batteries in, and there it was! Maybe everybody but me knows that little parts are hidden in the battery compartment, but I didn't know that, and it caused me confusion.But once I got that straightened out, I am very happy with this product.

"I have a weird interest in reading about diseases, and this book is one of the very best in the genre. Quammen writes for National Geographic, and he goes *everywhere.* If there was a disease outbreak in the Central African Republic in 1987, chances are, he has interviewed the doctor who first spotted the disease, the locals whose family members died, and the BSL-4 researchers in Virginia who analyzed it, and he probably also climbed down into a cave where the bat that spreads the disease roosts. This book is better than The Hot Zone. It dispels some of the over-blown language used in that book (people do not dissolve inside from Ebola.) and it is arguably just better writing.Quammen keeps the balance between travel and adventure writing on the one hand, personal interviews (of the ""His desk is piled high with papers, and he's wearing blue corduroy slacks and a black turtleneck and wire-rim glasses"" type), and real science writing. You learn a lot about diseases from the microscopic level to the human story of what it's like to have the disease, to the incredible courage and dedication of the people who fight the diseases, whether in the clinic or in the lab.Realistically, most of us are at essentially zero risk of dying of Ebola, but Quammen balances that with insight into things that might really harm us--SARS, AIDS, and the good old flu, which could still come roaring back as a killer.I was sorry when it ended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ1E8NN9VUY11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00856PC4K#wasThisHelpful","RJ1E8NN9VUY11","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

His descriptions of the blandness and soothingness of hotels and the sameness of conventions and conferences is spot-on.

"I received one of these for free in exchange for an honest review. Unfortunately, I cannot give it a very positive review. I have a battery-powered skin-cleansing tool already, and I thought this one might be something new, different and better. It is different--the brush is super plush and super soft--it feels like velvet, and the individual bristles are extremely fine. And the vibration is extremely fast and gentle.The net result is that it feels like nothing on your skin! It is so gentle that it doesn't feel to me like it will have any effect. A brush against your skin cannot pull anything out of your pores, so the only way I can see for a product like this to work is if it removes a layer of dead skin cells and thus opens up your pores. But this seems far too gentle to have any effect--like scrubbing your face with velvet! If you have very smooth clear sensitive skin, and other scrubbers are too rough for you, you could try this one.The price is very low. The packaging has no explanation of anything on it.

"Wallace does an excellent of making this journey come alive, and he raises the very questions that haunted me while and after reading the book: what, exactly, is the point of traveling deep into the jungle set aside for uncontacted tribes of Amazonian Indians? The journey was grueling, and extremely dangerous, and any contact with the tribal people would have possibly deadly consequences for the uncontacted people as well--so why walk right into areas they are known to live? One man on the expedition actually walked through a village of Indians. The risk to both sides (searchers and those hiding from them) seems out of proportion to what is learned--yup, they're still there! And yes, their lands are threatened by others who search for oil, lumber, and other commodities. But bringing men from other tribes, semi-Brazilianized Indians who themselves are only a generation or so from uncontacted status seemed to me like asking for trouble. Still, a great read! It is fascinating to realize that there are people alive on the planet today who have not yet learned to use bows and arrows, and club their enemies (and prey) to death. The bow and arrow is pretty basic technology--how can they not have gotten the hang of it? And why do they succumb so dreadfully to common germs? Are we all walking germ-dispensers? It's a puzzle to me. They live in an environment we would find absolutely forbidding, and yet they are so vulnerable.

"The first thing that needs to be said is that the writing here is first-rate. Ellen Feldman can evoke character and place and a time period as well as anyone. And the time period she evokes is the time just before I was born, and thus the backdrop to my childhood, things I heard and half-understood. (The story begins in 1948; My parents married in 1949 and I was born in 1952, But her milieu--upper-class, literate, Jewish Manhattan--is a long way from mine --Irish-Catholic working class small city.) The narrative begins on November 22, 1963, which of course is the day Kennedy was killed, and then goes back to fill in the context. This date feels highly significant to the story, but unlike Chekhov's gun, as far as I could tell, it was never actually used.While the Cold War and the Red Scare and the CIA is background, the story is not really about them. It is about a marriage, and a woman's perception of it. IN the end, I felt that was both the story's strength and weakness. I expected it to be, and it is set up to be, a political story, but in the end, it really isn't.And while her writing is Feldman's greatest strength, I also felt that she took a short-cut in having a different narrator untangle much of the unwittingness that is the basis of the story. A found diary is a clunky way to present a different point of view, and it broke my willing suspension of disbelief.I did enjoy reading, and I think it's an excellent evocation of the time and place, and of a marriage.

"The narrative style in this novel is great. Cassella pulls you in and maintains a clear and engaging story-line. The writing is confident and professional. My only qualm about the book is that it rambles too much. Two interlocking stories that take a long while to intersect, and once they do, the dual narratives become a little hard to follow. Some of the subplots don't seem to be organic to the story. And the twin aspect of it, which I expected to be a major part don't come into play until the very end, and even then, it's not actually a twin. But I enjoyed reading the story and it kept my interest to the very end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CYFO15YVATT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451627939#wasThisHelpful","R3CYFO15YVATT9","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this as a free sample in exchange for a review. I am eliminating carbs from my diet, and I miss having spaghetti to top with yummy meatballs. I previously bought a vegetable-peeler type juliener, and have used it quite a few times to turn zucchini into ""zoodles."" So I was eager to try this.The packaging is excellent. Also, the design is sleek, but the metal pieces on the sides, which look like they might be some sort of cutting blades are actually handles. That seems like a misstep, because they are actually a little sharp. I used it for the first time today, and it's very easy to use. You insert the zucchini in the top and turn it like a pencil sharpener. A hint: press the zucchini to one side, not centered as you would do with an actual pencil sharpener, to maintain the most smooth contact with the cutting edge. There is less waste than with the previous type I used, and what's left comes out as a neat little ""cob."" It takes less pressure and is all-around neater and more efficient.However--the end product was long continuous slivers of zucchini, and after I cooked it up, I found it a little hard to eat. INstead of  6-8"" segments of ""zoodle"" there is yards of it! So you have to bite through the noodles. A minor point, but worth a mention. Next time I might cut the noodles into a more manageable length.Would this work with other vegetables, other than zucchini and summer squash? I don't know. Carrots are a lot harder than zucchini and I haven't tried them.Along with this, I received a free gift of a round device that slices vegetables into decorative designs. It looked like an asthma inhaler, and there were no instructions, so I had to email the company to figure out how to use it. There's a button in the center that you rotate sideways and then use it as a lever to turn the blades. Until I figured it out, I felt that the design was very dangerous, because there are sharp teeth that I thought I had to use to move it from one position to the other. Anyhow, they need to include instructions!If you want to cut carbs, this is a worthwhile tool. (I would not call it a HULK, nor a pasta maker.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EAOLNHI2LWVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LK1C9QG#wasThisHelpful","R2EAOLNHI2LWVF","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received one of these for free in exchange for an honest review. Unfortunately, I cannot give it a very positive review. I have a battery-powered skin-cleansing tool already, and I thought this one might be something new, different and better. It is different--the brush is super plush and super soft--it feels like velvet, and the individual bristles are extremely fine. And the vibration is extremely fast and gentle.The net result is that it feels like nothing on your skin! It is so gentle that it doesn't feel to me like it will have any effect. A brush against your skin cannot pull anything out of your pores, so the only way I can see for a product like this to work is if it removes a layer of dead skin cells and thus opens up your pores. But this seems far too gentle to have any effect--like scrubbing your face with velvet! If you have very smooth clear sensitive skin, and other scrubbers are too rough for you, you could try this one.The price is very low. The packaging has no explanation of anything on it. You have to figure out how to open it, and you have to provide your own AAA battery. The look is very sleek and sturdy.

"I received a sample of this oil in exchange for an honest review. This is the most intense lavender scent of any lavender essential oil I have ever used. It seems to be highly volatile, which means that molecules of lavender essence are readily emitted and enter into your body.

"Some folks just don't want to believe this, that fat could possibly be better for you than whole grains. But I think Nina Teicholz has done a remarkable job of showing just how weak the evidence for low-fat eating ever was. The old common-sense view was that ""starchy food"" made poor people obese. That was overthrown, and instead red meat and full-fat became the bad guy that everyone just ""knows"" is bad for you.But at the same time that Americans, on an overall, statistical basis, have been eating fewer eggs, less whole dairy, less red meat, more grains, and more fresh vegetables, we have also been becoming more obese. This is a fact that no amount of nit-picking can deny. We have all seen it with our own eyes, if we have lived long enough (I am 62.) The counter-argument is that the low-fat diet hasn't been rigorous enough. We just all need to eat more kale.But the fact is that humans need 1500-2000 calories per day, and you cannot get that from leafy greens. You have to get adequate calories either from a lot of carbs, or from meat, dairy, and eggs.This idea is never mentioned in her book, but it led me to wonder if the autism epidemic could be related to the low-fat diets of women before they get pregnant. while they are pregnant, during lactation (she does mention that breast milk is changed in women who eat little fat), in baby formulas, and in young weaned children. Brains need fat, and is it possible that those who obey the culture's demonization of fat the most, conscientious middle to upper-middle-class women, are actually harming their children. It is a fact that autism is more prevalent in upper socioeconomic levels of society. The only correlation that doesn't fit is the gender variation, but I don't know of any possible cause for autism that would explain why it's more boys than girls. Maybe their brains just needed more fat.There is no need to posit a ""conspiracy""--Nina explains how well-meaning people with no axes to grind could come to believe weak to bad science. It is now accepted that hydrogenation of oils into fats turned out to be a mistake, again with no intentional bad guys.  Crisco and margarine were touted as health foods, purer than animal fat, but pretty much everyone from the FDA on down now concedes that they are certainly worse than oil. Total cholesterol was also once seen as conventional wisdom's bad guy, which later was revised to ""good"" cholesterol and ""bad"" cholesterol. Mistakes, serious long-term ones, can and do happen in science, and if opposing views are suppressed, they can remain unchallenged as consensus for a long time.I'm putting my money and my mouth on plenty of leafy greens topped with plenty of fatty meat and butter, and I went out and bought some lard (""manteca"") at the Hispanic market near me, to experiment with cooking without corn oil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AAVWSVFLMEW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A25FDUA#wasThisHelpful","R1AAVWSVFLMEW2","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may be more  background info on the philosophical origins of deism and what it really meant to people at the time than you want, but if you're tired of Christians trotting out quotes from Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, or George Washington that make them sound like evangelicals, you should make the effort to get through this.The writing is clear and fairly snappy, but the author traces every line of the intro to the Declaration of Independence back to the ancient Greek philosophers--Why ""we hold these truths to be self-evident""? Who is this ""Creator"" who endowed us with rights? What does ""the pursuit of happiness"" mean?It turns out that ""Nature and Nature's God"" might just mean ""nature,"" and deism is more or less the equivalent of atheism, in his parsing.

"I am not a believer in Tibetan Buddhism, though I am interested and positively inclined towards the Tibetan people. I read this book because it popped up after I read another book about the concept of the terton, a ""treasure finder"" who magically discovers scrolls, statues and revelations. The previous book was so credulous that I couldn't take it seriously, but I found this book much more interesting because the writer maintains a somewhat skeptical stance towards the things he is told.Thomas Shor interviewed dozens of people who had first-hand experience following a guru who claimed that he could gain them entrance into a beyul, a concept of an earthly paradise on which Shangri-la  in Lost Horizon s a somewhat bastardized version. The concept is not unlike western religious believers who sell everything they own and wait on a mountain-top for the Second Coming--and so far have always come away disappointed, though usually still believing. These Tibetan folks also got ""close"" to their promised land after walking away from all their earthly possessions, but their take-away seemed even more positive than that of let-down followers of Christian prophets. They seemed forever changed by even approaching the entrance (high on a glacial mountain) to a land of perfect comfort and earthly attainment.Not everyone will enjoy the story, but I did and so I recommend it if you have a somewhat skeptical but open mind towards Tibetan supernatural events.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHJGAOUIGUT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006TR0Y7W#wasThisHelpful","R1GHJGAOUIGUT2","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this tedious and in the end I just skimmed to get to the conclusion. I enjoy knitting, and mysteries, and cooking, so I expected to like it, but the narrative was poorly done and the set-up works badly, in my opinion. The set-up is that Casey is in charge of running a Sheep to Shawl retreat, but she doesn't really know anything about sheep, or shearing them, or spinning, or even knitting beyond garter stitch. This is handy for the author, since it gives her a reason not to actually *describe* any of these activities. To me, this ruins the whole concept of a ""knitting mystery."" As a knitter (and potential spinner) I choose a novel like this in order to enjoy the imaginative experience of the shearing, the prepping, the spinning, and the knitting. All of that is missing--the retreat center declares sheep-shearing off-limits, so they just pick up some already shorn fleeces, and then everything else along the way is sort of skimmed over as well.In addition, the main narrative drive is that Casey is running here and there, making and delivering cupcakes, baking desserts for various establishments, and having unpleasant conversations with several different people--all of which was just tiresome to read. Casey was stressed throughout the weekend, since she didn't know what she was doing, and ready about someone's stress-filled life is just not enjoyable to me!Also, the book seemed not to know what genre is was supposed to be--is this a mystery or a romance novel? As much time was spent on Casey's complicated attractions to a couple of different guys (or lack of attraction, in some cases.) At times it felt more like a set-up for a romance novel than a mystery.And then there were some details that were just unpleasant--an ongoing ""joke"" about the fact that Casey's cat like canned tuna cat food, which is referred to over and OVER again as ""stink fish."" I'm sorry, but those are just unpleasant words. There was also a plot detail about moldy, mildewed clothing. Again, when I read about stink fish and mildew smells, and then about eating cupcakes on the same page, it is unpleasant. Not cozy!In the end, the pay-off was just not worth it. And the pattern for a shawl with no picture or sketch of what it will look like is not enticing either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15TJXX7LGYTIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDMMF56#wasThisHelpful","R15TJXX7LGYTIX","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free sample of this product to try and review. I am very pleased with it. It is a clay-based skin mask, so the color is naturally a bit odd--a sort of greyish green color. I like that no unnatural coloring is used to ""mask"" the color of the clay. There is a touch of eucalyptus in the formula, which gives a very mild tingle. The product is very nearly odorless, again a sign of its all-natural ingredients. I smoothed it on with my fingers and it has a nice texture and goes on easily. As it dried, it seemed to sink right into my skin and disappear, unlike other clay-based masks that end up looking like an old clay pot! After washing my face with warm water, the product came off readily, with no need to scrub it away.And the result? My skin feels soft, smooth, and yes, refreshed! The jar is generously sized, and I think the price is quite fair. I am 62 and have skin that is dry in spots but still oily and prone to whiteheads around my nose, and this product is very useful for me.

"It's hard to know how to rate this book. It is probably really excellent for what it is, but what it is is not suitable reading for most people. This is the life story of a Tantric mystic who lived in Tibet in the 19th and early 20th century (died 1926). His claim to fame is that he was a revealer of hidden (physical) treasures, such as statues and scrolls that had been hidden by the founder of Tibetan Buddhism a thousand years before. The problem with reading the book, as a general reader who is interested in and sympathetic towards Tibet, but not a believer, is that the book takes all his wonders at face value. And I just can't. It seems to me that he must have been some sort of a magician, in the sense of fooling the eye. He opens holes on granite walls and pulls out statues. I cannot just take that as a fact. Also, there are many many names and rituals included in the book, and unless one is deeply familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, you cannot take it all in.What is valuable about this book is that it gives a view of Tibetan Buddhism from the inside, as it is experienced by Tibetan people. The world is filled with demons and spirits, many of them malicious, and one has to overpower them and bring them into subjection to Buddhism. It's easy to see the Dalai Lama's benign countenance and forget that this is the underside of Tibetan thinking.I find it puzzling, however, that people who are not from that background of belief, people for whom the world is not seething with demonic spirits and guardians of sacred landscapes would imbibe that view and pass it along as fact. My understanding of the end goal of Buddhism, including the Tibetan variety, is to come to understand that all these demonic forces are in fact just illusions created by one's own mind, and that conquering demons is done by recognizing their non-existence. For people steeped in an animist world-view, living in an extreme environment and always under threat from outsiders, it makes sense to incorporate their view into Buddhism. But for people from a materialist, rationalist, critical-thinking background, it makes no sense to me to first submerge in the animist worldview, and then attempt to overcome it. And that's what this book (and this author) seems to do. There is no common-sense or rationalist explanation for any of what Terton Sogyal is supposed to have done. The story is told entirely from within a Tibetan point of view.The author spent 15 years writing this book, visiting all the sacred places and learning from a person who is believed to be a reincarnation of Sogyal. I simply couldn't enter into the point of view that he espoused, and unless you are already deeply immersed in Tibetan studies, I doubt if you will be able to either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BF8NH0KSWHV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140194146X#wasThisHelpful","R2BF8NH0KSWHV0","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Longer than a magazine article, but shorter than a book, this is a great example of how and why digital publishing makes sense, despite the author's complaints in the Op-Ed pages of the NY Times. I ordered it after reading his essay, and I enjoyed reading it. I don't accept his premise that he was somehow cheated when his e-publisher went under--at least with amazon, he could publish it himself and find an audience. Which he has!The story is fascinating at times, with descriptions of the hellish landscape that an oil boomtown creates. It is also a little boring at times, as it is as much a travelogue as an expose. He does do a good job of presenting the unvarnished opinions of people on both sides of the controversy--yes, the pipeline creates jobs, and yes, we need the oil to keep our economy going, but also, yes, it makes a hideous mess, even if it works exactly as intended with no leaks, and yes, it may be hastening climate change, which might make our other problems all pale by comparison.I'm sure that if we had lived in Birmingham England or rural New England in the 17th century, we would also have been appalled at the lovely landscape being marred by industry--the industry that makes modern life possible.Or is this a whole different order of damage, not only aesthetic but ultimately destructive on a scale that is hard to imagine? Most of the people who stand to benefit, short-term, can't bear to even ask that question. If we don't take the oil out of the ground, someone else will, they reason.

"I keep up fairly well with research in the field of psychology and learning in particular, so much of this information was not entirely new and surprising to me, but Benedict Carey does a great job of pulling a lot of different research together and presenting it a practical way. This is more a guide to what is known than a self-help book, but it will definitely be of use both to teachers and students who want to understand how to study more effectively.A couple of take-aways--half-forgetting and then re-learning, especially by trying to remember, make the thing you are trying to learn really stick. So as a teacher, when I start class on Monday and ask students to recall what it was we were working on last Friday, that is not just review--that is learning. It would be best, I suppose, if instead of asking the whole class and letting one or two students do the hard work, I had everyone try their best to write down what the remember about passive voice or the subjunctive.That brings up another great point that he makes--that testing, quizzing, and self-testing are highly effective ways not of evaluating but of actually learning. This helps to overcome what he calls the Fluency Illusion, and what I have long called the ""smile-and-nod"" level of understanding. IN other words, when the teacher is doing math problems on the board and you are watching, you understand--you smile and nod and think, ok, yeah, sure, I get it. It is only when the tables are turned and the teacher says, Ok, now you try it, that the gaps in understanding are revealed.So if you are studying for a test on state capitals, let's say, and you see Georgia: Atlanta, you think right, sure. But it's not until someone says Georgia and you can say Atlanta that you actually know it. And each time you test yourself, or have someone else test you, you are retrieving and then re-storing that memory, making it more salient. I would go so far as to suggest that one difference between middle-class kids and poor kids in school is that middle-class parents often quiz their kids on their school-work. ""Let's go over those state capitals together,"" and less-educated parents probably don't. That could be enough to make a big difference, since this is such a powerful learning tool.He also reports on interesting work on how location and distraction can help rather than hurt our learning--studying in a variety of places, with varying amounts of distraction can help us remember more. And spaced practice works better than intense practice. IN other words, if you have one hour to learn the capitals of all the countries in Europe, or the parts of the hand, it would be better to do 3 20-minute sessions, especially if you sleep between at least two of the sessions, than to do all 60 minutes at once. And what about cramming? We don't really need research to tell us this, but yes, it works if your only goal is to pass the test, but if you actually want to learn the material, it is worthless. You forget it as fast as you ""learned"" it.One great point to this book is that he covers widely diverse fields of study--from physical skills like a golf swing or a tennis serve, to complex skills like flying a plane, to rote memorization, such as vocabulary or state capitals., to comprehension of difficult concepts like economics or physics. Many of the techniques he describes apply across the board, and others are more particular to certain types of learning. For example, for physical performance (a piano recital or a baseball tryout, you do better if you sleep in a bit, getting plenty of the kind of sleep that occurs towards morning. For memory like a vocabulary test, it's better to get plenty of the early-stage sleep, so go to bed on time and get up early in the morning to review. Your brain does a lot of memory consolidation while you sleep, and specific types in specific stages.One point that he doesn't directly address but that I am familiar with the research on is whether it's better to memorize large things as a whole or in chunks. For example, if you are an actor, or you want to memorize a long poem or speech, should you work on the first sentence, and then the second sentence, and so on, or should you go through the whole thing each time. The answer is that you should do it whole--it will feel like you're not getting anywhere at first, but suddenly, the whole thing will be in there This fits with what he says about inter-leaving---practicing a variety of different things in each session rather than chunking it all together--master skill A before moving on to skill B. No, it's better to do some A, some B, and some C, even though it will feel like you aren't making progress at first.I recommend this book to every teacher of any subject, and to anyone who is a student at any level, and to parents, who worry that their kids are too distracted and unfocused in the way they study--turns out that distraction and lack of focus can serve you well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBCKAZKBIJS4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993888#wasThisHelpful","RBCKAZKBIJS4N","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel that this novel had the potential to be a great story, but the narrative is not well-handled. The story begins on V-J Day, but then jumps back a year, then two years, so that we are following the point-of-view of a 7-year-old girl (Wally). It's not easy to make such a young child believable, and I didn't find this attempt particularly successful. Then the story shifts focus again, and now we're following the thoughts and actions of the girl's mother (Stella), including some fairly explicit sex scenes. Then finally, half-way through the story, we get back to V-J Day, and a shocking, but to me not credible, turn of events. Her mother may have been ""unstable,"" but her action was so sudden, so unprepared for, that it was not just shocking, it was out of character and simply not believable.We also focus in on Wally's childhood friend, Ham, the son of the family maid, and on the maid herself (Loretta) and there are odd parallels between the secrets of their lives and the secrets of Wally's life. But these secondary characters, Loretta in particular, were very one-dimensional to me.The imagery of the secret life of ants was supposed to work in much the same way as the bees in The Secret Life of Bees, but this book pales by comparison to that book in every way. I have read The Secret Lief of Bees and taught it in class for 7 years now, and it continues to reward re-reading. This book has none of the charm, or depth of characters, or effective narrative style. It might also be compared to To Kill a Mockingbird, but only in the sense that we have racial issues, and a very young child as the main point-of-view character.Most unsuccessful of all is the way the book moves forward in time at the end, bringing us to Wally as a young woman of 20, and like her mother, entangled with two different men. The ending aims to be lyrical, but it simply didn't work for me. Too much territory is covered in 292 pages--if you want to write a multi-generational saga, it's going to need 500 pages to do it. If you want to tell Wally's story, the book needs to be much more tightly focused.The time, the place, the set-up are all promising, and I was interested to know how the story was going to turn out, but all in all, it was unsatisfying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VTFHGNZB5QO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400064686#wasThisHelpful","R3VTFHGNZB5QO6","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an absorbing story, and the writing is just outstanding., It kept me up at night reading, and I was sorry to see it end. The voyage itself doesn't actually get started till over 100 pages in, but the background information was fascinating in itself.Perhaps the thing about this story that surprised me and will stick with me the most is how recently it was that human beings finished exploring this planet: in 1879, educated scientists actually believed that the North Pole was in an open polar sea of temperate climate. One theory as to why the arctic was ice-free (surrounded by merely a ""girdle of ice"" which could be smashed through) was that there was a hole or vent from which interior heat kept the water warm. Or maybe the Kuro Siwo (Black Current or Kuro-Shio) from Japan, the Pacific equivalent of the Gulf Stream, reached all the way to the pole. Ninety years later, man walked on the moon--the rate of increase of our knowledge has certainly been exponential!In addition to the sheer adventure and adversity of a ship aiming for the pole and becoming ice-bound, there is a love story underlying the main plot which will tug at your heart. And the captain, DeLong, seems to have been a man of most superb character who maintained discipline and the spirits and safety of his men against incredible odds.This story would be suitable for young people, as it is inspiring, challenging, and not offensive or depressing throughout most of the story. A classic story of human courage and the human spirit. (I don't want to spoil the story, but I will say that dogs have to be shot, which would be disturbing to some, though the scenes are not gruesome.)I will definitely be reading Hampton Sides other books--this is meticulously researched and elegantly written.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAMD5KMA4M5FW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385535376#wasThisHelpful","RAMD5KMA4M5FW","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thomas Beller, the author of this book, is clearly a gifted writer in his own right. This book manages to tell quite a lot about JD Salinger while seldom addressing the topic head-on. Instead, Beller wanders here and there, describing his quest to capture the essence of who Salinger was, but also revealing quite a bit about himself, about the people who knew Salinger, but at the same time respecting the essential privacy of Salinger.He also muses on the contradiction that is implicit in a desire for privacy--by escaping, Salinger created that much more curiosity about just what it was that he wanted so much to hide. Beller quotes a sentence from Time magazine, in which neighbors of Salinger ""could stand it no longer"" and climbed the fence to get into Salinger's property. He wonders at the word ""it."" What was ""it"" that they could stand no longer?And then, Beller does a bit of sleight-of-hand, insinuating that Salinger's relationship with children and young adults was not quite healthy, that he may have had the mind, at least, of a child molester. He does this mostly by having other people either hint at, or deny, that this was the case. And this makes me wonder about the focus of Salinger's work. I recently read an early work by John Updike, also a favorite in The New Yorker, a decade or so later than Salinger, and it makes me think about how adult Updike was, even as a quite young man, and how adolescent Salinger's attention was.It's an odd book, writing about writing about Salinger. But I found it quite enjoyable, and I may have to pick up Nine Stories again and re-read them, as an adult myself this time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T6FKU9JYY5JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544261992#wasThisHelpful","R1T6FKU9JYY5JT","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some of the recipes in this book are for simple salads that pretty much anyone already knows how to make, or can find online--tuna salad, a Greek salad, bacon-lettuce-tomato salad. Others, quite a few, are salads only in the sense that they are served cold--perhaps the most outrageous ""salad"" I have ever seen is one made with six (!) Snickers candy bars chopped up and mixed with apples, a container of Cool Whip and a box of instant butterscotch pudding and then garnished with caramel syrup. If that sounds like a ""salad"" you would enjoy, then this is the book for you.The photos of the salads are very attractive, if small but the lay-out leaves much to be desired in the kindle edition as the font for recipe names is large and runs to several lines and most of the recipes run onto adjacent pages, so unlike in a well-designed hardcover cookbook, the recipe is not on a single page. There are 40 recipes in total, and while there are a few that I might like to make, most are either obvious ones that I already know how to make or goopy concoctions of canned fruit, cool whip and pudding mixes.  Honestly, the cover is the best thing about this book!I received the kindle book for free in exchange for an honest review, and I feel bad to have to write such a negative review, but I have to have some integrity is what I say. These days, with so many free recipes available online, a cookbook has to be pretty special for me to want to buy it, and this does not measure up, in my opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RTJURIDH9VGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJLJP4C#wasThisHelpful","R3RTJURIDH9VGB","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I generally buy the bags with actual zippers, and this bag does not have that. You press together two colored lines and they change to a third color and you know it is firmly closed. In a way, this is easier and less likely to give out after multiple uses. On the other hand, it is maybe a bit less easy to use. The thickness of the plastic is good.

"An oral history gathers up what people choose to say about their own lives and experience, but I would expect some analysis or commentary on the part of the historian. This book held my interest, but in the end, I was disappointed at how shallow or unreflective these cloistered women seemed to be. I don't know whether that is a result of their years of silence, that they simply can't find the vocabulary to discuss their inner struggles, or whether the author didn't ever press them to dig a little deeper.These women comment on the fact that they will not have children, but they never comment on the fact that they have also foresworn sex, which surely, for women who grew up in the secular world in the 70s,, 80s or 90s is a thought that must have crossed their minds. One of the stories, about a woman who was in an active order, hints at a personal love between herself and another nun, but no reflection on that possibility is included either.They all comment on the fact that things were ""hard"" or ""counter-cultural,"" but without any personal analysis of why they persevered through such difficulties. In the end, it was an oddly surface exploration of a deeply interior life. They come across as inarticulate, and I don't know whether that's due to some sort of mental damage (they live, after all, under circumstances that otherwise would constitute a form a torture), or inability to express their true thoughts, or the inability of their interviewer to help them express themselves.And yet--I couldn't stop reading.

"I read all of Dorothy Sayers canon about 30 years ago, and I loved the depth, the characters, the wit, and the historical and geographic background. In this book, the characters come alive, now parents of high school children, and still very much in love, and dealing with the disappointment that any parent might feel at a child going in a direction different from one's own. So I enjoyed that aspect of the book. And I also enjoyed the Oxford setting, the feeling that I am seeing what goes on behind the scenes in that exalted and storied place.The murders take place as a result of an academic squabble over an ancient manuscript which may or may not have been annotated by King Alfred the Great, and which may or may not be worth a lot of money and save the college's finances, and may or may not be a forgery.  So again, like in Sayers' original books, you console yourself that this is not just a mindless cozy murder mystery, but you are learning things. However, the plot was fairly hard to follow, especially since there was no meaningful character development of the Oxford dons who might be involved in this mess.I did not have a clear recollection of the plot lines of Harriet Vane's books, so the link-up there didn't give me any thrill of recognition.Nevertheless, I found myself unwilling to leave the largish paperback at home when I took a plane trip recently, and all in all it was a comforting read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HWFD3FEF38NW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250032792#wasThisHelpful","R2HWFD3FEF38NW","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I may not be the best person to review this, since I have no experience with french presses to compare this to. I received this free in exchange for an honest review. On the positive side, it is an extremely handsome-looking pot--it is shiny and seems very sturdy and well made. It came well-packaged, as well.On the downside, the instructions for how to make coffee in it were rather sketchy on the side of the box, and since this was my first time, I felt that I had to go online to look up more detailed instructions.The rest of my comments are based on French press vs. an automatic coffee-maker that I usually use. I purchased fresh coffee that I ground at the store in order to try this out since I usually use a very fine grind. According to what I read, the temperature of the water is crucial, so I used an instant read thermometer to check (and re-check) the heat of the water. That means that I had to measure out water, put it in the microwave, set it for 5  minutes, check the temp, do it for a couple more minutes, check again, and so on. Then I poured it over the grounds. I was unsure how long I should wait before pressing, and again, my online source said that this is important. Finally, I pressed, and it worked smoothly and easily. Then I had to pour off the rest of the coffee into some other pot so that it wouldn't over-brew.Finally, I tasted it--and meh. It reminded me of percolated coffee from my youth. Maybe I'm wrong, but I am accustomed to the taste of drip coffee, and I like it. This was not notably better, and it was far more effort--effort that I am in no way prepared to make every morning before my first cup. I like the ease of a Mr. Coffee maker, and the taste of this is not enough to outweigh the inconvenience.And then I had to clean this thing, which meant using a spoon to dig out a hockey puck of loose coffee grounds, again much less convenient than simply removing a paper filter full of wet grounds.So I appreciate the free coffee maker, and I do think that if you like making French Press coffee, this is a good choice for you.

"I am not an economist, and in fact I've never even taken a course in basic econ, but over the past 6 or 7 years, I have tried to make up for that gap in my education by listening to Planet Money and Marketplace and reading Paul Krugman, along with a dozen or so books on economics in general and the crash of 2007-08 in particular. So I was interested in this book, which claims to tell us what money really is.The book covered a wide swath of history and philosophy, as well as business and finance, but it does so in as accessible a way as possible. It begins with the most fundamental question--what is money anyhow? The author uses the framing device of a conversation with a friend who is an entrepreneur and businessman, and gets the standard answer--a story about bartering, the inconvenience of exchanging chickens for bushels of wheat, and the substitution, over time, of money (coins) as a substitute for actual commodities. In this view, money is at root a thing, a commodity, and gold or silver are the real money, with paper just a less-awkward symbol of it.And then he goes on to show that this is not and never has been true. There are and never have been barter-based economies, of whatever small scale you would want to imagine. He uses the remote island of Yap, with its infamous huge stone wheel money to show that money is and always has been a social, not physical phenomenon, a way of keeping a tally of credits and debits. Money is at its root based on debt, not chickens or codfish. In the absence of money, what you find is not nature but an alternative social system, such as sacrifices made to gods and then shared by the tribe, or feudal arrangements in which one class owes certain amounts of labor to another class, which also has social obligations such as defense to those who support them. In the end of the book, he compares money to language--something which no one individual controls, but which gets its meaning and power only from social agreement as to what it means.From there, we travel through ancient Mesopotamia (which was a form of control-economy and had no money) to ancient Greece, which had a much less advanced society, but which had the concept of each member of society as being equal (allowing, of course for the fact that women and slaves were not counted as members of society--see the founding of the United States for a similar point of view.) and on to the development of trade in medieval Europe, when methods of buying and selling throughout Europe developed, requiring ways to standardize what was owed by a buyer in Belgium to a seller in Genoa.The surprise villain of the story is John Locke, who reintroduced the idea that money should be immutable and gold-like, thereby leading to the laissez-faire theories that allowed Englishmen to clear their consciences while allowing a million Irish to starve to death rather than weaken them with charity. The only good government is a small one, and the smaller the better, so that business can advance without tiresome duties to society as a whole. And now it starts to sound familiar.In the end, Mr. Martin has an aim in mind--to argue that by allowing banks to profit without control, while backing them, by necessity not only from failures of liquidity (a bank run) but also failure of capital (due to assets that were misvalued.) It is the familiar ""profits are privatized while losses are socialized,"" and his whole history of money has been pointing towards an explanation of money as always social, not a simple fact of nature. Therefore, taxing profits to protect society, or inflating money or cancelling debts in order to maintain the social order and ""liberty and justice for all"" is not some sort of unnatural act, taking from wealth-producers to give to lazy takers, as Mitt Romney would see it. Instead, money has always been a means to an end, and that end is a just society.At some points in the story, the argument becomes a bit abstract and not always easy for me to follow, though he does his best to keep it as concrete and anecdotal as possible.One point that I take from this book is that my own understanding of money as a means of keeping score is essentially correct. It makes no more sense to rail against ""fiat money"" than it does to rail against the points awarded in basketball, and to complain that those 3-pointers were made up out of thin air, and to ask, where are those points coming from?Certainly a book well worth reading, for anyone who has ever asked, What is money anyway, and how does it get started?","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG15EJP9GX9HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307962431#wasThisHelpful","RG15EJP9GX9HB","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After Jason Padgett suffered a brain injury as a result of his mugging, his personality changed from a frat-boy type to a shy, studious guy who suffered from OCD, agorphobia, and PTSD. The personality change is surprising, but the rest of that description is not. But what is most amazing is that he began to perceive mathematical patterns everywhere, and became obsessed with drawing visual representations of pi and prime numbers.This story is quite well-written, in my opinion. With the help of a co-author, Jason uses his own narrative to also fill us in on a great deal of scientific research into synesthesia (associating numbers and letters with colors, among other things), TBI (traumatic brain injury), savant syndrome, and more. The way the science is folded into the narrative is quite expert, and the book is not only a personal memoir but also a primer on many topics in neurology, told in an approachable way.What is most intriguing to me about the changes in Jason's brain is the question of whether his altered way of perceiving the world is giving us insight into the actual structure of the physical world, or only of the human brain itself. In other words, people with savant syndrome have unique and impressive skills, the ability to correctly calculate dates on the calendar in an instant, or to perceive the prime factors in a large number, or to compose complex music or draw detailed renderings of nature. But when Jason sees the matrix that underlies reality, is that because he has some unique insight, or because all human brains are attuned to the reality of the structure of the universe, or is it just a brain artifact? How is it different (or is it different?) from psychedelic-induced visions of colored music or writhing snakes?I also somewhat wish that he had waited longer to write this book. Apparently at the time of writing it, he is still a student at a local community college. As a community college professor myself, I respect the hard-working students that attend community colleges. But is he a genius? He is fascinated by math, but how good is he at it? If he were attending MIT and sharing his insights with his professors, I would be ready to believe that he is a genius, with profound new insights. Yes, it's amazing that a head injury made him *better* at math than he was before--but is he, as the cover claims, a ""mathematical marvel""? That part is not yet clear.Quibbles aside, this book is well worth reading, it it will challenge your ideas about how our minds function, as well as give you great respect for this guy's courage in overcoming the downsides to his injury.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOIMKSIHG090/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544045602#wasThisHelpful","R1NOIMKSIHG090","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have long argued that what underlies the opposition to taxes and government in general is the sense on the part of whites that government is for Them, meaning originally blacks but now also immigrants as well, especially Hispanic immigrants. So I was pleased to find this erudite scholar making the same point. His arguments are a bit abstruse, especially when he discusses the import of color-blindness and post-racialism. Color-blindness is the pretense on the part of whites, mainly conservatives but also progressives, that race doesn't even occur to them. Lopez shows how this seemingly noble point of view is actually very destructive and allows racism to continue, unacknowledged and unchallenged.I had a little more difficulty understanding his point about post-racialism, which is Obama's position. I would be hard-pressed to try to paraphrase what post-racialism means and how it is different from (false) color-blindness. As a disappointed Obama supporter, I did appreciate his clear explanation of how Obama went wrong right at the start of his presidency, by failing to openly avow liberalism and instead using the power of government to help in a crisis in such a subtle way as to strengthen the narrative that taxes are the enemy of the good life and government had best get out of the way. I agree with him in wondering just how progressive Obama really is, and to what extent his embrace of conservative ideas (such as school choice) is from the heart and how much is to avoid being seen as ""the black president.""The final chapter, in which Lopez supposedly offers ideas on where to go from here was likewise not as clear and powerful as I could have wished. His main point is to continue to speak up on race and how it is always there. As he well notes, this incites rage on the conservative side of every issue. He does a fine job of showing the racial jiu-jitsu by which conservatives manage to make it seem like it is liberals who are the real racists. But he is less clear on how his proposals will overcome this flim-flam,Well worth reading, and helpful to younger readers who do not have a personal recollection of the Nixonian Southern Strategy and the way Reagan played the dog-whistle like a master.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBIWOLHPE5AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199964270#wasThisHelpful","R3MBIWOLHPE5AF","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This longish novel starts out perfectly normal--the writing is clear and the plot line is easy to follow. Gil Martins is an FBI agent and his marriage is on the rocks. His wife leaves him because he has lost his faith in God, and her religion is that important to her. Gil is a former Catholic and more recently an evangelical, but he no longer believes any of it and has taken to reading books about atheism.But then about three-quarters of the way through the book, it just takes a turn towards the supernatural and the unbelievable, and the whole thing falls apart. It gets quite scary for a while, but in the end, it is just plain unsatisfying.I don't know who would like this book--it has plenty to offend Catholics and evangelicals, but it also will not work for atheists either, Heck, even the FBI would probably find it disturbing. I don't know whether Philip Kerr wants us to take his thesis seriously, or if it's part of his actual argument for atheism. He concludes the book with several pages of biblical quotes, supporting his view of God as essentially demonic.Since I am a former Catholic and former evangelical who has also lost faith, I was with him most of the way, but then this just went way off the rails. Even the writing got bad, as people do the things they do in horror movies--is there something scary going on? Well how about if I walk out of the relative safety of my house and wander around outside in the dark, where, of course, my cellphone has no reception, and oh darn, I lost my gun in that fall I took and the electricity is out, so it's pitch dark, except for that glowing light where a demon is glaring at me.Sorry, not a prayer here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R310V20DJL13DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039916765X#wasThisHelpful","R310V20DJL13DO","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It does take a bit of nerve for a white Southern woman to write in the voice of an African-American slave, but Oprah is on board with it, and I think she makes it work. The historical aspects of this book, with the real names of real people, Sarah and Angelina Grimke, the main characters, Lucretia Mott, Denmark Vesey, William LLoyd Garrison, blends seamlessly with the wholly imagined parts, the lives of the enslaved women. Kidd manages to capture the style of both the young woman who is supposed to ""own"" a slave and the equally young woman who is enslaved, and she makes them both believable. The connection she makes between the slavery experienced not only by enslaved people but also by women could be offensive, but I think she makes her case that the lack of voice, the lack of choices, the lack of educational opportunities, and the inability to own property in their own names that even upper-class women experienced was, in its own way, a form of oppression that, while not the equal of what enslaved women experienced, was also true oppression,. Even her inability to extricate herself from slave-owning is oppressive to Sarah Grimke.My one disappointment with the book was the abrupt way it ended. I was reading it on a kindle, and I had no sense that I was nearing the end, and suddenly I turned the page to find out what happened next, and it was the author's note.

"This book straddles the line between psychological thriller and a more literary genre, and it works as both. The quiet voice of the first section, as we are inside the head of the headmaster, who is speaking in first person, calmly and seemingly rationally about quite irrational and shocking behavior, is eerie and tension building. Than the point of view shifts, in a way that is puzzling and fascinating, and the story is told again, the same but utterly different. And finally, the denouement makes sense of it all, but leaves you still a bit dazed.The setting is elegant and charming, and the characters are superbly well-drawn. The writing style is smooth and flawless. This is one of those books that you want to stay up late to finish, but you also don't want it to end. Just a great piece of writing. I will be looking into Thomas Christopher Greene's previous books, because this one is first-rate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR780KQ2XE71D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250038944#wasThisHelpful","RR780KQ2XE71D","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a mesmerizing story! No, really! The twists and turns of this murder story kept me totally engrossed. It is hard, at times, to believe that this is fact, not fiction, because the story seems so unlikely--a rotting corpse is found, and after painstaking (and smelly) investigation, it is determined that it is the man who has famously gone missing from Paris. Why was there so much press attention to this murder? Why is so much detail still available, over 100 years later? It's hard to say, but the story is completely captivating and compelling.The crux of the story is the personality of Gabrielle Bompard, the ""little demon"" of the title, and she also seems more like a character from fiction than any character from real life, and yet every detail is backed up by detailed research. In her early 20s, tiny and undeveloped enough to pass herself off as a young boy from time to time, yet alluring enough to captivate both the murderer and the murder victim, as well as all of France--who *is* this vixen?And was she a hysteric (a psychological malady that was all the vogue in last Victorian, or Belle Epoque, times) or was she in fact the hypnotically-controlled puppet of a vicious madman? How did a proper young lady, raised mainly in convents after her mother died and her father took up with the governess, end up roaming the streets of Paris alone and becoming the mistress of the unappealing M. Eyraud, a professional con-man more than twice her age? Or is it possible that she was the mastermind, controlling him?And can a person be hypnotized so thoroughly that she will commit murder on command? Shades of the Manchurian candidate!The writing in this book is top-notch, the narrative never flags, and the atmosphere of France in the 1890s is entertaining. A worthy companion to the similarly named and similarly well-written Devil in the White City, about murder in Chicago of the same era.I loved it, and you will too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YW9PPG4PO2UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536038#wasThisHelpful","R2YW9PPG4PO2UR","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book, by the great-nephew of MFK Fisher, captures a time and place and a lifestyle that is quite entrancing to imagine. Fisher, an early-to-mid 20th century food writer, spent several months with her sister in Provence France, and mingled with Julia and Paul Child, James Beard, and several other notable food authorities, while considering her relationship with France and the French way of life and eating. This one season in 1970 was a turning point for her personally and for several of the other writers as well. They had been extolling the glories of France and the French approach to food and to life for decades, but their writing had had an influence on America, and thus the superiority of all things French and the inferiority of everything American was no longer quite so true--America had learned a lot and was beginning to value good food too, so what was the point of a rather elitist and nostalgic clinging to all things French?The book is an almost moment-by-moment (and bite-by-bite) account of the events in Fisher's time in France, as well as equally detailed accounts of what James Beard, Richard Olney, and the Childs were up to, based on the detailed, daily letters and journals many of them kept. Barr documents every sentence, indicating his source for every recollection of a fish stew or lemon tart. The writing is smooth and elegant, although there is some repetition as we see the same scene from different points of view, or in anticipation and then in recollection. The story from 1970 is framed by an introduction and conclusion set in the present, as Barr re-visits the places his family once lived.There are no recipes, per se, and this is certainly not a travel guide. It is a remembrance of things past, a third-person memoir, and quite entertaining as that. It does inspire a desire to make a good bouillabaisse and sit out on the patio and eat it slowly with friends, while drinking good wine and talking on into the night!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J3L06UBSOWP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307718344#wasThisHelpful","R3J3L06UBSOWP0","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"See warning at the end of the review!First of all, I borrowed this for free through Amazon Prime, after reading Moonwalking with Einstein. That book showed that an average person can memorize (which is not quite the same thing as remember) a surprising amount of material, through a specific technique called the Memory Palace. I had heard about this method before, and gave it a half-hearted try, but like many people, I felt that it was too much trouble--learning a bunch of random stuff in order to learn the actual target material seemed like twice as much work.But even half-hearted attempts seemed to work, at least for a while.And after reading the Moonwalking book, I figured, why not? I'm 61 years old, my Dad just died of Alzheimer's this year, anything that can give my brain a workout is worth a try.The plus of this book is that instead of explaining the memory palace technique, it just jumps right in and demonstrates it. It does all the imaginative work of walking you through a scenario with the crazy associations elaborated for you in print. And if you pay attention, form clear mental images as you go, and have a few functioning brain cells, it should take.What I found is that after one reading, I did *not* have all 37 of Shakespeare's plays committed to memory. But what went wrong was very illuminating, because the ones I screwed up were the ones that I didn't really put in a specific enough location in the first place. The parts that I imagined clearly were firmly imprinted. The ones where I went, ""Ok, corner of my street, wait, no, maybe the next street would be better, um, ok, let's say the house next door...""--those slipped away. But the corner of my bedroom, the door to the bathroom, the front porch, in front of the movie theatre, those were as clear as a bell.So I see that indeed, this system will allow me, with some practice, and mostly, with clear image-making (imagining) in the first place, to memorize lists of various things.I must admit that I am an English major and college English teacher, and I couldn't have told you even how many plays Shakespeare wrote, much less which one was first, or last, or how many of those damn Henrys he wrote. And now I can. (Also, Dickens wrote a couple of books I've never heard of.)I was on Jeopardy about 7 years ago, and I tried to learn all the presidents, using another method, but I never got them all in place. Now I think I will finally, with some time and effort, get my presidents straight.So yeah, the book is short, there are a couple of grammatical oddities, but it's worth $3.99 for sure if you're interested in using this method to memorize things.EDIT: WARNING! Do not memorize the list of presidents given here! John Tyler and James K. Polk are missing! (They belong between Wm. H. Harrison and Zachary Taylor). Maybe the author's memory failed him? Maybe he really does need an editor? Now I wonder if the list of Shakespeare plays that I have memorized is actually correct! (Gotta remove one star for this error.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C8D3XYSH64E3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007V3FLTE#wasThisHelpful","R3C8D3XYSH64E3","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The facts that are reported in this book are undoubtedly correct--the corporate culture of America is a mess, with exhibits from Madoff to Goldman Sachs to prove the point. And the solution will require people to start behaving better.But this book annoyed me from start to finish. First, let's look at the price of the book--the list price is $39.95, discounted at amazon to $27.95, and available as a kindle edition for $19.99! For a book that claims to advocate the virtues of thrift and the decadence of highly-paid executives, that's way out of line! But if the book had included real research, maybe I would be willing to pay the price, However, it doesn't. The main part of the book is a re-hash of articles from websites available for free. Many chapters have notes that go on with ibid, ibid, ibid for pages--in other words, they're just restating what someone else already wrote. In addition, the editing is pitiful. Rivier College is referred to as River college, vicious circles are called viscous circles, and Lehman Brothers is spelled both correctly and as Leman Brothers in the same paragraph. The English usage is also frequently awkward and cliched. If you're going to write a book about the importance of integrity, hard work, and personal responsibility, I would hope that you would show a little more integrity than this, for $40! (Full disclosure: I received this book for free in exchange for an unbiased review.)Then, there's the intro, or rather one of several intros, in which we are treated to a lecture delivered by Sir John Marks Templeton on how capitalism and Christianity go hand in hand. Templeton (known for his Templeton Prize) also states (falsely, I believe) that capitalism, or ""the capitalist institutions of property, trade, and cooperation"" have always existed. In fact, capitalism is dependent on the ability to lend money for interest, a practice which was condemned as usury by the Judeo-Christian tradition that both Templeton and the authors of this book claim to champion.The next intro sets up the thesis of the book, which is that the root of our problem today, and the cause of the 2008 financial crisis, is the 7 deadly sins. The authors go through quite a few contortions trying to demonstrate that various sins, such as gluttony, pride, lust, and of course plain old greed are the reason that the economy tanked. They add moralistic terms such as these to their narratives over and over again. For example, in discussing Madoff, it's not enough to say that the guy was greedy. His besetting sin is diagnosed as lust, because he had topless waitresses at parties he threw. Gluttony is the charge against corporations that conducted too many corporate mergers. And so on. If someone is going to turn out to be a bad guy, even his youthful successes will be described as ""prideful"" or ""greedy"" or ""gluttonous.""In some cases, their accusations don't even make sense. They condemn Bear Stearns for exhibiting pride by hiring a guy named Jimmy Cayne on the basis of his bridge-playing ability. It was Cayne who brought about the destruction of this formerly great company, because he didn't have the right kind of education to lead a company--even though they themselves also note that Cayne was hired in 1969, and the company had its first quarterly loss in 2007! Undoubtedly, Cayne, and Bear Stearns, were derelict in focusing on a bridge tournament when the company was circling the drain. But if the guy worked there since 1969, surely he had acquired a few skills along the way, and whatever it was that he was doing seemed to work for 38 years! Yet they end the chapter by saying that ""Cayne's hiring alone demonstrates that the firm was long on bravado and short on rational pragmatism.""The final section of the book, in which the authors offer ""a way back"" comes across as simplistic and naive. The primary author, who gives his name as Theodore Roosevelt Malloch, is eager to point out that he is ""a distant relative"" of President Theodore Roosevelt, and he thinks that TR is a useful model to look to. Mr. T. R. Malloch has what sound like very respectable credentials, but it's hard to take seriously a section heading called ""A Dummies' Guide to Save the SEC"" that takes up less than a page of the book. They criticize the SEC for calling in (and paying for) consulting firms, and offer to do the job for free! Their handy bit of wisdom can be boiled down to two things--hire smarter people and pay them better, and create an ""ethics hotline."" All right then.They also give us the following in-depth analysis of theories of prosperity and wealth creation:""1. Wealth is viewed as the product of magic, alchemy, or wizadry, poof!""2. Prosperity is the product of tribal or national conquest. Guess what? You have it and I am taking it.""3. Prosperity is rooted in the value of human creative capacity"" (p. 224)No, really, those are their exact words. I'll take door #3, of course! But does this go any ways towards explaining why the creative capacity in Haiti and the Congo seems to get people so much less than the creative capacity of Wall Street traders? Does it explain why the creativity of trash pickers in India, and our own inner cities, leaves people still impoverished, while a clever guy like Jamie Dimon gets rich? (Interestingly, they praise Dimon on p. 200-201 as showing shrewdness and good judgment, despite the fact that he's hardly a paragon of their favorite virtue, thrift, with (according to Wikipedia) ""$23 million pay package for fiscal year 2011, more than any other bank CEO in the United States.""Between the moralizing, the bad writing, and the simplistic solutions offered to complex problems, I found this book endlessly aggravating. Even the title is silly--""The End of Ethics""? What the heck is that supposed to mean? Were people really just of better character back in the 1950s--or did the system have different incentives, and more equitable laws and tax structures? By putting the emphasis on individual character and virtue or vice (words they use over and over again), they take attention away from the lack of regulation that has allowed such ""vice"" to flourish, although in the end, they prescribe better regulation, not more morality. They themselves are at pains to point out the bad guys' religious backgrounds, and lots of them are noted as being Jewish, but when a Catholic goes astray, it is noted as somehow an anomaly--despite his Catholic education, this guy fell prey to vices.Still not convinced that this is a shoddy book? Ok, have a look at p. 233, in which they discuss ""the paradox of thrift."" They explain this important phrase as being ""a raging debate"" about whether there is ""some magic number or formulae (sic) for the level of savings in a given country."" They contrast Adam Smith's appreciation for thrift as a virtue with John Maynard Keynes's position that ""a high savings rate [is] far from a virtue."" No one who  doesn't already understand what underlies the paradox of thrift, namely that if everyone stops spending at once, it will make everyone poorer, since your spending is my income and vice versa, will come away any the wiser. They don't want to explain the paradox of thrift, because they want to convince you that the reason our economy is a mess is because crass people got greedy and spent too much money, not that there could be anything fundamentally wrong with capitalism.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24UTJRRKZQDH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111855017X#wasThisHelpful","R24UTJRRKZQDH3","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We all know the stories of WW2, the men and women of the Greatest Generation, maturing so young and fighting against Hitler, and returning to the US quietly to take up their life with the psychic wounds battened down. But it had never occurred to me that thousands of men deserted from the front lines in Europe, and that some of them lived as bandits, stealing from the US Army (leaving their own comrades short of supplies on the front lines) and selling their stolen goods on the black market. Yet that is the story this book tells.Only one man in the US Army was executed for desertion, but many more walked away from combat, got separated from their units, sometimes went AWOL *towards* the front lines rather than away from them, took up with prostitutes or other young women, hid in farmhouses, joined the French resistance or the French Foreign Legion, or ran riot through the streets of Paris. This is an engrossing tale. In the process of telling it, Charles Glass gives a clearer picture than most books of what life as a soldier in combat was actually like in WW2.Unfortunately for me, I had a hard time keeping track of the overlapping stories of several different men whose lives are narrated herein. I spread the reading of the book out over several weeks, and if I had made more of an effort, I could have followed the plot line more clearly.A couple of details stand out to me in this story--as a member of the Japanese-American community, I am struck by the fact that the famous Nisei 442 battalion recorded not a single desertion. I am also struck by the disproportionate punishments given to African-American soldiers who committed crimes while in uniform.And on a contemporary note, I am struck by the fact that Great Britain offered amnesty to all troops who had deserted during the war. Their crime was clearly much greater than the ""crime"" of those who come to the United States seeking work and a better life, and yet amnesty was chosen as the wisest course because it would allow them to be restored as functioning members of society, rather than living a shadowy existence without legal right to work.This book also made me realize that it is not impossible that some of the MIA from the Vietnam War may indeed have made the choice to disappear into a life with a Vietnamese wife. And how much easier it was for soldiers in Europe to blend in and simply taken on a new identity.In any case, this is a fascinating book and I am glad it was written while at least one of the men Glass writes about is still alive to tell his side of the tale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D55J7SJZQRZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204284#wasThisHelpful","R2D55J7SJZQRZ0","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this kindle book for free, in exchange for an honest review. The honest truth is that when I get something free, I tend not to rush to read it. But once I started this one, I had a hard time stopping. It caught and kept my interest.However, it's not a great book. The premise is a bit far-fetched, and there are many coincidences in the plot to make it work. Also, a lot of the exposition comes through long letters which the conspirators write to each other and encode, in which they tell each other all the background and the whole plot. This is not believable to me.But it does make one think--is there a method behind all the conspiracy theory madness?I was more than a little confused by Ted Kuzinski's role in the story (he's the Unibomber but he seemed to be a good guy here.)And yes, there's some hot sex here, though the fact that the main character and presumably alter-ego of the author is the one that the incredibly sexy hooker falls in love with was a bit creepy.And the very last page of the book seems to imply that the author actually fears for his life--he refuses to say anything about himself except that he's an adult male.

"When you entitle a longish book about a long road trip ""The Longest Road,"" you have to be prepared for the possibility that the reader will want out of the car somewhere along the way! But this book kept me interested all the way from the end (or beginning) of the road in Key West, Florida, to the end of the country above the Arctic Circle in Prudhoe Bay,Alaska. The conceit of the book is that Caputo set out, not in search of himself, or even of America, but of the answer to the question: What (if anything) holds the 50 diverse states together? What is the Unum of the E Pluribus, as he puts it one time.So, like any book of this sort, the real interest is not so much in the descriptions of the scenery (though that is well-done) but of the conversations the author has with people along the way. In this regard, Philip Caputo seems like a decent companion. He manages to meet and mingle not only with ""folksy"" sorts, and not only with angry conservatives or liberals, but with a meaningful cross-section of Americans, if there can be such a thing (which is pretty much the underlying question here.)  If you are a strong conservative, you might not enjoy Caputo's company entirely, since he is a mellow sort of liberal who also happened to have served in combat in Vietnam (and apparently written a seminal book about it, though I hadn't heard of him or it previously.)Like any such book, there are the usual comments on marital harmony or lack therof along the way, though only a little, and there are the particular details of the travel itself, the repairs needed, the challenges of sleeping in a trailer, etc. But I found less of this self-reflection in the book, and more of an outward focus, on the places and people Philip and his wife met along the way. I have no desire to travel so many miles (over 8,300, and that's not counting the drive to Key West to start, nor the drive back to Texas to drop off the trailer!)My favorite road book of all time is Full Tilt (Ireland to India by bicycle!) and other books by the indefatigable Dervla Murphy, and this doesn't quite live up to that level, but it beats many an ""across the USA to find ___"" because Caputo is an amiable and observant companion who asks good questions and records the answers faithfully. (I certainly liked it better than Peking to Paris, which told a similar story, with way too much attention to the writer's own self-image.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29GDSHBLU9AW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805094466#wasThisHelpful","R29GDSHBLU9AW3","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple of chapters into this book, I was asking myself, ""How have I never heard of this writer before?"" And before even finishing the book, I was ordering is previous work (Driving Mr. Albert) simply because I didn't want this book to end. This is a masterpiece, on a level with Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air or Richard Preston's The Hot Zone, in which it doesn't matter that you had no previous interest in Mount Everest or biological warfare, or in  this case, Spanish cheese.Paterniti takes a more or less simple story of a farmer in Spain who creates a fantastic cheese and then, through mismanagement, loses the company he has built, and turns it into a reflection on how life is to be lived, how it feels to be a young father, what is worth living for, how time changes, and yet doesn't change, everything. He has a huge man-crush on this guy whose language he doesn't even speak at first, and he manages to spend so much time with him that he falls completely under his spell, bringing his wife and kids not once but twice, to spend weeks in a dessicated village in Spain.Life in the village of Guzman is everything that life in modern America is not. People spend their time in rooms that Paterniti calls Telling Rooms, caves, actually out on the hillside, where wine flows freely (wine they themselves have made) and food is shared lovingly with friend and stranger alike. No ""stranger danger"" here, no hours spent before screens ""chatting"" electronically with disembodied strangers. This is life as it has been for centuries. And yet, it is also real, not a stage-setting put on for the benefit of lost americanos who always go home to their clothes driers and air conditioners and ipads. And yet, beneath this hypnotic surface, there are also ancient (or not so ancient) hatreds that can never be explained, much less resolved. It is village life at its most comforting and also its most claustrophobic. And somehow, Paterniti allows us to experience it.It took him over a decade to write the book, and a fair amount of the story is about writing the book, or more accurately, being unable to write the book. Although a journalist, and a very successful one, writing long-form journalism for magazines, Paterniti can't find an ending, can't bring himself to commit the story to paper in only one way. In the end, there are ironic footnotes at length and much self-referential spinning of wheels. And yet, it is a book of great sincerity and honesty.I loved it. Your book club will love it. I hope it will be a best-seller. Both author and publisher deserve it, as do the people of Guzman.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35MZFT3SD4B33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385337000#wasThisHelpful","R35MZFT3SD4B33","A1157CR0T5UM9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1157CR0T5UM9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hopefully someone else can make good use of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHRBP7Y2Q050S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00746WZHE#wasThisHelpful","RHRBP7Y2Q050S","A39TF3CW0JEK3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39TF3CW0JEK3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start by saying this phone is amazing.This is my 6th windows phone in a span of 1 year. I keep phone maximum for 3 months and sell it with good value. Earlier i had Lumia 1020 which is amazing phone too. I was in market for a mini ipad.Then i came across this phone . So i thought why not buy Lumia 1520 which can be used as a mini tablet and phone.I have no regrets in buying this phone. Below is my experience with this phone.Form Factor: Yes phone is little big. As this is a phablet category, the size is expected.We cant have a SUV's room in a compact car. So the benefits of large screen is obvious. Also at the same time there will be some inconvinience.Both Hands: Yes most times you need to use both hands. For instance, you cant use back button without using 2nd hand. But i got used to it.After couple weeks ownership , i dont feel this as a inconvinience any more. It matters most in a CAR where you need to handle the phone single handed. So all the time i mount my phone and i can use single hand.Screen: Screen is great and retina. But if you use phone screen without any protector then the screen is very slippery.Camera: Didnt test much but looks as good as lumia 1020 with less zoom.Slim. This phone is very slim when compared to lumia 1020. there is no bulge on the back so it sits flat.I se phone for movies at gym. Lumia 1020's camera bulge was always a chalange at gym. As 1520 sits flat, it is more secure.Speed: I dont think i see much speed improvement over 1020. Though it is quad core ,system still takes time to repsond on certain apps.I believe the speed has to do with particular apps then the phones hardware.When i switched to 1520 ,i thought some lagging in 1020 will be gone in 1520/. but certains apps still lagg.Lanyard: I miss Lanyard of lumia 1020 in this phablet. As this is a big phone, Nokia must have Lanyard option. To remedy this, i added my own . I used incipio air case and added Lanyard to the speaker grill. It works great as the case is strong.Speakers:It is almost same as lumia 1020 speaker with 10-15% improvement in volume. The clarity is same. Both speakers are great. Ear piece could be louder. I dont know but Nokia Lumia series suffers with low ear piece volume.Red Lumia. Red is slippery as every one suggested. Incipio case took care of it.Tiles: Extra column for tiles is a plus. Now one can see more information without moving the screen.Side Keys: Side keys are too flat. It is quite difficult to find volume keys and lock keys .It could be better like lumia 1020.Phone in public: Yes it is eye catching. It doesnt look good if you talk on this phablet in public. But who cares.when Iphone first came, it looked too BIG. but it has become new NORM now. So people will get used to it as phablets become more popular.Also it keep you out of crowd.Pocket: It easily slides into pocket. In my formals and jeans i have no issue in sliding the phone. It fits and doesnt pop out of pocket. As it is slim, the extra length doesnt bother me.Wireless charging. I am really mad on ATT on removing wireless charging from this phone. Hell with the technology and standards. IF they care too much then why did they sell qi wireless chargers. Now that every one got one qi wireless chargers they removed this from phone.ATT ------ in this regard.battery: Awesome. It has very good battery life.It is almost twice that of lumia 1020. I tested battery by turning on everything.Even though the location was turned on, the battery drain was not significant. I believe if location is not used by any app then system turns it off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34TCVH2Q5OH0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GANFYV6#wasThisHelpful","R34TCVH2Q5OH0C","A39TF3CW0JEK3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39TF3CW0JEK3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Initially i was skeptical to purchase this for lumia 1520. As this phone is tall and heavy when compared to iphone 5, i was not sure this mount will work. Earlier i purchased similar mount for lumia 1020 which failed. Reason for failure was the big camera which doesnt have enough room for the back metal plate.This time lumia 1520 has enough room for metal plate.So i tried again. To my surprise the mount holds th ephone strong though not super strong. If my car hits a big bump or hole, so i am sure the phone may fall.But for daily use i dont have nay issue. So i attached one lanyard to my phone and hook it if i go for long distance. For daily use this works best.

"Not worth the price Tag. Below are main difference between HSB800 And HSB 730.I am factoring price in rating this product.No complaints on sound .1 Noise cancellation: Though this headset got built in noise cancellation, but its not significant and doesnt justify the price. When playing music both headset performs equally. But when there is no music hsb800 handles noise better.But i dont think this is as good as full size headsets.2 Design: Hsb 800 got some design changes. They have placed the volume buttons and forward buttons to the side of headset where as its on top of hsb 730. the size of buttons are very minimal and makes it difficult to find when not looking directly. So i prefer control buttons hsb 730. Once used to it ,i guess it doesnt make much difference among these two.3 SOUND JBL Signature: I feel either there is no JBL signature on hsb 800 or it was already implemented on hsb 730. For me i didnt get any difference among these 2 headsets in regard to sound quality.4 Price: I will buy this for the price of 69 but any thing more makes the upgrades insignificant.So i prefer hsb 730 for 40$ then 129 price of hsb 800.5 Battery: there is no difference in battery consumption. Both headsets gives 10 hours play back.6 Weight. May be this is lighter. but hsb 730 also never reminded me of weight. So even weight reduced but it may not makes any difference.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27LQFLJUDHN3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FXBYHOG#wasThisHelpful","R27LQFLJUDHN3N","A39TF3CW0JEK3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39TF3CW0JEK3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As always, my all phones get Fosmon screen protector.So far all Fosmon protectors are almost 2 mm short of screen size. This is required as nokia phones are curved at the edges and if the screen protector is not short then it will not stick to screen at the edges.Fosmon screens are crystal clear but attracts finger prints easily.StillI am happy as the clarity is great if cleaned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34VU5269RL02O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GU1CPAQ#wasThisHelpful","R34VU5269RL02O","A39TF3CW0JEK3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39TF3CW0JEK3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As title says, initially I owned iphone for over 5 years. I owned all iphones except the first one. Last year, just for change, I sold iphone 5 and bought used lumia 900 cyan. It was a great change after owning iphone for years. I still remember the clear black display and glossy curved screen. Within 2 months I bought lumia 920 off eBay before release. I used it for 4 months and was very happy with everything except the weight. I usually keep my phone in upper shirt pocket ,so I always felt lumia 920s weight. This year I sold Lumia 920 and bought HTC One. Great Phone, great resolution, stable OS, great speaker etc.Recently in Amazon Deals I found lumia 520 for 79 dollars without contract. Amazon has made one click too easy. So without thinking I just clicked.I got the phone within one day.My notes on this phone:Stable OS. I love windows 8. Clean OS and a good change from ios and android. Once it gets good apps then I think It will be on top soon.Great looks and availability of swappable multi color back covers.Awesome battery life. It reminds me olden days. I always used the battery saver mode. I charged this phone 3 days ago and it has some 35% left. I have to admit I didn't use it more than an hour for past 3 days. But doing the same with my HTC One, the battery will be dead in just 1 day. May be non availability of LTE runs it longer.Screen is good but not great. Though the resolution is almost same as lumia 900 ,I feel lumia 900 screen is much better than this one.The PPI on this phone is more then lumia 900 but lumia 900 screen looked sharp.I never found pixels in lumia 900. In this phone certain colors clearly shows pixels. The color of screen does makes difference. Green colors show pixels more then blue.If you planning to cut SIM and use it then be careful. I think the thickness of regular SIM  gives very tight fit on this phone. Though micro Sims slips very easily.Camera is not great. It's an average camera for basic photography.Price is unbeatable. Spend 3 dollars and its unlocked.I didnt feel there is any signal problem on this phone. You can hold any ways unlike iphone.Speaker is average. Sound is just enough.Voice is clear over conversation.Overall i recommend this phone for the low price.Can be a great secondary phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EDOF3U0NS8TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E45043A#wasThisHelpful","R2EDOF3U0NS8TM","A39TF3CW0JEK3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39TF3CW0JEK3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept was neat but poorly implemented. I was always fan of Sony because their products are always classy and stylish. Last year when this allinone first came, i sold my Imac for this. But due to Non availability, i bought latest Imac at that time. This year again i looked for allinone w8 machines and i found this. I bought it but not happy with it. The resolution is deal breaker for me. I can clearly see pixels every where .Those who are not sensitive to this may not find it deal breaker but for me it was. Also the system is not much stable and touch was not sensitive enough. Another annoying is the weight. If dell xps 18 could manage everything in under 6 pounds then why not this.

I say the typing with this skin on will reduce the performance by 5% around.For very fast typers may be this an issue but for most casual users its no way going to be a problem. The skin should be more sticky. Right now when you type the keys on skin moves around 1 mm.As said its not an issue except the feel that there is skin on the keyboard.

"I guess I got the last one, because they're now unavailable. I just purchase a new iPhone 6 and one of the issues with this model is they can slip out of your hand quite easily, and you don't want to be dropping your expensive phone. So my first order of business was to acquire some decent protection for it. A case..... or two.... or three... or four. OK. I went a little overboard.And this was really supposed to be kind of a joke (my GF hates camo). And it was only $2.99, with free shipping. Looking at Loggerhead's page, I notice that free shipping is now in navailable as well.So why review this cheap case?  Because, although inexpensive, it's not really cheap. It has a hard plastic shell with a silicone rubber lining that makes gripping it easier and protection extends to the corners, with a slight lip that helps protect the screen. Its squarish shape kind of makes it look like a larger iPhone 5. Not as stylish, but might appeal to those who find the 6 a bit too slippery with its smooth, slim rounded edges. Even the opening to display the Apple logo has clear plastic protecting the phone.The camo design is made of thick vinyl, and is the only thing that makes it kind of cheap looking. The only other drawback is the recess for the switch to mute the phone is kind of deep making reaching it a bit difficult.So, one star off for the cheapish looking graphics. But otherwise a good case offering adequate drop protection, good fit, and OK design.A very satisfying purchase considering I wasn't expecting much for three bucks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20PKFQYNAIRIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01092BZKC#wasThisHelpful","R20PKFQYNAIRIJ","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've updated your iDevice to iOS 9, plan on a big pain getting this to work without a spare PC to do a firmware update. And you don't know this when you get the message to grant access in 'Settings' for something you'll never find there. But let's assume you've done the firmware update and your intention was to move content on you device to the drive to free up space on the device. It's not like plugging in a flash drive. This thing has too many problems and too many drawbacks.First issue: syncing. It really doesn't. Photos and videos you can move and delete from your device. But that's about it. I don't know about restoring them because I updated to iOS 9 before I had a chance to try. And you're limited to your camera roll. Any other photos can be copied to the drive, but not deleted from the device. And photos is about it. Music is a whole other an of worms.Next issue: Power. Since the drive uses the Lightning port, you're limited to what your battery can provide while this thing is plugged in. And although I can't be sure since it was only used for a short time before iOS 9 was installed, I assume it will be an additional power drain.So if you planned on using the drive as a temporary storage space, think twice. Or keep a computer with iTunes handy. And if you have a PC with iTunes, do you really need this drive?I purchased this drive when the price dropped significantly for a short time and it's going back to Amazon. This drive just won't do what the description leads you to expect it would do. It doesn't unload music from your device. And it only unloads photos and videos taken with the device (i.e. Camera Roll and videos. Nothing that was synced with iTunes from your library). So, when my 64GB had 1.5GB free before the drive, it had 1.6GB free after moving what I could. None of my 20 gigs of music or 15 gigs of photos from my computer.So I upgraded my iPhone to one with 128GB, and goodbye flash drive. I suppose if you have limited storage and you want to store pictures you take with your phone on it, maybe. But as a media library with movies and readily available content on it, don't get your hopes up.A big disappointment, at any price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG4E2UBZCDR1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBGU4WM#wasThisHelpful","RG4E2UBZCDR1K","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I normally only buy items sold or fulfilled by Amazon. But since I couldn't find this from Amazon, I took a chance. Big mistake!What's wrong with this ring? First, sizing. I normally wear 10 1/2, so figured an 11 would fit. Nope! Partly because it seems to be sized small, but also because it is wide and flat, and has sharp edges. Secondly, the sharp edges. When the edges aren't cutting into me, the defective links are poking into my finger.I'd consider exchanging it for a size 12, but there are no guarantees it wouldn't have the same problems. And reading the fine print, free shipping is only free if you keep it. Return it and they'll deduct an unknown amount, which added on to the return postage will probably get me nothing for a refund.Lesson learned. If it isn't Prime eligible, you roll the dice. Even with vendors whose name I've seen on a lot of products.Very unhappy with this purchase. Caveat emptor.UPDATE Sept. 30, 2015 - Although this is a product review, my initial problems involved sizing and defects that, because it was not fulfilled by Amazon, would have been non-economical to get replaced. When I went to leave less than stellar vendor feedback, it was suggested (by the system) that I contact the vendor first. I did, complaining that postage and handling would not be worthwhile to even return the defective ring of an $8 item. The vendor (Sabrina Jewelry) responded, offering to replace the ring with the proper size and send a return envelope. They did, and the replacement arrived today. No sharp edges. And although a size larger than I normally wear, it fits well.So I am revising my rating to 4 stars, with the recommendation that (probably due to the design being wide and flat), if you order this item, go one size up from what you normally wear. I wear 10 1/2-11, and this is size 12","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KK4LYHSHP9XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037B27D2#wasThisHelpful","R1KK4LYHSHP9XZ","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But $19 is not a huge investment for an attractive wedding band and one that I won't likely be wearing on my wedding day.So, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase, and have absolutely no complaints of the product or vendor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y281L4BK54VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4MERVC#wasThisHelpful","R1Y281L4BK54VZ","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought spending more and buying a Coleman chair would get me a better product. It was partially true. But this $25 chair was not a whole lot better than the ones you can find for $7 at Big Lots. The material is slightly better. The frame is a bit larger.But this is not at all as comfortable as I expected for the extra money they cost. The cooler and cup holder are no bonus features. Your drink still won't sit upright. And the cooler won't keep the next one cooler until you drink it.Is it bad? No. But put it next to one that costs a quarter of the price and you may be hard pressed to find a difference.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CAOHSS13JZYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00339C3RI#wasThisHelpful","R2CAOHSS13JZYB","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't know if these are sized small expecting the 'stretch' material to compensate. Or like a lot of Asian made clothes, just sized wrong.I wear a 36"" waist. So I ordered size 36. After checking the label to see if they sent the wrong size I packed them back up to send back.Now the question was, did I get the one pair that was sewn wrong. Or, was the sizing way off. I have 34"" pants that fit looser than these. So, I decided to go with the theory that they just sized these pants wrong and got a pair of 38"" pants. As expected, they fit like a pair of 36"" pants should.They're nice jeans. Soft and comfortable. No bizarre names with acid, stone, indigo, or a dozen other shades. They're bluejeans. Not too dark. Not uneven. Not bleached. Not tapered, boot cut, relaxed fit, skinny.... Just plain old jeans, with a little spandex in them for unknown reasons. You can't feel them stretch.So, for $25, you can get yourself a nice pair of jeans. I've given up expecting Levi's to make a pair of 501s that are going to be the same as the last pair I bought. Or why they charge $160 in one store and $30 in another. Although I wouldn't doubt that the $160 pair went through more stringent quality control than the cheaper ones.But gone are the days where there were 501s (505s, if you didn't like button fly) and a few others. There are now no fewer than two dozen five hundred series Levi's. And you don't get the same ones depending on who you buy them from.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RREGY4USI3D3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KXEV8C#wasThisHelpful","RREGY4USI3D3V","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted something to be able to turn on or off a light from another room. I didn't need an expensive wifi connected device that would control a light in Pennsylvania from my car in Texas.These do exactly what I need. They work from up to 100 feet away on anything that will go off or on by cutting the power at the plug. What I mean by that is if you have a light that has a switch that has to be used if power is lost, these won't work. It has to be something that will go back on when power is reconnected.The other limitation is you can control up to five devices, or sets of devices. Each remote has ten buttons. Five on and five off. Programming is easy. You press a button on the controlled socket and then the remote. When I say sets of devices, I mean you can have as many sockets as you want controlled by each of the five remote codes. So you can have ten sockets programmed to one pair of buttons. And with one button turn on ten different lamps. But if you only want to turn on five lamps, you have to use a different pair of remote buttons.But for the price, given the ability to control five different sets of circuits, that's a lot of capability to have from your bedside. And you don't even have to clap. ;-)And with multiple remotes, you can have them in convenient locations. One by your bed. One by the front door to turn on lights when you get home. I have a fan controlled by one. Spouse and I each have a remote so either of us can control the fan as needed.It does what I need. It works well at long distances without line of sight requirement. Don't take up a lot of space. Easy to program. And they even include an extra set of batteries for the remotes. What more could you ask. They even work when your router has crashed. Which adds another capability. Companies make expensive devices to reboot routers to keep them working efficiently. Hook one of these up to your router or modem and every now and then shut it off and back on to clean things up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS931ZPSQRCNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAII824#wasThisHelpful","RS931ZPSQRCNH","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Be aware with this series of plugs that wires are not held in with set screws. They are fed through a tube and the stripped portion of the wire doubled back over the tube and held in place when the end cap is screwed on. Not a very good description, but I don't know how else to describe it.With this design, they will work best with 12 gauge wire, or maybe 14. Smaller gauge wire will not fit snugly enough to work as well. Although it may fit, a cheaper series would probably function better.The plugs are also rather wide. So if space is a consideration, you might want to consider a different series or brand.I bought these because they were on sale. Otherwise I would have bought something cheaper. After all, the main requirement is just to get good contact at the end of a speaker wire. If you're using quality heavy gauge wire these would be a good fit. If you're using cheapo 18 gauge, it's like putting $300 Pirellis on a Yugo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GSZ6BY7AFDHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J3CJT0#wasThisHelpful","R1GSZ6BY7AFDHY","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It only took a mouthful to decide that these were going back. The idea seemed good, but I didn't enjoy eating with them at all.Why? The biggest reason is the curve of the tines. It reminded me of feeding a baby where you keep tilting the spoon up to get everything in baby's mouth. Second reason, sharp edges. Not the 'kn' part of the Knork, but the tines themselves. They're not rounded on the edges, but each tine has four distinct sides and in spots are quite sharp. As are the tips of each tine, even though the points are flattened.The handles overall are hefty and nice feeling, but the fork end feels too thin, partly because of the sharp tine edges. Not flexible. Just thin.And lastly I was expecting dark or black colored pieces. They're plain brushed stainless color. This would not have been a big deal if they were nice to use. Just unexpected considering how they look in the picture.Before purchasing try taking an old fork and bending the tines upward and try eating with them. I felt like I was scraping my upper teeth or the roof of my mouth. Especially with the sharp tines. In fact, the only place the tines aren't sharp are the spot you'd use to cut your food.A disappointing purchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKW4NC0FVQP3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00032SB2O#wasThisHelpful","RKW4NC0FVQP3C","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was intrigued by the concept when I first saw these. So when they became available in a Lightning Deal, I decided to give them a try. Here are my first impressions.Since these are the Pro version I expected superior sound quality. I think I would consider the sound quality in line with their cost. Certainly not what you'd get from a $100+ set of buds, but clean sounding with no disturbing characteristics.I can't yet comment on reliability, but am very concerned by other reviews and obvious design deficiencies. Although the zipper design may help keeping tangles at bay, it is more of a gimmick than a truly novel design. At one end of the zipper there are relatively thin and fragile feeling cables going to the buds. And at the other end an equally slender cable going to the plug. With the connection points from plug to cable, cable to zipper, zipper to cables, and cables to buds, you have multiple points of potential failure. With the number of reviewers reporting failures, this is not confidence inspiring.I can see why the later design 'slide' instead of a zipper might be preferable, and put less strain on the transition points.Although not what I expected (I feel like I have to treat these gingerly so they don't fail), they're certainly a decent set of earbuds. Probably at a slight premium for the zipper, which will help deter tangles, but not eliminate them.I'll add another star if they continue to function over time. If they don't, I'll take two more off my rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GXIELW0SDUP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E952W3A#wasThisHelpful","R2GXIELW0SDUP7","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Worked fine for awhile. Used as a repeater for a FIOS router/modem to cover my house. Then I noticed I could only connect on the 5g side. On the 2g side I connected to the FIOS router directly with a poor signal.

"If for no other reason, I love this cookware because it's PTFE free. I have parrots, and exposing them even for a few seconds to an overheated Teflon pan can kill them.

It's durable enough to withstand metal utensils if you're not too rough.

"After ordering Horst dress shirts, I had high hopes for these. I have long arms, and these are one of few manufacturers that provide sleeves that are long enough not to have to wear rolled up. But I was concerned that 'slim fit' might be a little snug around my expanding belly. Very nicely made, with tastefull patterns. Although the two I got seemed to be different fabric. One was very light. The other slightly heavier with more texture to it.So, why only three stars? And why are they going back, even if the waist was adequate? It's the chest that killed it. Unless you've got a sunken chest (no pun intended), or can breathe without inhaling, these will present a problem. The shoulders are wide enough, but when I breathe in or stand up straight with my shoulders back, the only thing holding the shirt closed are the straining buttons. Even in the picture, it looks like the model is pressing his shoulders forward and together to avert this unacceptable fit.If you chest is smaller than your waist, and you have long arms, then by all means consider these great shirts. Otherwise you may be wasting your time thinking that I must be exaggerating about the fit. I'm not. I don't have a wide chest, and look more like a bicycle rider than a weightlifter (for obvious reasons).","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TJPST4MPAAR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXVAHTE#wasThisHelpful","R3TJPST4MPAAR5","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been looking at folding bikes to use with my RV without having to use a bike rack on the back. One of my main considerations was seat height, as I have long legs. All the specs for these things seem to focus on the height of the rider; totally worthless information. And they all are overly generous. This model says riders up to 6'4"". I'm only 6'1"" and this bike just fits. My inseam is 35"", which should give you a better idea of if it will fit you.Another consideration is folded size. If you look at a comparison chart, you'll see the Downtown and Urban models are quite similar. One difference is the Downtown does not have folding pedals. So it will be a couple of inches thicker when folded. You can, however, remove the right pedal easily (the left one doesn't matter, as it doesn't stick out) with a wrench. Other differences are wheel size. The Downtown uses a standard 20"" wheel. Listed weight is almost identical.Gearing should also be a consideration, since you only have one gear. I was concerned that it would be geared too low to make pedaling easier, but speeds slower. Happily, it wasn't, and is a good compromise. Moves right along on flat ground!So, I bought the Downtown as it was also quite a bit cheaper than the Urban.I also own a Dahon Vybe. Although a 7 speed bike, similar in many respects to the Allen, so I put them side by side to compare them. Here are a few thoughts.Materials. Both use quality materials and weigh in the mid twenty pound range. With a folder, carbon fiber components, or trying to shave a few ounces, is silly. Welds on the Dahon seem a little cleaner, but not much. I found in ridin the bikes, the handlebars flexed a little more on the Allen. Not enough to concern me.Components. Brakes, levers, cranks, rims are high quality on both bikes. Mostly alloy. Nothing cheap looking. Hardware to fold and open the bike is high quality, with safety mechanisms to keep them locked in place in use. Both have nice seats, but the Allen has a more modern design, making it more comfortable.Both bikes have kickstands, and reflectors on wheels, seat, and handlebars. The Allen has a nice little bell.Pricing. I do not pay full price for anything. The MSRP of the Dahon is more realistic. The Allen has a higher price, but on sale, a bigger discount. I bought the Allen from Amazon. It came well packed with the paint protected. All that was needed was attaching the right pedal (wrench not included so I just finger tightened, but I would not recommend that). The tires needed air before the bike could be ridden. I did notice the tires are directional, so the front wheel on the Downtown is on backwards. Hopefully I can just turn the wheel around. I bought the Dahon at a retail store, so it was assembled and ready to ride. I paid $245 and $320, plus tax, respectively for the bikes. The Allen Downtown retails for up to $200 more than I paid. The Urban, which is nearly the same, is even more. The Vybe C7 has been discontinued, and current models are about $100-200 more for the same quality level.Other bikes are considerably more expensive. Brampton for example is about $1,200. Retrospec, and other models can be somewhat less expensive. I think the $400-$500 price point gets you an excellent bicycle with few or no sacrifices in quality. I expect my two machines to provide me with reliable service for several years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QZUDB0OT1P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVP77G8#wasThisHelpful","R36QZUDB0OT1P4","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My patio set arrived this morning. A 220 lb. pallet of stuff.It appears to be pretty much what I expected with a few minor issues and one disappointment.The fabric on the cushions is synthetic and feels like it belongs on outdoor furniture, but not at all plasticky feeling. All the cushions have zippered covers, so can be removed for replacement or more extensive cleaning. The 'wicker' is plastic, which I actually prefer so it will hold up better. It, too, does not seem at all plasticky.Comfort is also about what I expected. Not bad at all.Now for the disappointment, for which I only subtracted one star, and I'm unsure how Amazon or the manufacturer will handle it. One of the armless chairs doesn't line up. Not a big deal sitting in it, but it just looks wrong. One of the boxes was crushed some, but I don't think that's what caused it. It appears to be from lack of quality control. (See pictures for the problem).And although delivery is usually not part of a product review, it is definitely part of this purchase. When ordering you are given a choice of delivery times within a few hour window. The pieces come on a single pallet in 5 or 6 boxes. So each box is easy to carry to its final location.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPQF2VAW1D952/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TM10I2#wasThisHelpful","RPQF2VAW1D952","A3QNX5KWHDV0GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QNX5KWHDV0GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And why would I write one for a product I don't even own.Because I almost bought one without having read a significant warning. And that is, THIS MACHINE WONT BREW REGULAR KEURIG CUPS!I have a Keurig machine that I bought after all the rave reviews. I don't drink black coffee, and after adding milk it was often barely warm enough. Max brewing temp is 192 degrees, and I would sacrifice a bit of flavor in exchange for higher temps. And the cups aren't cheap. If you brew a larger size drink, it is not strong enough.Bear in mind, I am the guy who will never pay Starbucks for a cup of coffee.But back to the Rivo. After the REQUIRED UNIQUE CUPS, I read too many believeable reviews of product failure and plastic taste.Then, price is an issue. Remember, no Starbucks guy who doesn't like to pay more than 50 cents for a small cup of coffee. But a deal came up to buy a unit from Keurig for under $68.

It is his sleeping spot during winter & summer. He is in that bed all the time. It fits perfectly & he is about 12 lbs, but rather small. The bed itself has held up great in the washing machine & dryer. I wash it out every couple of months to get rid of all the cat hair on it. The colors have faded some, but the overall softness of the plush material is still there. The bottom, top & sides are cushioned but the bottom is not. There is a soft cushion pad that goes inside though. I haven't used the house open with my cats because they don't like going into it.

Within a few minutes his nose unclogs & I can hear him breathing easier, the coughing will stop & no more sneezing.

This worked so well in killing roaches that every year I'd buy another pack to use. by 2014 the house was pretty much roach free & has stayed that way ever since.Now that there are no roaches to be seen, I assume they are either all dead of hiding from me, there have been spiders, a 'child of the earth' (if you don't know what it is, google it... i thought roaches made my skin crawl till one of these crawled on me.... ), scorpions & an occasional army of ants. We don't live in AZ & the scorpions here aren't aggressive or poisonous, so those tenants I try not to evict. Some spiders I don't have issues with either, except for the poisonous kinds like widows. In such cases I will double up the strength of Demon for a special once over the house in all hopes of either scaring every living arachnid out of this house, or killing what fearless ones that stay behind.So far I've found a dead 'child of the earth' (which means there must be more, thankfully I haven't seen them), scorpions & yes, spiders. Mostly all these bugs hide out in the garage where it is mainly dark, quiet & lots of hiding places. I pay extra attention to the dark crevices when I spray.Earlier this morning my 2 cats were playing with a widow. Yes, my heart stopped for a minute there when I realized my cat was 'mouthing' a live widow! Poor spider probably didn't sign up for a cat spit bath this morning, but I am thankful that my cats caught it before my one year old son was able to pick it up thinking it was something to play with. From the research I've done, widow bites can be quite dangerous to pets, young children & older adults causing trouble breathing, high blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhea & severe pain, etc.I'm guessing that since I went around the house putting drops of peppermint (said to ward off spiders) oil it must have drawn the spider out of its hiding place. No telling if the spider was offended by the smell or was attracted to the possibility of a candy cane free for all buffet. Either way, once again I pulled out the Demon WP to give the house a good once over so I can rest easy tonight knowing that no more spiders will face impending doom via a cat spit bath, then probably inevitably being eaten.Now, from what I have read about Demon WP it is considered safe once dry, although it does leave a white residue behind. Its good to open up windows while you spray because it stinks (not the 'if i spray some room spray it will go away smell"", its more the 'oh what is that awful smell"" stink). Like I mentioned above, I buy a pack of this once a year to spray in Spring when the bugs start coming out & always have a little left over to retouch up in Fall when the cooler weather seems to bring out the scorpions & spiders. I do keep the cats/baby out of the rooms I spray until it is completely dry. I'm not certain this is water proof, but after mopping it seems to keep working.I have used this outside too to spray inside the water meter (more for me than the water man, for those occasions i have to clean the dial), around the yard for fleas, flies and ants. Immediately after spraying the bugs start to die off with contact, especially an entire ant colony within 20 minutes after spraying directly into the hole & around.In all the years that i have been spraying bugs around the house (I have arachnophobia) Demon WP is the strongest I've found to kill even scorpions. So far it isn't one of those poisons you spray & 3 months later it stops working. In my house this has worked on it's own for a whole year.I've attached a picture of what the envelope looks like, there are 3 small packs of powder inside each one. I also attached a picture of the poor chewed up widow (the details in the pic are terrible. this widow had 2 white circles on the top & 3 red dots on the belly)On a side note I want to mention that I don't have an overly large house yet 3 packs of powder will last me a year considering I double the packs to spray one time, then go back again in Fall with a single pack to spray again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17BJXM507M14P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035AM6NG#wasThisHelpful","R17BJXM507M14P","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"we've had this mattress for 5 months now. it fits perfectly into my sons Graco Pack n Play, that we use as a crib for him. the mattress is water proof, so on those nights where his diaper doesn't hold up well the mattress is easily cleaned. the springs feel a little hard to the touch but that is what our pediatrician recommended for my son, that he have a hard mattress to sleep on. i've since added a thin foam topper to this because my son doesn't like sleeping on hard surfaces (he's a year old now & sleeps in his crib next to me). he sleeps through the night well and spends an hour or 2 during the day playing in his crib with toys sitting, laying down, jumping up and down. its held up well for him and i can imagine he will be sleeping on this mattress for quite a while longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UPPFY2UKZ0SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006Z2BZAQ#wasThisHelpful","R1UPPFY2UKZ0SH","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The scratch pad has held up pretty well considering how much my cats love scratching on pads like this one. I've had the toy for about a year now & am so glad I bought it.

"A while back the vet recommended using this for my cat because he was coughing up hairballs. The vet said it would also help his digestion, to move things along easier. I've been using it on & off with 3 cats. One cat likes the taste, the other 2 won't go near it. I put a small dime size drop on their paw before they run off acting like I touched them with something appalling. So far no hairballs, but as the vet said this does keep things going easier- the evidence is in the cat boxes. I'm not a big fan of petroleum, especially wanting my cats to ingest it but if the vet says it's safe, then I have gone on a trial & error run. My cats are healthy, I don't use this every day-more so as a as needed basis. It seems to work, so it's a keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R45TAKBW1ZWEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RHN3GK#wasThisHelpful","R45TAKBW1ZWEI","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my son because he is teething. He's 11 months old & some days he's inconsolable no matter what I do. I use this with Hylands natural teething gel, but use the gel more often than I reach for the Infants Advil. I'm very careful about what I give my son & have used Advil for many years myself for pain so I figured it would be good for my son too.He doesn't seem to like the flavor too much because he makes a funny face when I give it to him. I squirt a little at a time into the cheek part of his mouth until he had the recommended dose, plus it gives him a chance to swallow what's already in his mouth without choking on it or without it going down his throat causing him to choke.It seems to help because he rests better if I give it to him at bedtime, or is more content during the day if I give him a dose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WKEF20391JI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004T174DM#wasThisHelpful","R30WKEF20391JI","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bough this for my 11 month old when he started teething. It is all natural, so I don't feel bad about putting it on his little gums & worrying it will burn or cause some reaction from chemicals. I don't want to stick my finger in his mouth all the time so I put a couple drops of gel around the nipple of his bottle/on the straw or spout of his sippy cup before each feeding. I also leave this in the fridge so it is cool when it goes on his gums. It seems to be helping compared to not putting it on his bottle at all. On real bad days where he won't stop crying for anything & his gums are visibly red/swollen I will rub this on his gums after giving him some Infants Advil. I'd rather just use this gel than anything else though & since using it my son has been much happier during feedings of solids after having this on his gums. I haven't noticed any irritation from using it & since the company has been around for long as I can remember I trust the brand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQAPW29P6HIJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00719E0MM#wasThisHelpful","RQAPW29P6HIJR","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 11 month old has terrible eczema & most any scented lotion or wash I use on him will cause a rash. I started using Cetaphil when he was 4 months old because the rashes were so bad in some spots of his body they would crack/bleed. This hasn't stopped all the rashes, but it sure doesn't cause irritation or more rashes than what he normally has. This wash is so gentle that I can use it on his hair too. There is a mild scent to this wash which I think is nice, compared to the Cetaphil bar which has no scent at all. I like that this wash will lather up the way regular soaps do as well. It rinses clean away & leaves no residue behind. I'd recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSOESIJL1899C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKJGP74#wasThisHelpful","RSOESIJL1899C","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this scale for about 12 years now. At first I had it programmed with my height/age to tell body fat, etc- but now just use it as a simple scale to tell my weight. I started out with a spring scale but had such a hard time bending over (with a bad back) to reset it before every use, so one day out shopping I came across this one at the store. It is easy enough to program, very simple to turn it on with one toe-no more bending over.My weight seems to be 3 lbs less on this scale compared to the the one at the doctors office. I'm going to just say that for me, 3 lbs difference is accurate enough considering that I am fully clothed wearing shoes at the doctor office when I get weighed in.In the 12 years of having this scale I have changed the batteries one time when it stopped working & I thought for sure it needed to be replaced. I don't weigh every day. more like every week or so. During my pregnancy I was on this scale every week & comparing it to the Dr. office (also every week), yet again it came out with the 3 lbs difference (my scale is old faithful at this point).I'm satisfied with the scale. It is easy enough to use, the digits can be read without much trouble (compared to squinting at a spring scale dial).If ever old faithful goes out then I will order another from Amazon because I am certain the store I purchased the one I have now, no longer carries them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ECWIKUTQXGYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VW1MEW#wasThisHelpful","R2ECWIKUTQXGYA","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm in the process of transitioning my one year old off the bottle and into a sippy cup. He does not want anything to do with sippy cups. So, this sippy came with a spout & nipple (the nipple has bumps on it- I read it helps to get a toddler used to different textures in their mouths to help with eating solids). Well, since this comes with a spout I figured I'd try it on his bottle, so at least he'd be getting used to the feeling of not drinking from his regular nipple-which will help when I put the spout back on his sippy. It fit well on the Classic Avent plastic bottle without leaking & he didn't even notice a difference except that the spout didn't flow fast as the nipple he's used to. Hopefully this will help him to get used to a different feeling than the nipple he's used to, so that when i do switch to the sippy (just a different color & look from his bottle) he will be familiar with how the spout feels and accept the sippy. Of course this might not work, but it's worth a try!I also wanted this sippy because it is easier to clean than the straw one and the cap stays tight on so when my son throws it to the ground at least the spout won't get dirty. The handles don't come off like some cups that have removable handles, but that's alright. The handles are soft to grip and I am guessing this cup is 8 oz? I'm not sure yet because I haven't had a chance to fill it up. The times I've given it to my son he just pushed it away or threw it. We are still in the learning to play & accept his sippy stages. I'm confident this sippy will be a good replacement for his Avent bottle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHFPJPYEDPEXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FE8C4G6#wasThisHelpful","RHFPJPYEDPEXB","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is about the only case I have found to go on a Moto E 1st gen phone. It is a firm rubber that feels pretty secure on the phone. I'm going to say that it will be hard to remove from the phone as well. It's not a hard plastic case. There are grooves on the side to keep the phone from slipping out of your hands, which is a nice feature. It isn't bulky at all. I like the cut out in the back that shows the Motorola logo.

"I'm not entirely new to essential oils, but this one was a first for me. I wanted Lavender because of how well it works to calm & relax, also for making 'dream pillows' by spraying a diluted amount onto the bedding at night. This oil is very strong & only needs a couple of drops for most anything you're planning to do with it. The bottle should last quite a long time. I've made bath salts, sugar scrubs, 'dream pillow's, used it to refresh furniture, window covers, rugs & also made homemade shower gel with this. A little goes a very, very long way. The scent is pleasant when diluted.The only problem is that I can't have it around my son because even diluted the scent is too strong for him & he will cough until he's no longer around it. I did read though that this oil is safe when diluted to use on & around babies (6 mo & older), but do your own research before taking my word for it. My son is 11 months old & I haven't used any essential oils on him, nor in his bath so I can't say how safe this is for babies.What i can say is that diluted in a bottle of water it makes a great room freshener when spritzed around the house.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32J9BQJ5KEGG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQOERJE#wasThisHelpful","R32J9BQJ5KEGG8","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all I want to make it clear that I am not one of those people who got this phone in exchange for a 'honest' review.I bought this phone because I am a 'light' phone user & want to spend as little every month towards phone service that is possible. This brought me to Tracfone. $10 a month cards with triple minutes, plus carry over that stays active for 6 months at a time if you use the phone at least once in that time period. But then Tracfone got even better with android phones that are wifi capable (install text/calling apps to use on wifi without using up  your phones minutes). See where I'm going with this?My requirements for an android phone are to at least have a 4.5 inch gorilla glass screen, decent camera that is front/back facing with a flash, run nothing less than android 4.4, be on the Verizon network (a deal breaker. I refuse to use a phone on Sprint towers due to terrible signal & blackout days), no SIM card at all (too much hassle to activate).This phone might not be running android 6.0, nor be an iPhone, doesn't have the latest technology but it works for what I want it to do & is what I was looking for in an android phone.Activation is easy as well. Go online to Tracfone's website, click on activation & enter in the required information, on the phone itself click on what ever window pops up to complete activation, make that one last phone call & hear the recorded message that your phone has been successfully activated. Simple.Now it might be a hassle to some people to use 2 separate phone numbers (a text/calling app phone number-plus your given Tracfone number) on one phone but if you really think about how much money you are saving each month/year by switching to Tracfone & using wifi for the heavier calling/texting/data (for free) it really isn't a hassle anymore.

"This is my first purchase of peppermint oil. I initially have peppermint tea bags for upset stomach/IBS symptoms that work well but wanted something a little stronger to try in hopes that it will calm my IBS. My doctor recommended that I try a 'high grade' peppermint oil daily in a glass of water (just a couple drops of peppermint oil). It took me a while to research the different brands to find one that actually is safe to ingest. During my research i learned that peppermint oil is also good to ward off spiders, clean the house, disinfect & great for tooth problems (a couple drops in toothpaste), also helps to stimulate hair re-growth (a couple drops in a carrier oil, or in shampoo).I want to make it clear that I am not one of those people who got this free in return for a 'honest' review.I'm pretty new to peppermint oils & this one smells just like a candy cane. I put 3 drops mixed in with coconut/grapeseed oil to massage into my hair/scalp for an overnight treatment & smell like a candy cane now. I can feel the oil tingling on my scalp too.The smell is pleasant & nice. I like that there is a dropper or a cap you can use. The packaging was also very secure.I've also added some onto the vaporizer for a nice minty scent in the room. I plan to also use a couple drops on toothpaste, to try and clean with it. Earlier I had some peppermint tea with a couple drops of this & it tasted nice. Cleared my sinuses pretty well too.I really like the smell of this oil & will buy again.

Either way, it is installed in the panel. the incessant beeping from a low battery stopped so for the time being i am happy at least to not hear that beep every few seconds. i wouldn't order this battery again. next time i plan to go directly to the alarm company to purchase a new battery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MA44GANVIRP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00117ZCTA#wasThisHelpful","R2MA44GANVIRP0","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Initially i wanted a mop that would save me from having to pull out the bucket of water & wring a heavy mop every time i wanted clean floors. then i started thinking about my 10 month old son crawling around on the floors, plus seeing how dirty his socks were by the end of day. that is how i came to the decision of trying out a steam mop & after reading the good reviews on this one figured it was worth a try.i couldn't be happier with my steam mop. it is easy to use, has the carpet attachment to 'touch up' carpets (or in my case area rugs), 2 washable pads & the cord is long enough that i don't have to plug into every room.we have unsealed wood floors that collect too much dirt no matter how often i mop, so at least this steam mop has made cleaning the floors easier. it produces a lot of hot steam quickly after turning the unit on & will clean 2 medium sized rooms on one full tank of water.it is very easy to use, doesn't weigh much & cleans without having to push down on it. i'd recommend to others looking for a steam mop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WX8CP3YLNQDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US9PSKU#wasThisHelpful","R1WX8CP3YLNQDM","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son is 8 months old & this is the only bottle I use for his feedings. I didn't want plastic, so a glass bottle was ideal & looking for one was very hard until I found this one. We started out with this brand before he was born & once I saw how easy to handle the bottles are I opted for a glass one. These bottles are easy to grip & hold when you're feeding, also very easy to clean. There is some weight to this bottle & it is a thick glass, so i have to be careful when my son is crawling around & the bottle is out so that he doesn't bump himself in the head with it. i don't let him hold the bottle either, because again I am afraid he'd conk himself in the head accidentally with it.I haven't dropped this bottle yet so I can't say how well it would hold up against an accidental drop, but would imagine it could (not that i'd use a glass bottle that had been dropped on a hard surface, nor would I recommend it, because you can't always see tiny cracks!)Overall this is a great bottle & stays cold in the fridge, holds the cold in with an ice pack when we go out (it is summer right now)I'd recommend to anyone looking for a glass bottle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34GA14HG9X4JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083TTLG4#wasThisHelpful","R34GA14HG9X4JS","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not sure about this scent, because I have the eucalyptus one instead.About the product, I am so glad to have stumbled across it. Back in April 2015 my male non altered cat decided to spray the ENTIRE house, including beds, chairs, curtains, floors, walls. It was a horrible stinking mess. I ordered 4 bottles of a urine odor remover, which did nothing except bleed my wallet dry & cover up the stink. My cat kept spraying including the entire month after I had him neutered (he quit after that, except for the occasional puddle). We were about ready to re-home my cat because it was a lot of work shampooing carpets, mopping, laundering & wiping down walls each time he'd spray or pee somewhere.Finally after searching the internet for home remedies to rid the stink I came across several posts mentioning Odoban for removing cat pee stink. Luckily it is carried here locally so I could pick up a gallon right away & start using it.I mixed a gallon bottle as directed & filled up a spray bottle. The more concentrated you make the mixture, the stronger the scent (with the one I have it is overpowering if you make it too concentrated).Day 1 with Odoban. I cleaned the entire house. Did a sweep of walls, furniture, laundered with a half cup of diluted Odoban I made a mixture from, shampooed the carpets, mopped & sprayed down bathroom, kitchen & everything else I thought could use a cleaning. It was a lot of work, but once I was done the sinks shined, the hardwood floors looked clean, there was no more cat pee stink. (I do want to mention that when you apply to cat pee on fabric, the pee stink will come out until the Odoban dries & then it goes away).Day 2 with Odoban, the cat did not spray or pee anywhere.Days went on & no more puddles. I wish I'd found Odoban before spending all that money on urine stink remover that failed. It was the end of month 2 of him spraying, after he was neutered & thankfully the Odoban deterred him from marking the house further.Now I am still using Odoban daily to spray down counter tops, sinks, bathrooms, mop hardwood floors, clean the stove & even clean the litter boxes with. It removes odors wonderfully & the scent fades away after a couple hours. My cat still leaves puddles around the house every now & then when he's mad at me, but this time I have my Odoban to spray & clean up. Works every time.(My hardwood floors are unsealed & original flooring in a 70 year old house. I've had no problems mopping with Odoban one part diluted mixture, 3 parts water)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BHDLHAC8U6F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WU69SQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BHDLHAC8U6F7","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had a really restful nights sleep after taking 1 of these a half hour before bedtime.Then i figured it would be worth a try to see if it helps with my anxiety during the day, since I was suffering with a severe IBS-D flare up that left me having panic attacks every single time I'd have to use the bathroom (IBS suffers understand). I would literally start shaking & cry because I knew it would hurt & I was just so sick during the flare up.After a couple days of taking 1 during the day I noticed that my anxiety was less. I wasn't crying or having a panic attack every time I had to use the bathroom, which with an IBS flare up is OFTEN!A week went by & I started taking 2 pills a day. 1 in the morning & 1 again before bedtime. I noticed more restful sleep at night & less anxiety during my days.I figured it was just me thinking these pills work so I skipped 1. Wow. What a difference! Now I stick to taking 2 a day.The feeling I get from these is just a total calm, not groggy or anything else. Just more relaxed & not so easily stressed out. I don't have such horrible panic attacks & I'm able to go about my day.My husband has severe anxiety as well & he gets the chest tightness with palpitations. He's started taking 1 a day & has noticed the difference within 2 days of taking these. He feels calmer, sleeps better at night & his chest isn't as tight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTIXP7ED3256/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDUYM1Y#wasThisHelpful","RPTIXP7ED3256","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It works to find stains, even works on poop stains that are set in, washed out & still there. A cat of mine pooped on a rug that I washed several times & used this light on only to find the spot he pooped glow purple in color.We don't have carpets, so this will work on hard wood flooring & even on walls (paint drops will glow purple). I didn't get much use of it though, probably because my cat didn't mark his territory as much as I initially thought he did.

"Back in the end of March 2015 I had to put my baby Marble to sleep because he had a severe intestinal obstruction that went untreated due to a negligent vet misdiagnosing him. I had 4 special days with my baby before he became so sick there was no other option. It was extremely painful losing him & I wanted something to keep him close to my heart always. When i found this pendant while searching for an urn here on Amazon I knew it was exactly what would keep my baby Marble with me.Delivery was fast, it came in a day before his urn was ready to pick up at the vets office. I had no trouble at all placing a tiny amount of his cremains into the pendant & the tiny screw on top did not need glue to hold it in place.Ever since March 29, 2015 I have worn this pendant with absolutely no problems with the screw coming out or the pendant losing its beautiful shine. I have gotten one compliment from a lady who saw the pendant, without knowing what it is. She mentioned ""loving that cat pendant"". I love my pendant too, because every time I miss my baby Marble all I have to do is reach up & hold the kitty pendant in my hand. This is truly a beautiful urn pendant. The details of the cats whiskers, ears, legs & face are clearly seen. The back has a very small space that can be engraved by a jeweler, as I am wanting to have that done with Marble's name one day.I have added a photo of my pendant for anyone who is considering this for themselves. I would recommend this pendant to anyone who has lost a cat & I do send out my deepest sympathies to you. The pain of losing a fur baby is immeasurable. It is my philosophy that cats are angels that grace our lives with their love & companionship.There are 3 photos attached. One is the pendant in person. 2nd is the pendant on my baby's urn so you can see the size (my baby's urn is small about the size of a large box of matches. Finally is a photo of my baby Marble when he was well. To be able to keep my baby close to me at all times is such a wonderful feeling for me, so I am thankful to the company who makes these beautiful pendants.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X1SIMPK3WA4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GA990TM#wasThisHelpful","R1X1SIMPK3WA4B","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE *This is now bottle #3. My male unaltered cat has come to sexual maturity & decided to mark his territory all over the house. Nature's Miracle is the only thing I can find to remove the stink from his urine. I have laundered blankets, rugs, clothes with no problems using N.M.. My cats latest spot to pee is the bed... a nice big puddle right in the middle of the bed (memory foam mattress topper included). I used an almost empty bottle of Febreeze & mixed in equal parts water/N.M. into the bottle so it's easier to spray not only small areas but also large surfaces at once. I soaked the bed & within hours the stink faded to nothing. I've also had to use that spray bottle to soak a cloth material recliner that my cat sprayed (he's been a busy boy). We have a large wool area rug that covers the living area that he peed all over & with the spray bottle I was able to soak the rug enough to remove the stink.I've mopped our wood (not sealed) floors with N.M., wiped down counter tops, cleaned the litter box & even used it on the walls (especially by doors & windows where he sprayed). There were no issues on any of the surfaces I used it on (be sure to spot check before you do though)If you get to the puddle of urine while it is still damp, spray or saturate the fabric with N.M., as it dries the stink will go away & leave no stain. Of course you need to pull up as much urine as you can with paper towels or a dry towel before treating the spot.A word of the wise, plain old laundry soap does not remove the stink of cat spray (I found that out the hard way). Also, ammonia based cleaners will make the stink worse, even attract the cat back to where he originally peed or sprayed (cat urine is ammonia based).I'd recommend this to anyone who is dealing with cat urine smell. It also works in bathrooms for human urine too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XMCZ4D3OHIFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003I5QRJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2XMCZ4D3OHIFA","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My cats really do love this gel. I'm not sure how well it works for hairballs, but since it has no petroleum jelly I think it's worth trying. I have 2 DMH hair cats & a DSH. My DSH has hairballs that he's struggling to cough up, so I wanted to try this gel. It is a nice consistency, doesn't smell awful bad & my cats enjoy eating it so there's no mess in applying it to their fur.*UPDATE*April 12, 2015I wanted to write an update to say this stuff does work. One of my cats has been coughing, but not able to produce a hairball--but when he eats this stuff he doesn't cough as bad & a hairball actually came up! The other cat has been 'passing' hair, which I am at least glad it is coming out. My cats are happier & eat this stuff right out of the tube! It's a great way to get cats to groom each other too!*UPDATE*November 15, 2015Here is my updated review. So far I have 3 cats who I use this on. It's more of a touch & go, literally. I have to put a drop on the paw before my cat runs off acting like I touched him with something disgusting... The other cat does enjoy the Salmon flavor & I have no problems getting him to lick it right out of the tube. My cat still struggles with hairballs occasionally. I so much prefer this one over the petroleum version, simply because it seems more natural to me than petroleum. I do have the petroleum version as well, because the vet recommended it, although I am on the fence so to speak about using it as often as I would this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D3XHUTLRDW90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0021L8WOM#wasThisHelpful","R2D3XHUTLRDW90","AA1JJNJ5VYI97","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1JJNJ5VYI97?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For the first few days giving my son Gripe Water in his bottle or directly with the dropper he didn't show much discomfort during or after a feeding, but soon that all wore off. We do everything from burping every 2 ounces of a bottle, changing his formula, sitting him up during & after a feeding, so when we saw the reviews on Gripe water it looked promising to help him not scream/cry during feedings. His pediatrician has given my son a clean bill of health, so there's no other reason except Colic making him fussy with feedings.

"This GE Bluetooth Sm  art Switch is a very good timer but is only average for ""smart"" device.  Setup is very simple, you simply download the app to your smartphone, plug in the switch and then set it using the app.  It allows for basic programmability to control a lamp or small appliance so you can set it to turn on a light on a schedule or even using sunrise and sunset times for your area.  This device works great as a simple light timer the problem is that it is priced like a smart switch.  Since this device does not have wifi you cannot control it while you are away.  For example if you are at the airport and forgot to program this timer before leaving you are out of luck.  Other devices let you program and operate the device from anywhere you have access to wifi.  Of course this device is supposed to simplify the ability to set a timer for a lamp or small device but honestly why not just buy an ordinary timer for less than $10 bucks if all you want is the lamp to be on or off at preset times?  Perhaps if you purchase a few of these and create the ""bleutooth"" mesh network then this would provide more functionality.  As a standalone device, other products have a lot more features at a similar price point which make this product simply average for its price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OKNBAME6GN8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0134P957G#wasThisHelpful","R1OKNBAME6GN8E","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This hair removal system really does work to reduce the amount of body hair in the areas you treat.  What makes this system different than others I have tried is that it works for more skin tones and can also be used on some areas of the face.  The light does seem a bit stronger than the Remington iLight pro system I have used in the past so hopefully it will yield faster results. The one big downside to this setup is that it is significantly more costly.  Also worth noting is that a single cartridge replacement for this is $150 dollars whereas the iLight pro cartridge is only $20.  One of the other reviewers mentioned that this cartidge is good for over 100000 pulses witch is significantly more than the 1200 pulses that the Remington cartridge lasts for.

"This Epson PictureMate is a great photo printer that is easy to use and produces excellent quality photos.  There are other reviews of this printer that state that the ink packs are too costly and make this more expensive to use than similar products from Cannon or HP.  Amazon currently has the ink pack along with 100 sheets of photo paper retailing for $29.99.  The actual price is a bit lower than retail so that equates to prints that are 30 cents per photo or less.  This is about the same as most other dedicated photo printers.  Where the Epson really excels is in its photo quality.  The prints look far better than the competition especially when you consider how vibrant the colors are.Another positive point of this printer is that it is very portable and easy to use.  The screen and trays all fold and make this printer very easy to store.  There is no battery option with this printer so you will need a power source but for most people this will not be an issue.  This printer is great for producing high quality photos especially when you need instant photos and cannot get to a photo studio.  I find it very handy to make instant printouts to give to friends and family at get-togethers and events.The one big downside to this printer is that it has a pretty high initial price. Canon has a line of photo printers that cost less than $100.  Of course this Epson has much better photo quality than the Cannon but it costs nearly twice the price.  This would easily be a 5 star product if its initial price was lower or if its cost per photo was lower, but at its current price it is 3.5 - 4 Stars.*** Positive Points: ***- Excellent quality photos that cost 30 cents per photo or less- Easy Setup- Good Sized Color LCD which makes it easy to see the photos you want to print directly from an SD card- Everything folds away for easy storage*** Negative Points: ***- Even at 30 cents per photo this is a lot more costly to print at home than at major photo shops such as Costco or Walmart which charge 10 cents per photo- Print Speeds are rather slow taking about a minute per photo- Part of the setup requires you to print out some of the instructions.  This is very wasteful considering you are printing onto photo paper- Cannot print photos larger than 5 X 7- High initial purchase price","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YHQER33D50VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KU0RIA#wasThisHelpful","R1YHQER33D50VP","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially I got this as an alternative treatment for my kids when they have the cold and cough.  Unfortunately I read more about the ingredients specifically "" Bryonia"" and found an article on ""WebMd"" that stated it was unsafe at any dose.  This medicine has been used in homeopathic medicine for a while and is known for its laxative effect.  Other references online simply point to how it is used and don't mention any safety concerns.  As such I did not try this in my children and instead tried this only for myself.  It had a pleasant taste and did not seem to cause any dangerous side effects.

"I have a bathroom fixture that uses 6 candelbra bulbs.  Using 25 watt bulbs, that fixture was using a total of 150 watts.  I purchased this 10 pack of LED candle bulbs and so far they are working great.  The light output is nearly the same as the standard bulbs but I only use 18 watts.  The bulbs themselves are attractive and seem very well made.  Each came individually packaged and all worked flawlessly.  The light they give off is a warm yellowish tone which was very similar to the standard bulbs I was using which makes this a lot more natural to look at than some of the LED bulbs out there.  The best part is that these bulbs cost around $2.80 each when you buy the 10 pack.  My local hardware store sells a 3 pack of these for $12 (their sale price though normally they are $18)  I have purchased  a pack of those in the past and those tended to give more of a bluish light which was too harsh for bathroom use.

"Case Logic is known for making high quality camera cases that offer great protection and a variety of features.  I own about 5 different camera cases so when I got the chance to review this KDM-102 I thought it would be a great way to see how it stacks up to my current favorite the SLRC-202 (found at this link ... Case Logic SLRC-202 Medium SLR Camera Bag (Black)  ).  Even though both cases are listed as being medium sized cases this KDM 102 is definitely larger.  It can easily accomodate my Cannon T4i with an extra 55-300 and 18-55 lens.  It has a total of 4 pockets for holding additional items such as chargers, filters, and memory cards.  I wouldn't put a lens in the outside pocket because it is not padded but for non-delicate items they are very roomy.  Overall I still prefer my SLRC-202 case as it is slightly more compact and offers a bit more padding than this one.  If you have a larger camera or need more storage space then this case will definitely suite your needs.*** Positive Points: ***- Hammock system makes it easy to safely store your camera with the lens facing down so it is easy to access- Can easily accommodate 2 extra lens... I was able to put in my 55-300 lens with plenty of room to spare- Side storage pouches and front storage are very roomy though they are not padded- Bottom of the case is made of hard rubber so it will protect your camera from minor drops*** Negative Points: ***- Case is significantly larger than my current favorite the Case Logic SLRC 202- Camera and Lenses are stored in the same main compartment so if you have a larger camera you may need to take the camera out first before you can access your lens- The sides of the case are not as well padded as the SLRC 202Overall this is a great case if you dont mind its relatively large size.

"I bought this to replace a Frigidaire refrigerator filter.  The old filter had not been replaced for a couple of years and it was extremely disgusting and brown from all of the sediment it had removed from out tap water.  This filter was easily replaced the old one and the water taste was improved significantly.  Even the ice cubes had less of an aftertaste once this filter was installed.  The real beauty of this filter is that it costs less than 1/3 the price of the original Frigidaire Filter so I can finally afford to replace it more than every few years!

"I generally like the scent of most Calvin Klein fragrances so when I got the chance to try this Eternity Now deodorant it was a pleasant surprise.  The fragrance is very different from the classic Eternity scent, it almost has a lighter more modern aroma but still has that elegant undertone.  The Deodorant part of this spray is a bit on the weak side.  It will work for a few hours but don't expect this to take the place of a deodorant stick or true deodorant.  In my opinion this is more of a freshening  up deodorant that you can apply after a long day at work in preparation for a night or dinner out. It is similar to a lot of body sprays out there but it has a more refined (expensive) scent... of course it costs more too!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYYIVAUTM5B2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011M2WYUS#wasThisHelpful","RYYIVAUTM5B2U","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars - The Revlon Pro One Step Hair Dryer and Styler is an excellent product.  My wife has long (waist length) hair that she spends a considerable amount of time blow drying, brushing, and straightening.  This hair dryer allowed her to dry her hair in about half the time that she normally spends.  There was no need to hold a brush in one hand while drying with the other, the Revlon Hair Dryer allowed her to simply brush her hair and dry it in one step.  The Brush itself is very light weight... lighter than even her travel dryer,  which makes it easy to use.  The controls are simple twist controls on the bottom of the brush so it is easy to know what setting you are in.  The cord on the bottom is free to rotate so it does not entangle you as you move it across your hair.  The other benefit of this dryer is that it does have a mild straightening effect.  It won't replace a dedicated hair straightener but it will definitely cut down the frequency and time you spend straightening your hair. The one big downside to this product is its hefty price.  If it cost the same as most hair dryers it would be an easy 5 stars but since it is about double the price of a decent hair dryer I took off half a star.  Overall this is an excellent product though a little pricey.*** Positive Points: ***- Excellent design that truly saves time compared to an ordinary hair dryer- Lightweight and easy to maneuver- Easy to use controls- Cord rotates so it won't entangle you while you are drying your hair- Fast heat up time*** Negative Points: ***- High Price- No extras like a carrying case included-","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZVRHY3J318D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HJEA4C#wasThisHelpful","R1ZVRHY3J318D","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried all kinds of shaving products over the years.  I have no less than 5 electric razors, everything from Norelco, to Remington and even Braun.  All are decent products but none of them provide a shave that is even close to a regular blade.  This Panasonic razor is the best electric razor I have ever tried.  The instructions say that it takes up to 30 days for your skin to adjust for optimum performance but honestly on my first shave I could tell that this shaver was incredible.  I prepped my face like I normally do by washing with warm water the only difference was that I did not apply any shaving cream.  I was able to do my face on average in about 3-4 minutes.  The results were very good and even my wife was not able to tell that I had switched from my manual blade razor. The shave that this provides is extremely close and without spending a whole lot of time.The one big drawback to this Panasonic Shaver is its price.  It is a big initial investment at about $250 (current price on Amazon) but if you average this out over 2 years it is about $125 per year.  My current favorite manual razor is the Shick Quattro Power which works out to be about $150 per year (I use each blade about 1 week before I change it and an 8 pack of blades is about $20). Of course this does not take into consideration that the instructions on the Panasonic advise that you change the foil every year and you change the blades every 2 years (the cost is about $70 for the set).  The Panasonic does cost more to use but the difference is not huge when you average it out in the long run.  Overall the best shave is still with a manual razor but this Panasonic is simply the closest you can get without the fear of nicks or cuts.*** Positive Points: ***- Excellent Shave, the best shave I have ever had with an electric razor- Comes with Carrying case- Take less time to shave than a manual razor (average about 3-4 minutes for me)- Easy cleanup mode by simply holding down the power button- LCD display shows charge, elapsed time during shave, and when the blades need cleaning or changing*** Negative Points: ***- High Price (at least up front and also for the replacement parts)- Is actually only 2 blades though it has 5 foils on top- Instructions are not really very detailed for a product in the high end category- Instructions state that the foil should be replaced ever year and the blades every 2 years (the set costs $70)- Carrying case does not have room for power cord","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZ0SXY9EHMYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JWP8F3I#wasThisHelpful","R2FZ0SXY9EHMYV","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Large version  of this bath mat is very long.  It goes from my shower drain nearly to my shower door which is great for preventing slips  all along the tub.  The material is about the same quality as most good bath mats with big ridges to ""massage"" your feet. The one big downside is that the mat comes only in lighter shades which means it will likely stain over a few months.  I would have preferred some darker colors which do not show stains.  Other than that this is s great choice in bath mats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMJQK5JKZV34I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4QBDK0#wasThisHelpful","RMJQK5JKZV34I","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Panasonic headphones are a good deal for anyone looking for budget headphones.  The headphones are well built though made out of mostly plastic.  I personally don't like the feeling of having something fitting tightly into my ears but these do fit pretty well into the ear canal.  After a few minutes of listening they became a lot more comfortable and I actually forgot they were in my ears.  The microphone control has a button on it which can be used to play/pause your music which is a great addition especially at this price range.  The microphone itself provides decent call quality with very few people on the other end being able to tell I was on a handsfree mic.  The one big downside to these headphones was sound quality.  If you are not picky about your sound then you will find it to be satisfactory, but if you are an audiophile you will find the sound to be rather flat.  It is not bad considering the price and probably on par with most headphones in the $10 price range but again if you are picky about sound it may be worthwhile to spend a bit more to get a pair with better sound quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OJBNX3ZMXZAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4LGU32#wasThisHelpful","R2OJBNX3ZMXZAF","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hot Wheels Monster Jam Dragon buildup is a good toy with a few flaws.  It is a pretty simple setup that involves launching one of the included trucks up a ramp and avoiding the dragon from chomping down on you.  If you make it past the dragon's jaw and hit the dragon's tail you get a trophy.  It is simple but fun and will keep the intended age group of 4-10 year olds entertained.  For the $20 price range this is a good purchase.*** Positive Points: ***- Works with other Hot Wheels cars- Easy to assemble and put away in the box- Comes with 3 trucks that the kids love- Good quality and value for the $20 price point*** Negative Points: ***- Frustration Free Package does not excite the kids when they first see or open it since there are no pictures on it- The track is rather small and not compatible with other tracks- Only one launcher means kids will have to take turns instead of battle each other- Play is somewhat limited thought the kids enjoy playing with the trucks","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWTE0TI2F39MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD3N3NO#wasThisHelpful","RWTE0TI2F39MM","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Burberry Brit Sheer is simply amazing.  It is light but has a woody undertone.  Not too floral but not heavy either.  It has a very ""expensive"" aroma that works well for party wear a s well as business. The perfume itself is clear so it will not likely stain white clothes.

"This stuff is simply amazing.  I started having a roach problem a few months ago and over the last few weeks it seemed uncontrollable.  I had tried every product I could find at my local Home Depot but the Roaches kept coming back.  Finally I decided to try this Advion Roach Gel (based on the reviews) and I must say the results are impressive.  Basically you put this bait in the areas where you have seen roaches.  I put this on the old roach motels that I had lying around my kitchen area.  The roaches really love this food and they will consume it.  Within a few days you will see the dead or dying roaches all over your kitchen.  Of course you will need to retreat the area after a few weeks just to make sure that they are all gone.  Also you want to make sure that small children are bot able to pick up or go near the food since it has a creamy white color that may attract them.  The price seems a bit high but in the long run it is worth it because the cheaper treatments really do not compare to this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SS2IJW9NIP8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067N7CXC#wasThisHelpful","R3SS2IJW9NIP8H","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this on a gas stove that had the pain peeling off the control panel. I first prepped the surface of the stove by removing oil with a degreasing spray (Easy Off Oven Cleaner worked well).  After that I sanded the area with a fine sandpaper and removed the loose paint.  I sprayed this on from about 6 inches away and got very good results.  I had to make about 2-3 passes but the final result was a nice glossy finish that matched the original finish on my stove.

"I have used a few fitness trackers over the last year and most have been cumbersome and not really useful. When I got a chance to evaluate this Jawbone UP2 I thought it would be another pedometer or heart rate monitor but this proved to be very different.  The UP2 is truly a lifestyle changing device.  It is very comfortable to wear (almost to the point that you will forget you have it on) and its one week battery life makes this very convenient to just wear and forget.  The App that goes with the UP2 is among the best that I have seen.  It not only tracks your activity level (like most of these devices do) but it also tracks your sleep patterns and allows you to input the food that you eat so it gives you an idea of your calorie consumption.  It not only tracks all of these things but it gives you tips every day with online articles that you can reference.  This thing doesn't just track your activity it actually educates and gives you real feedback!Some of the other cool features of the UP2 is that it vibrates to give you alerts.  For example you can set an alarm in the App so it can either wake you up in the morning or tell you when it is time to go to bed.  The band can also be set to vibrate if you have been inactive for prolonged periods of time (such as sitting at your desk at work).  The whole thing is very discrete and elegant.The only reason why I did not give this a 5 star rating is that the initial setup was a bit tricky for me.  The Jawbone did not pair with my Galaxy Note 4 until about the 3rd or 4th try.  To make matters worse, there is only a small quick start guide included in the package so it is very hard to know what to do if something goes wrong in the paring process.  I had to go the Jawbone website to learn how to get the Jawbone into the manual pairing mode.and after this it worked well.  Also the APP (while very useful) requires a bit of practice to fully understand all of the features.  It is easy to use once you have played with but the learning curve is still present.  Overall this is an excellent purchase for anyone looking to improve their fitness.*** Positive Points: ***- Very nice design that looks good on men and women- Comfortable to wear 24/7, you actually forget you are wearing it- Sturdy and water resistant with great battery life (I get about 5 days)- App for Android is simply amazing, it tracks food, sleep, and activity levels and is very easy to use and has some great tips to get you in shape- Band vibrates to give you reminders or alerts such as if you have been sitting too long or if you set a bedtime alert- Sleep tracking function is very nice to help you analyze how your sleep affects your daily performance*** Negative Points: ***- No real instructions in the box, just a quick setup guide- pairing was a bit finicky with my Galaxy Note 4, it did work but it took a few tries (also the lack of included instructions forced me to go on the web to read the FAQ on Jawbone's site)- Charger is innovative (with its magnetic hold) but very short so you will need to charge it on a counter or computer; also the included charger is USB only and does not come with a wall adapter","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114QACZ4T9Q68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIFFW#wasThisHelpful","R114QACZ4T9Q68","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used these to store blended fruits in the freezer to prevent them from rotting. I later use these for smoothies.  The first thing you notice about the bags is that they are very thick and seem durable enough to last a long time.  We used to use small plastic boxes in the freezer but those would break if dropped.  These bags are strong enough to be thrown around with frozen goods inside and not puncture or rip.  These are an excellent way to store things while saving money in the long run.  The one big downside is that these are costly.  At Nearly $5 a bag these cost as much as 1 box of a 100 zip lock bags of a similar size.  If I used 1 bag per day it would take me 3 months to equal the cost of this bag.  If you use a lot this will pay for itself very quickly but if you rarely freeze and use items these probably wont be worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WL5E394T4SRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9HL97O#wasThisHelpful","R1WL5E394T4SRA","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 Stars - To be honest I am not a big fan of ""organic"" anything.  The claims are often exaggerated and the benefits are not pronounced.  That being said, when I was given the chance to try this Campbells Organic Tomato soup I thought it would be a good way to judge if the ""Organic Soup"" tasted better than the plain tomato soup.  My Personal favorite boxed soup is from Costco which has a rich and creamy taste.  I expected this to be similar but to be honest it tasted much more plain.  The salt is there, the tomato flavor is there, the cream and basil is also there but this soup somehow lacks a strong flavor.  Not sure what it is but something is just quite lacking in its flavor.  Some plus points about this soup are that it is all natural and organic (if that makes a difference to you) and it is vegetarian (meaning no meat broths).  The price is very reasonable but considering you can get a slightly more flavorfull  soup for about the same price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V9GS2FZEFY5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5WYVCG#wasThisHelpful","R2V9GS2FZEFY5E","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basically this is a small sized 100 page spiral notebook with a cloth cover.  The cover to this spiral notebook is very nice and durable.  The overall size is also nice and compact which makes it easy to carry so you can jot down quick notes to yourself.  The built in pen loop is nice and makes it easy to always be ready to jot down notes and the divider inside is a great addition.  The problem with this notebook is that it is rather wasteful and pricey.  After your 100 pages are done you are forced to buy another notebook for the nearly $5 price tag.  I have bought spiral bound 100 page botebooks for less than 25 cents each so the $5 price is somewhat obscene.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HRLNXT9PVGEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7NT1QQ#wasThisHelpful","R3HRLNXT9PVGEM","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first thing to think about these labels is do you really need them.  They are expensive... nearly $4 each so there should be a very clear need before making the investment.  The quality of the labels is actually very good.  They are easy to print on but a bit tricky to actually get them to ""laminate"" perfectly. The other thing to keep in mind is that the top side of the label is laminate but the back side is not and is adhesive to allow you to stick it onto an object.  These are meant to be labels that you stick onto something which is important to keep in mind.  Overall these are very good for a limited set of purposes.  I used them to print a label key for my fuse box.  It looks great and I know it will hold up over the years.

"I have used a variety of inkjet printers over the years, and many have promised to provide reasonable ink costs.  While some models were cheaper to print with than others, they were still much more expensive than laser printers.  This Epson Workforce changes the whole Printer/Ink business model and gives you a relatively high priced printer with extremely low cost ink that lasts as long as a laser toner cartridge but at a much cheaper cost.Personally I think this is a great model for most users since if you print a lot you will easily cover its high price within in a matter of a year or two.  For example, I also have an Epson Workforce 810 which costs me $180 to purchase but costs over $60 dollars to replace all the ink cartridges.  That printer only prints about 400-500 pages before it needs more ink so it would take me 10 cartridge refills (at $60 a set) to reach 4000 pages of printouts that this Epson Workforce printer provides.  I would have spent over $600 in ink alone! just to equal the output of this printer.  What is even better is that the replacement ink for this Epson Printer costs about $13 per bottle (at current Amazon Prices) x 4 colors which is roughly $50 to print another 4000-6000 pages. This makes it even cheaper than most laser Toner Cartridges which cost between $75-$100 and cannot print in color.  If you print a lot this printer will definitely save you money in the long run.Apart from cost, This printer offers very good quality printouts in black and white as well as color.  I also tried a few photo printouts and this did a great job of producing low cost photos. They are not as bright and high quality as a dedicated photo printer and I am not sure how the pictures will hold up over the years but they look great at least in the short term.The major downside to this printer is that it does not offer basic features that should be standard at this price point.  For example the screen is relatively small and low resolution.  The paper tray has a low capacity and sometimes misses the alignment of pages.  The biggest blow is that there is no auto-duplexing (2 sided print) and there are no SD/USB slots.  Despite these shortcomings, this is a very good printer that will save you a lot of money if you print more than a few hundred pages a year.*** Positive Points: ***- Very Low ink costs- Decent quality printouts- Can print decent photos at a very low cost making this cheaper than even Costco or Walmart for printing photos- Relatively small size that can fit on most desks (just beware of the back side paper tray and side mount for the inks)- Relatively easy setup even for the wifi though the ink tank refill process was long*** Negative Points: ***- EXPENSIVE (basically you are paying more for the printer to make up for cheaper inks)- Slower than laser printers that are in this price range; Also slower than some high end inkjet printers- Does not have duplexing (though the more expensive model comes with this)- Paper tray is on the back/top  which will make this difficult to use in tight spaces- Ink refill process is a bit of a hassle though it will only be done once every 1-2 years.- LCD screen is extremely tiny considering the price of this printer","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SE2EG0GUKHMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JEHE#wasThisHelpful","R1SE2EG0GUKHMB","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have short wavy/curly hair that tends to frizz after I have applied shampoo and also when it is humid outside.  I tried this Suave cream and it worked pretty well to keep a decent hold on the areas that I styled while still controlling frizz on the other areas.  It is not too heavy like styling gel yet it offers a decent amount of hold.  The one big downside is that the instructions are  kind of vague and really only tell you about how to use this while creating a pony tail (not very helpful for a male with short hair).  Also worth noting is that the first 2 ingredients listed are water and alcohol. So this may end up stripping your hair of its natural oils.

These do not have any powder residue nor do they leave your hands feeling wet after use.  I was able to remove and re-use these about 3-4 times before they began to rip.  Other latex gloves I have used in the past only worked for 1-2 uses.  The tear was near the base of the glove so it did not interfere or allow the chemicals to come into contact with my skin.  The sizing was spot on for my large sized hands and it did not feel tight nor loose. Overall these are a great buy for Latex Gloves that will protect your skin at a reasonable price","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PUARUFMCOM0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BR57QU#wasThisHelpful","R3PUARUFMCOM0D","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my 10 year old son.  The fit was as expected and not bad.  The material used is very lightweight  and did not look like it would withstand much abuse.  On the positive side, the material was light and airy so it is good for summertime use. Overall this is a decent buy for a generic white polo shirt.

When I ordered this Axe White Label Style Refresher I thought it would be a great way to get some style back as the day wore on.  I tried it on a Saturday morning without having taken a shower and it really did not improve the look of my hair significantly. My hair did smell great but in terms of actual style this did nothing to improve the look.  I tried this a few more times in the evening after a long day at work and I had the same issue.

"I bought these Etekcity Programmable Rmote switches on a whim.  I have a pair of amplified speakers that are connected to a bluetooth audio input but every time I wanted to listen to music I had to turn on each individual speaker since their power switch was on the back of the speaker.  This Etekcity set helped me to simplify my setup.  It was very easy to program and I was able have 2 switches (one for each speaker) controlled by the same button on the remote. All I do is hit one button on the remote and both my speakers as well as my audio source turn on.  My room is fairly large and the speakers are in a semi hidden area yet the control always is able to turn on both speakers with just one press.  What make this remote setup even more handy is that you have 5 recievers that can be controlled individually (by different buttons on the remote) or by the same button.  Everything was easy to program and took less than a few minutes to setup.  I bought this for a slightly cheaper price but even at about $30 dollars this is well worth its price.*** Positive Points: ***- Comes with 5 switches, 2 remotes and even batteries for the remote- Can be set to control each receiver with a separate button or multiple receivers with the same button- Works even without a line of sight which means the remote can control the receiver even when it is hidden or out of site- Everything in the set was fairly good quality*** Negative Points: ***- Remote uses an odd sized battery (it is easy to find but not standard like AA or AAA sized batteries)- Would be even better if remote buttons were backlit","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HPSGSZE8DP1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQELHBS#wasThisHelpful","R2HPSGSZE8DP1I","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these to use in my range hood.  I previously had 50 watt halogen bulbs but wanted to try something that used less power.  These LE brand dimmable LED bulbs were an excellent replacement.  They were a perfect fit for my range and they work well with the 2 position dimmer.  The light that these give off was brighter than my halogen bulbs yet they only use 6.5 watts (about 1/8th the power consumption of the Halogen bulbs).  The best part is that the light that these bulbs give is a yellowish (not blue) light that is very similar to the original halogen bulbs.

"When my 5 year old daughter first laid eyes on this Learning Journey Play and Learn Shopping Cart she was extremely excited.  She immediately made me open the box and help her build the shopping cart.  The construction was fairly easy and the cart itself seemed very sturdy.  The only real downer was that the included ""food"" items were a little cheap looking.  Even the boxes seemed a bit flimsy although they were realistic.

"This Boss Double Plush High Back Executive Chair is a very comfortable and elegant  chair that looks like it is worth much more than its $150 price tag.  The assembly was fairly easy and took about 30 minutes. The instructions  were easy to follow diagrams and all the parts are labelled and even have tags indicating which side they go on.  The only confusing part was that the arms are attached with the included Allen Wrench while all the parts are attached with normal screws requiring a screwdriver.Once the chair was assembled , I immediately noticed that the leather has a nice soft touch feel very much like the interior of a luxury car. Once you sit on the cushion it feels comfortable and  plush with that exotic buttery softness that is characteristic of high quality furniture.  There were a few minor flaws in quality such as a scuff on the bottom piece that holds the wheels and a cheap plastic cover for the gas lift.  Other than these minor issues, this is a very comfortable and elegant looking chair that befits its $150 price.*** Positive Points: ***- Very Comfortable- Easy to assemble- Soft touch leather material- Good packaging that protects the chair*** Negative Points: ***- Some cheap parts such as the cover for the gas lift- Assembly is somewhat unusual in that the included Allen Wrench is only for the arms, the rest of the assembly requires a screwdriver- A few minor quality issues such as a scuffed base where the wheels attach","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CP1E6O0F32RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I3ZT9M#wasThisHelpful","R3CP1E6O0F32RJ","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing you notice about this stapler is that its small.  Compared to other staplers I have used that can handle up to 50 sheets this Rapid S50 is about half the size.  The next big difference is that this is a flat clinch stapler. What does this mean?  Well it staples by folding the ends of the metal together but without curving them inwards.  This leads to a flatter stack (the stapled part of the pages does not fold in).  The problem with this style of stapler is that it does not handle small projects very well.  If you try and staple 2 sheets together it will lead to the metal staples being easy to snag onto other things (even your fingers).  I tried this on a stack of 40 pages and it worked very well and it was easy to remove the staple when I got to work.  The price is a bit high but on par with other heavy duty staplers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17PHZ8DHPI12N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBZVMKK#wasThisHelpful","R17PHZ8DHPI12N","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to use on an HP Slatebook which is a 14- inch Android Laptop. This case basically is designed to protect your computer and allows you to use it without taking it out (almost like a shell). The laptop fits perfectly but I found that it sat too low and made it impossible to access the charging port or the USB ports.  Another issue was that it tended to block some of the vents on the bottom which made the laptop run hot.  I really liked the protection that this case offered so I wanted to see if I could make this case work out.  Eventually what I did was to put the case on in reverse so that the corner clips were near my keyboard and the elastic slots were on the screen.  This worked perfectly.  When I open the case the laptop rises about an inch which makes it easy to access all the ports.  It also raises the bottom of the computer up so the vents are no longer blocked.  The only downside to this is that the corners of the screen are slightly covered, not a major issue but sometimes annoying.  Also the case is a bit pricey considering it does not offer any pockets or other ""bells and whistles"" found in most other cases.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CL6UMXI8YP66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVZPTOU#wasThisHelpful","R1CL6UMXI8YP66","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a number of ""vinyl protectors"" over the years.  The classic stuff was always Armor All which left a nice slick glaze to let you know it was working.  Unfortunately that slick glaze was slippery to the point of being dangerous and it seemed to fade away after just a few weeks.  More recently I was given a chance to review this 303 Vinyl Protective Cleaner and it works incredibly well.  I sprayed this onto the door panels of my 5 year old Mazda and it immediately brought them back to life.  They went from looking like dull black plastic to having the rich almost leather-like appearance of when it was new.  I also tried some Armor All on one of the rear doors (just for comparison) and while it looked better than when it was untreated, it looked artificial and more like a shiny plastic then a rich leather.  Also worth noting is that 3 weeks after applying both products the 303 treated door panel still looks nice while the Armor all is starting to dull.  The only downside to this 303 vinyl protectant is that it costs about 50% more than other protectants I have purchased but the results make it worth it","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KEBI7L4KN652/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBHXC4E#wasThisHelpful","R2KEBI7L4KN652","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Motorola Dual Mode Baby Monitor is a decent baby monitor albeit at a high price. What sets this apart from other video baby monitors is that it comes with 2 cameras that can be used with the included screen (parent unit) and can also be viewed over wifi.  This is great for parents that want to watch over their kids while the babysitter or nanny is at home.  The cameras themselves have the ability to pan and tilt so they can be moved remotely to cover just about any sized room.  I have used this as a ""nanny cam"" as well as a security monitor to overlook my driveway and backyard to see when people come up to my house.  The video is clear and the ability to send notifications when motion is detected is very useful.to keep track of who is coming up while you are away.  The nightvision is about average, it definitely works but is not any better or worse than other video monitors that I have used in the past.  Also worth noting is that there are some delays in the audio and video but this is true with every video monitor.  Overall this is a great set although at a high price.*** Positive Points: ***- Can be viewed over wifi using the web portal- Parent unit can be used with the included battery pack or plugged in with the included adapter- Cameras can be moved (pan and tilt) remotely via the parent unit or via wifi- 2 way communication is possible via parent unit or via wifi (albeit with some audio delay)- Has the ability to send notification when movement is detected as well as take snapshots or video remotely- Video quality is very good over wifi, though the included parent unit has a screen with only average resolution*** Negative Points: ***- Price is high even for a dual camera setup- Parent unit has an average resolution display, the video is much better when viewed on a phone, tablet, or pc- There is some delay in the audio/video but this is true of all baby monitors/ webcams- Does not have a VOX (Voice activation) feature on parent unit so the video wont just turn on when the baby makes a sound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BBEFOYFCN4JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EM6PYM#wasThisHelpful","R3BBEFOYFCN4JM","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I can keep a fairly decent number of pages in its 6 pockets and they are easily accessible.  The top has a loop closure which works great at keeping the top closed.  The construction seems durable and should hopefully last.  The price is very reasonable with the downside being that the design, while modern looking, appears a too casual for business use.

"The Woods 6 Outlet Metal Surge protector is a good basic surge protector though it offers very few new or innovative features.  The sliding covers come in handy in dusty environments such as construction areas or where wood is being cut so you can prevent dust from entering into unused outlets. The metal construction is nice but does not seem to be any better or worse than other all plastic surge protectors that I have used.  The 3 foot cord is a bit on the short side and though the outlets themselves are nicely spaced, you are better off with a split (3+3) style surge protector if you have large adapters you need to plug in.  Furthermore, what makes this surge protector only average are the features that it lacks such as USB ports, power conservation outlets, or even a longer cord.

It is a lot easier to just drink a small glass of cranberry juice everyday than to have to take several of these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1RQZXXTKI0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4CT2BQ#wasThisHelpful","R2K1RQZXXTKI0H","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first received this table cloth it looked very attractive.  However, once I opened the packaging and spread this onto my dining table I began to notice that the material had several flaws.  They were not terrible but they were obvious.  This product sells for over $30 which is not exactly a bargain and is not cheap enough to ignore the flaws in the fabric  The color and the border are very nice, I only wish the construction and durability were on par with the design.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37IEMV0UJVBR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNVTCK2#wasThisHelpful","R37IEMV0UJVBR0","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rick Bayless Ceramic Baker is a high quality baking dish that can be used for a variety of food types.  The feature that stands out with this dish is the red exterior which looks great when setting out on a table after baking in the oven.  The dish appears to be well made with a built in lip on the sides which make it easy to grab.  Unfortunately there is no included lid and the oval shape limits the quantity of food being prepared.  Another negative is the relatively high price considering the size of this dish.*** Positive Points: ***- Heats evenly and does a good job of cooking- Easy to cleanup- Red color is attractive and looks great when serving*** Negative Points: ***- High Price- Does not come with a lid- Oval shape is not as efficient as a square or rectangular baking dish","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D2TXWOKAYUEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKKMSK#wasThisHelpful","R3D2TXWOKAYUEW","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Avery Tabbed Snap In Bookmark Plastic Dividers are, as the description says, tabbed snap in bookmarks.  A number of reviews here have given this a lower review because of this feature but it is very clearly stated that these are not ordinary dividers.  I found these to be very useful to quickly mark subject areas for later review.  The Dividers can be moved easily without opening the rings of your binder which is very handy in a classroom or library setting.

"My grandmother used to tell us how turmeric was important to take for to prevent infections and reduce inlfammation.  She also would make sure to cook with plenty of ginger because she said it was important for our health as we got older. Fast forward 20 years and I am now given the chance to evalute these Sundown Naturals Ayurvedic Balance Joint Health  which contain tumeric and ginger.  If you don't cook with these ingredients then this is a great way to supplement.  The pills are easy to swallow without the strong flavor of ginger or tumeric.  They are vegetarian safe and I found that the recommended dose is higher than what I need so for me 1 pill per day is enough.  Considering this has 90 pills it is a reasonable price but a bit on the high side.  Nonetheless these are a great way to naturally decrase inflammation and improve joint health.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC36PUNDCGNOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUHCJL4#wasThisHelpful","RC36PUNDCGNOX","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are simply looking for a WiFi camera this product is not for you.  You can buy much cheaper WiFi security cameras or baby monitors that will do similar WiFi video and audio  This Petcube WiFi camera is made specifically for pet owners that want a way to interact with their pets while away from home.  The 2 way audio is a pretty common feature these days but the Petcube takes it a notch further by allowing you to control a laser pointer from its smartphone app.  The Laser pointer moves and is sure to entertain your pet (at least for the first few uses)..  The broadcasting and ability to easily setup a live feed for others to watch is a very unique feature.  This makes it easy for other Petcube owners to easily view your camera feed (if you allow them to).  Overall the sharing and broaddcasting features make this a unique product that proud pet owners will love.*** Positive Points: ***- Easy Setup that simply requires you to download the app and connect to the Petcube.  After that just enter your WiFi network and password and the software does the rest- Good Quality video- Laser Pointer is nice novelty that is fun for the pets (and also kids)-  Easy to share videos with other Petcube owners.  Also makes it easy to set up your own content streaming- Good quality construction that seems durable and should hold up to occasional rough handling from your pets- Uses a common micro USB cable so in the event it gets lost it can be easily replaced*** Negative Points: ***- High Price especially when you consider equivalent webcams can be a fraction of this price.- Large size make it hard to place discretely for everyday use- It uses a lot of bandwidth so there may be some video or audio lag- The app should have options to set video quality (for those with slower connections)- Laser pointer can be controlled by others if you chose to broadcast your videos","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L10XKPWOZ9BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGWN8O8#wasThisHelpful","R2L10XKPWOZ9BQ","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot of people think that supplements and natural medicines are all phoney and the people who benefit from them simply go through the placebo effect.  This couldn't be father from the truth.  Pharmaceutical companies are  always looking to plants to try and give them the basis of their new ""miracle cures.""  Ayurveda had been around for thousands of years so the pharmaceutical companies cannot patent those medicines. Like most medicines their effects aren't the same for everyone.  When you consider that most auyervedic medicines come from plants which can have different levels of acive ingredients depending on where and when they are grown.  A heavy rainy season or a drought can increase or decrease the active ingredient of the plant.  With all this in mind, you shouldn't discount ""natural"" medicines simply because they don't work for everyone.The Sundown Ayurvedic Stress relief supplemets feature Ashwaganda root extract.  The pill is quite large but easy to swallow.  The capsule is vegetarian safe which means it doesnt have any gelatin or animal products.  My wife tends to be a type A personality so she suffers from chronic stress.  She tried one of these pills (the recommended dose is 3 but she wanted to start off small) and she noticed that she had a more restful sleep than usual.  The pill did not make her less stressed (only removing the stress can do that) but it did allow her to get a more restful sleep which helped her to deal with the stress a lot better.  She agreed to take the medicine regularly and has felt a lot better and a lot more rested.  Her stress still remains but her ability to cope with the stress is improved.Overall this is a great product.  The price seems high until you consider it has 90 pills and about on par with a 90 day supply of vitamins from my local pharmacy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28OZG5EGFITTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUHCROI#wasThisHelpful","R28OZG5EGFITTH","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I used it to charge both phones when connected to an original iPhone charger and also a generic 5V wall charger.  One major thing to note is that this cable is only 6 inches long so make sure it will reach your phone from its power point.

"A water bottle is just a water bottle right?  Not quite.  Contigo has managed to really improve on the water bottle and take it to a very unique and different playing field.  The Ashland Water Bottle is a great example of this.  The push button opening allows you to have access to your water only when you need it, no chance of spills or accidents.  The lock on the push button further ensures that your bottle won't accidentally open and leave you with a wet workout bag.  The bottle has a built in carabiner which makes it easy to clip this bottle to your bag so no chance of you dropping it or forgetting it.  The construction of this bottle is first rate with a very sturdy plastic that will resist shattering or breaking even when dropped fully loaded.  The only downside to this bottle is that you must drink from the built in straw so it makes ""air drinking"" or sharing of the bottle all but impossible.  Otherwise this is the perfect water bottle at a very reasonable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33E0T7K2E56FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYBBYN8#wasThisHelpful","R33E0T7K2E56FO","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The backpack is very durable and made of a soft touch material that seems like it should hold up to a lot of abuse.  It has numerous hidden features such as a rain cover and foldable ""meat shelf.""  The padded back makes this comfortable to wear even when fully loaded.  This is not a lightweight backpack and it is large but it feels a lot lighter and smaller than it is.  The only major downside to this bag is its extreme price, but considering its combination of flexibility and durability some may find this to be worth the hefty price tag.*** Positive Points: ***- Heavy duty soft touch material- highly configurable with numerous clips and options to create more storage space- side ""wings"" also have storage pouches for your phone or other small items such as ammunition- has 2 mesh water bottle pockets- has molded foam on the back which makes it comfortable to wear- zippers have pull loops that make it easy to open- padded shoulder straps make this easy to carry even when loaded*** Negative Points: ***- Heavy.

The blade portion appeared to be made of the same quality rubber though the steel of the Bosch brand did seem to be a bit heavier gauge. Both blades are quiet and clean equally well.  I have installed these in the middle of summer so I will update this review as time goes on to see which of these two blades lasts longer.  The Bosch costs about $2.00 more than the Pylon brand so it is roughly 30% more costly.

I will be honest that I was a little creeped out by the concept of a monster set for my 5 year old daughter.  Once she got the package she was so excited that she began opening it right away.  It was a bit too hard for her to build so her 10 year old brother had to help her.  The instructions really did help and once t was built it was fairly sturdy though as expected some pieces did fall off (as they do on Lego sets).  Overall this ended up being a very fun playset that girls will definitely enjoy.

"Case Logic makes some of the best camera cases available and this KDM 101 is no exception.  The first thing to note about this case is that it will NOT hold a standard sized DSLR camera in any way that could be considered safe.  I am not sure how some of the other reviewers are saying they were able to fit their DSLR (Canon T5) with a lens into this case but even the product description mentions that this is made for compact sensor cameras (AKA micro 4/3 sensor or mirror-less cameras).  You may be able to squeeze in a Canon EOS if you put it in sideways but you will risk some damage to your camera if the case drops).  I have attached a couple of photos so you can see this case (on the right) and how it compares with the taller KDH101.  As long as your are comfortable with the smaller size of this case it is a great way to store and protect your camera.  Personally I prefer Case Logic's Hammock Suspension Cases (such as the KDM 101) which suspend your camera allowing it to be stored safely while making it easy to access quickly.  Both Cases are excellent with the only downside being that they are a bit pricey.*** Positive Points: ***- Hard plastic base protects against bumps and small drops- Has a total of zippered pockets in addition to the main compartment (2 on the sides, one in the front and one on the top lid).- All the zippers have small pulls to make it easier to zip and unzip the case- Handle is integrated into the lid which makes it easy to pick up- Main compartment has a high contrast green lining and also a green zipper which makes it easy to see at night- Interior compartment has a divider that can easily be moved to the side- Lightweight while offering very good protection*** Negative Points: ***-  Does not have a ""hammock"" suspension system for your camera like the Case Logic KDH101.-  No waterproof cover (though the zippered areas all have a raised lip to prevent moisture from entering the compartments)-  Price is a bit on the high side","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24RSA6B3WHV82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQ8DRGE#wasThisHelpful","R24RSA6B3WHV82","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have gone through many keyboards over the years.  I have tried USB, wireless, Bluetooth, just about every keyboard technology that has come out I have tried.  I have used my phone and tablet with a couple of Bluetooth portable keyboards and while they worked fairly well, they were small and a bit cramped.  To make matters worse, my tablets did not quite fit into the slots so there was always a risk that they would topple over or fall off the keyboard.  This Belkin Keyboard proved to be a  very simple solution to make my computing a lot easier.The Keyboard works with just about any tablet or phone with a micro USB slot. My Dell Venue fit into its stand perfectly and once plugged in it worked without a hitch.  I also used it with my Samsung Note 4 Cell Phone and it worked perfectly.  The Keyboard  itself is constructed very well and has some weight to it.  This is not a portable keyboard so it is the perfect size to get some serious work done on a tablet or phone.  The stand portion of the keyboard is very stable and my Dell Venue Pro 8 fit in the slot even with its cover on.  Overall this is a great keyboard for productivity.*** Positive Points: ***- Works with most devices that have a micro-usb port (I used this with a  Samsung Note 4 phone and a Dell Venue Pro 8 Tablet)- Great construction that is heavy weight and looks like it will last- Keys are nicely spaced for fast typing- Keyboard has Media keys for Volume, Play, FWD, and Rewind- Easy to setup... just plug it into the micro USB port and you are done-  Cord can be stored under the Keyboard- Does not require any batteries and it has a very negligible impact on your device battery- Has dedicated Android Keys that can also function with Windows*** Negative Points: ***- The solid construction and durable material make this rather heavy- Not very portable","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L0UVZAKDOCUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4L721S#wasThisHelpful","R2L0UVZAKDOCUT","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Case Logic KDH-101 is a compact DSLR case that can accommodate a standard zoom lens.  I have a Cannon T4i with a 55-250 mm lens and it fit fairly well.  The Camera's width is a bit snug on top but it did fit.  If you camera is significantly wider than the T4 then you may want to consider a larger case.  This case has a solid bottom to protect from minor drops and it has the ""hammock"" setup which means your camera is suspended (lens down) through a fabric material.  This setup sounds scary at first but it works very well at protecting your camera and making it easily accessible.  This case is great at being compact yet providing good protection from minor bumps or drops.Although this case offers a great design and good protection,  my personal favorite case is the Case Logic SLRC 202 which more easily accommodates my camera and also has room for 2 extra lens or an external flash.  Also if you have a larger zoom lens you may want to consider the Case Logic DSH-103 which has an expandable base to make it fit just about any size zoom lens.  I have included a couple of pictures of each of these cases so you have a rough idea of the size differences along with a Cannon T4i for reference.  This KDH-101 is in the middle and is the smallest.  The DSH-103 (with the larger zoom capacity) is on the right and the SLRC 202 (with more storage space) is on the left.*** Positive Points: ***- Hammock system works well at suspending your camera- Has 2 pockets on each side along with a pocket  in front and on the top lid of the case (total of 4 pockets) which allows for storage of smaller items such as batteries, memory cards and filters.- Green contrast stitching is easy to see at night*** Negative Points: ***- Cannot accommodate larger zoom lenses- No waterproof cover- Not enough storage for anything other than the charger, batteries, or filters","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N3TRQYZTDVP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQ8DRL4#wasThisHelpful","R2N3TRQYZTDVP2","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Disney Cars Design & Drive Lighting McQeen seems like it would be a great toy for young Disney Cars fans.  The toy is very similar to the old Mr. Potato head toys that we played with in the past only this has car accessories.  It is great for kids up to about 5 years old but does not hold a lot of play value for kids much older than that (even though its recommended age range is up to 10).  My nephew who is 4 enjoyed playing with this for a few days and then quickly forgot about it.  Another thing to note is that the pieces, while easy to put on, don't seem very sturdy.  Considering this is almost $30 it is pretty expensive for what you get and it likely will end up as another unused toy in the toy-box.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHIJPLGC6VEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03TQZS#wasThisHelpful","R3DHIJPLGC6VEU","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 10 year old son is at the age where he loves Pokemon.  He initially was not interested in this book because of its bug theme but when I told him that maybe it was akin to Pokemon he became intrigued enough to give it a read.  Once he started the book he really enjoyed it.  The book was a bit too easy for him but it kept his interest and it proved to be a hard book for him to put down.

"We have used a variety of non-stick pans over the years.  Unfortunately most tend to lose their non-stick coating and actually make your food unsafe to eat.  This Fiesta non-stick pan is different.  It has a ceramic coating instead of the traditional Teflon.  This is supposed to be more safe while providing the easy to clean functionality.  Overall this pan works great.  It has a decent amount of weight without being too heavy and it heats up evenly.  The one big downside is that the handle tends to get hot since it does not have any type of shield or covering but other than that this is an excellent choice for a non-stick pan that should last for years.*** Positive Points: ***- Ceramic coating is safer than Teflon- Cleans up very easily and cooking is very even- Good size and weight*** Negative Points: ***- Handle gets very hot since it is not shielded- Instructions advise against using extremely high heat-","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LD0IL0L6W16R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZHNYV0#wasThisHelpful","R3LD0IL0L6W16R","A35IX2GE0VC0JP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35IX2GE0VC0JP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The filter looked very similar to the original cabin filter and even had the same carbon lined element to purify the air and remove odors.  It costs a fraction of what Lexus and Toyota want to charge and performs equally well.

"I think this is one of my favorite Doctor Who novels. Complex, dark, with witty banter, interesting characters and a fast paced and unique plot. This book is more of an adult level read, and not for kids or fans of the more kooky, outlandish science fiction Who is known for. This is a historically centered novel with more of a political thriller type plot, and I think children would grow bored with it pretty quickly.

Highly recommended for the more sophisticated Whovian.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R146MA6XJUFFTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARET2DU#wasThisHelpful","R146MA6XJUFFTA","A2UTHRUDG8DP07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTHRUDG8DP07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think part of the problem with all the negative reviews of this book is that it has been so long in coming and so hyped up by the author and fans that there is simply no way for it to be anything but underwhelming. I found Barker's writing style in this novel to be a refreshing change. I have always found Mr. Barker to be a bit verbose, but here his writing is a little more succinct. This novel is about the Hell Priest Pinhead's plot to take over Hell, and from there the other dimensions of creation, including Earth. Supporting characters include angels, demons and Lucifer Himself. Opposing him are the private investigator Harry D'Amour and a ragtag assemblage of offbeat characters who decide to aid Harry in stopping Pinhead and rescuing one of their own, whom Pinhead has abducted to use as bait. Ambitious and unapologetically graphic, The Scarlet Gospels is a satisfying story, with a bit too much chase, and too little character development, but I did not lose interest at any point. I think it will be a little more appreciated in the future, when the hype has died down and people can read it for what it really is rather than what they hoped it was going to be. In the end, I found it to be an enjoyable novel that is ambitious while being a quick read, not something we expect from Barker, who is known for his huge and belabored mega-novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WRLMS0T57D39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250055806#wasThisHelpful","R1WRLMS0T57D39","A2UTHRUDG8DP07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTHRUDG8DP07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these free in exchange for a review. Now, I am no audiophile, just a regular music consumer, but I found these to be a very nice set of headphones. The sound reproduction seemed very good, with good bass and good treble. I listen to a lot of different sorts of music, Devendra Banhart, Beirut, Modest Mouse, so a lot of acoustic guitar, horns, electronic sounds. Everything sounded really good. The headphones were extremely simple to pair with my Mac Mini 2014 running OSX Yosemite. Had no problems whatsoever. I am thrilled I got these for free and will be using them extensively so I will report back on longevity. The only criticism I could give them is that they are a little plasticky feeling and light.

"This is an absolutely excellent collection of short stories by one of my favorite authors. Of course, some of the stories in this volume are stronger than others, but that is to be expected of any collection of short fiction. My favorite story in this volume is ""The Yattering and Jack"" which is a tongue-in-cheek tale of a contest between an average everyday mortal and the demon sent to tempt his soul to damnation. It is hilarious and perverse and I have probably read it about ten times. The Midnight Meat Train is a spine chilling horror story about a man who falls asleep on the subway and wakes to find the other passengers butchered and hanging from the handrails. Very tense and gory, with an ending that will blow your mind. In the Hills, the Cities is a dreamlike story about two competing villages who strap themselves together into mountainous figures to do ceremonial combat. It great because it's so bizarre and original. The other three tales are worth a read, especially Pig Blood Blues, but didn't affect me as much as the three I mentioned previously. If you are a horror fan and have not read the Books of Blood, do yourself a favor and pick up all six volumes.

It didn't discolor my beard, which the other one did, and seemed to have a decent hold. Will not turn your mustache to concrete, but it held decently enough. I was able to style my mustache and beard and have it stay for about half a day. I enjoyed the scent, too, which is kind of citrusy. I have very thick beard hair, but I was actually able to style it, which was surprising.The picture is of my beard after using Fisticuffs Wax.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TRKQXZFGYGJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCI7V0O#wasThisHelpful","R3TRKQXZFGYGJ0","A2UTHRUDG8DP07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTHRUDG8DP07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay this hoodie is just awesome, I love it! Different than any other hoodie I owe and just looks hott on. I do recommend sizing up by a size or even two. Now, I did size up and what I got was a great match for me. Anyhow, this hoodie, is even better than I had expected, it has such a nice design, but the actually hood is just awesome.. it has such a wider shape and larger, while it's hanging, you can see the difference than a common hoodie. Also features a draw string. that works with ease.Sleeves do hang low, which is what I like and as far as length of the shirt it does hang below the hips, which is awesome cause I am not wanting something that will be above the belt in a shirt such as this. Now the model wearing the shir has on a bit differnt color than what I got, but it was just like all the other pictures, I think they are just showing you how it would look like on, still it is what I expected to get.As far as the cut of the neckline, it does come a bit love, and I love that. If you wanted to wear a shirt underneath, you could. The kangaroo pocket is nice and wide, and fitting for little things like keys. For care, I wash in cold water and hang to dry, since the material is stretchy and I wouldn't want it to shrink. I do this to all shirts of like material.Overall, I am pleased with the look and fit. The hoodie does have a awesome western type design and just looks sexy on. It is a must have, for anyone thinking about buying.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JCHAVQN1HUIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016LRZFAK#wasThisHelpful","R3JCHAVQN1HUIB","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Egaint 7in Phablet is a great choice, if your not looking to break the bank when it comes to buying a phone/tablet. It's priced lower than, some I have seen of it's kind, but don't let the low price fool you. It's got an appealing look and some speed, now it's not the fastest tablet, but your not paying the prices of an IPhone, it is what I would call a bargain price. It comes loaded with the basic apps and already installed is Google Play, which is a huge plus, cause it can be tricky to get. I downloaded all my daily apps, and so far, I have not meet an app that wasn't compatible. Email, Facebook, Twitter, GPS, and even my work apps, worked without a problem.As far as using as a phone, it works with ease.. sending texts, incoming text and calling works just fine, I used my AT&T Unlocked Sim in this phablet, and had no problems. I could hear good, get service, no issues to report. As a tablet, it is a great size, but as a phone, it's going to be huge!This device can also be used for watching movies. We have watched some shows on Netflix, my daughter even watches YouTube and the image is pretty good as for watching videos. Now the image isn't as sharp as a Samsung Galaxy S5, so don't expect that. But for the money, it's got a great image, it is a little dark but not a complaint. I was pretty impressed as far as the image, cause for the price, you really can't expect much. So it was better than I had expected.Speed, it's got some speed, now it's not the fastest running tablet, but it's sure not snail slow. Running the apps are faster than, surfing the web. It is a great tablet for all the basics, just not for multi-tasking, as I would have expected, for such a low cost. I even ran a benchmark test, (I downloaded off Google Play on to the device) which tested out pretty good with no stability issues either.The gyros work speedy, which is something I always look for in a tablet. As soon as you flip it, the screen rotation is fast.For the money, this device has some great features and so far been working just fine, but there is even more. This device has Bluetooth which is pretty much a must have now a days. Which is very impressive as most doesn't have that function and at the same cost. Speakers have a good little sound, but I always want more, so it's not going to be a problem to hook up a Bluetooth speaker or sync with Bluetooth in your car and listen to music from it or talk through it. This device even has dual cameras, now they are the best, but hey.. they do what I need them to do and that's what matters.Lastly, the device has a slim design and appealing look which is really important to me. I have seen a lot of tablets, some do look cheap but this device is not one of them. Also has a good strong body, it's even had some short drops on hardwood and it is still going strong. Has a good feel in the hand and lightweight. Now the battery life isn't that long, but if I need, I can plug up and use while it's charging and that's fine with me.I have to say, yes I am impressed with all the functions for the price of this device, it has everything we have come to expect as far as a tablet. The only difference is, this one comes at only a fraction of the cost. It does have potential to last and make a good tablet, but I also seen that it is backed by a 1 year warranty, which makes it a better choice than competitors, that is certainly something to have. This tablet would be great for using for the basics or for children, it's a must have for the price.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29YJS26KMX2U6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PK3V98#wasThisHelpful","R29YJS26KMX2U6","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't normally wear a sleep mask for may different reasons, but this one really caught my attention! Who wouldn't want to wear this and even be the queen in sleep!! Haha.. It's just too cute and super soft over the eyes. If your looking straight at it, like on someones face, it just looks super strange, but cool! The colors are soft and light. The crown does stick up over the head and just really serves it's purpose at night. But, my daughter snatched it right up from me as soon as she first seen it! Even though she is small, she can still fit it on her head without it falling off.It has a dual stretch bands, on me they are not tight and cutting circulation at all, it really doesn't even feel like it's there.

"I have to say, I am pretty impressed by this device at it's price. I honestly wasn't expecting to much from it, but it is soworth it and for many reasons. This little snake cord is going to fit into any tight places, such as piping, sewer pipe inspection,drains and just anything you can think of to use it for. Heck my husband even mentioned it would be something he would usefor engine inspection. Just any tight space like that, this little guy will be your buddy!It's simple to use and doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out. A cd comes with it and tells you everything you need to knowto get started. Then you just plug into a USB port and it's super easy to install. It's got some great features like LED lighting, to turnon or off, take video or just photos, as opposed to just video, this one does it all.Another great feature is the fact that this device is somewhat waterproof up to 8.55 in diameter.As far as the picture it provides, is a good crystal clear image, and you could certainly find leaks and such with it.

"First, I have to say this hippo was incredibly hard to place over the focet in my daughters bathroom. I don't know if it's just ours or what, but I did try over 2 different sized fossets and it was a work to get the cover over it. Secondly, this little guy has no hole in the top to work the shower head. Now, if I didn't have a second bathroom and tub, we wouldn't be able to use it. So be aware of that before purchase. With that being said, it is cute and was exactly what we are looking for, for many different reasons. First off, it's not a hard piece by no means, if my daughter bumps into it, she isn't going to get hurt. So it serves as protection also. She just loves it and that is what matters, I would like to get another one for the sink, which would expand the water reach, we did try this one over the sink first and it did work for that as well, just loose of course.

"Talk about being big clippers, these toenail clippers are huge! Which is why any man, would really like them. My husband just really appreciated the size and how much easier it is for him to ""clip"" than it would be with a common pair. Boy, they are made well to, I don't see how or why this set of toe nail clippers would ever break.As far as cutting, they sure get the job done with ease. My husband has the thickest darn toenails I have ever seen and it's like breaking a sheet of steel!

"Wow, just wow! First off, the appearance is quite nice. Each assortment made it's way to my home, unharmed exactly as the seller said so and still looking beautifully as it did when it went out. Would truly make a great gift, if you could make it that far! I sure couldn't! I had planned to gift to my dad, but I just wanted to try them out, then trying them out lead to them disappearing!The assortment of nuts were super tasty, but those cashews... yum! I could eat like a gallon of them! They are so thick and full of chocolate, soft and really rock the taste buds. Cashews have always been a favorite for me, but, I honestly never tried them with chocolate. Which I do love now, that's for sure.The pistachios really lived up to the title, ""Roasted Salted Pistachios"", which were bathed in salt and is just how I would expect them to be. Anyhow they were tasty and a second favorite.Now I am not a fan of just regular peanuts. Never been one to eat them, now if they are specially coated, then yes I will give them a shot. Which is why I did so here. The honey glaze on the outside of them was nice and a bit thick, with a great crunch and taste. Taste just like they sound and actually one of the best tasting of it's kind, in my opinion.There wasn't a single person in my family, that didn't like any of the assorted nuts. We had them gone in no time, that's for sure. Presentation was quite nice, everything looked good and not broken up in to chips, lastly, the nuts were not stale or hard. Certainly an a assortment that I would choose again, and far from tasting anything like something I have had from the store or in the gift section around holidays.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBUH3SCJ9UXSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015G9SH6I#wasThisHelpful","RBUH3SCJ9UXSJ","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As others have stated, this ashtray is small and a bit wide. But that isn't a problem for me, as far as putting a cigarette out. I think it has to do with you preference and the size of ashtray you are used to. For me the size is perfect, since I smoke outdoors because of my daughter. The ashtray has a lid that is easy to close, which is awesome since the wind isn't going to be blowing any cigarette ""butts"" out on the porch and such. For it's make, it does have a bit of weight, not saying it's heavy... but it won't be easy for the wind to blow it over.Now the cigarette holder is pretty sweet! Most always, my daughter is calling me in the house before I can finish, I never liked putting my cigarette down in a common tray at the ""lip"". Anyhow, it is easy to get the cigarette in the holder, it's more loose than it would be tight and is a great fit for my brand. Then to pick it up, is just as easy.The design is nice, just having a lid is great in so many ways. I always keep it closed as that is one of the first things my guests see when they walk up on my porch. The big old common tray that was there before.

"My husband and I are huge coffee loving addicts! Indeed, we love out coffee. Both need sugar to finish it off. Normally, we just reach for the bag in the cabinet and dip out what we need, which is why this little sugar bowl is going to come in extra handy at our Keurig.This little egg shaped bowl, is the perfect size to sit on the counter for it's purpose, we don't need a gallon bowl! When filled, it's not heavy and serves the purpose well. It really makes things more convenient to have it right in place making coffee, especially when we are in a rush of the mornings for work.When I first ordered, I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the shape and how it would look on the counter. Turns out, I actually love the shape and it's looks. I wouldn't have expected it to turn in to a little conversation piece either, but everyone that has been in my kitchen always asks me about it!The build is solid and strong. There is nothing cheap about this bowl. Steel is nice, thick and far from being thin, that it would be getting dinged and dented up. The lid fits perfectly, not loose or tight that it wouldn't go on. Features a little hole on the side for the scoop to fit nice and tidy. Then on the top it has a little ""thumb holder"" to easily lift open. The spoon is exactly a half teaspoon, which is the perfect measurement for it's purpose. Now the spoon is thick and durable, as well, and should never break. I stuck the set right in the dishwasher as soon as I got it, with no harm done.Salt would be ideal for storing in this bowl to, by the stove. Because of it's measure on the spoon and just size overall. I probably put half a teaspoon of salt, in most all of my dishes. Can be used for any type of spices or anything you desire.

"Before the Oak Leaf K-Cup Holder arrived, I had a good sized stainless-steel swivel, which was round. Let me tell you, it stuck out like a sore thumb, meaning it didn't look the best! It has now been retired and the Oak Leaf Holder was sure to take it's place. It just looks way better in so many ways. For starters, it's black and sitting right by my Keurig, matching the colors is just great. Has a good storage capacity, holding 30 K-Cups.Since I keep an assortment of roasts and different flavors of coffee, hot chocolate and such, a swivel bottom is a must have. The OakLeaf Holder does feature a great swivel and built on a sturdy stand. It's not a cheapo with just a wire stand. On the bottom of the stand, thereis a softness, to prevent any scratches being made to the counter-tops. Then on the top, there is a handle, if you to move it around in the kitchen, it's there, but I think it also adds a bit more to the carasoul as far as looks.Indeed this carousel looks pretty decorative on the counter and really servers it's purpose, well. I couldn't live without one now. But I alsowant it to look great in my kitchen and this carousel puts my old one to shame!

"I knew this easel would be a hit with my 3 year old as soon as I seen it, boy was I right! She loved it and has played with it ever since. It comes with a set of dry erase markers and lots of magnets. It's such a small design but the small size is really convenient to have. We can take it back and forth to her grandparents with out all the hassle and it hardly takes up any storage space. I am really loving it because, it is really helping me teach her numbers and letters. I get so many out and have her to pick up the letter I call out, she enjoys it, so it's a great learning toy too.No need to assembly, just need to put the dry erase board on with the two holders to keep it upright. The ""legs"" fold open and close.The ""desk"" has storage for all the magnets and the sides have room for the markers. It even comes with a little miniature dry erase marker.The board is great for it's design, like it's not super hard to remove the marker, which they work good and don't leak.There is even a clip that comes with this set, so if the child wants to draw on a piece of paper, they have that option.My main concern after seeing the drawing board, was how the ""arms"" was going to hold the board in an upright position. But I was fooled, they are are designed to go in the ""pockets"" of the board. Once you get it locked on right, the board does sit up nice and tidy without collapsing, which was my big worry. She can draw on the board, with out any problems as far as it falling down. The board sits right on top good, and keeps the magnets inside for storage.Overall, this little easel has meet my expectations. The magnets sticks well, without sliding off, everything is described correctly and is such a fun little learning center. Also comes packaged quite nice and ready to be gifted.

"These cars are just the cutest, little toys and certainly something you will not find in a store. They have so much detail going on and something any little feller would love! This set comes with 6 little cars are unique models and some have different features. For instance, the car with the latter, which is like a fire truck, the latter extends to a decent length. The helicopter wing spins and the concrete bucket can be turned.As far as quality, I think they are just a bit above average. No paint will chip, made of a quality hard plastic, wheels spin with ease and no issues to scoot across the floor. Each design is done in detail, on the inside is a image of people sitting in the car, like the fire car has two firemen on the inside wearing the fire hats and all correspond to the different model.Considered for children a year and up, there is nothing holding these cars back from kids of that age. The latter is wide and something that would not fit in their mouth, so age is really thought of here.Price wise, you get your moneys worth here. Indeed they are worth the price asked and would certainly make any little guy smile from ear to ear. I am more than happy to recommend.

"I have been using a ten inch round shower head, that I thought was the bomb, which in fact this rectangle shower head is even better! When I first seen it, I was pretty excited to install it, waiting on my husband to get off work all day.. He finally comes home and puts it in, well it took him all but 30 seconds, heck I could have just done that myself! The wide head has water coming out everywhere, instead of just hitting a small area of the body, it covers it all. The feeling is just incredible, this is something that you have to try for yourself, it can't be put in to words, it's that great.Now, the shower head is made of a hard plastic, but don't be worried. I have used them for a few years now, not this one inparticular, but they do work. This one does have to potential to last plenty of years, without issues. But, it doesn't not look like it is a hard plastic, it does look like it's stainless steel with a white top. The old round one I had was not even comparable as far as looks, you could certainly tell it was plastic, no doubt about that. Quality, seems to be quite a bit better and just has an overall better feel.Really loving the looks of this shower head. It screams with elegance and just looks good in the shower.Installation took my husband half a minute, everything to set it up comes included. There isn't a leak one, or even a wet spot behind the head.Something else that bothered me with my last one, it had a long arm bar and the head was just always falling down, with the rectangle shower head, that won't be an issue.Couldn't be any happier with this rectangular shower head.

"Wow, this sword and ""shield"" really has blown me away as far as it's features. The sword is just way cool and as a parent, it is probably one of the coolest ones I have seen yet. It does run off batteries, (not included). Which are easy to place. Once it is up and ready to go, it has a trigger on the handle. and boy is it a lot of fun! We took it outside one night and it just really lite it up outside. The kids had so much fun running around acting like they were alien slayers! My 3 year old daughter even loved this toy set! So girls can have fun too!!Both the armor and the sword, not only lights up but they both make noise! If you do it right, the armor will actually stay on the child. We make an ""X"" in the back and lock it, they will really need it like that if they plan to run around and chase, this will keep it securely on and will not fall off.As far as quality, I would have to say this toy set is made a bit better than average. I just think the quality and everything is better than what I am used to seeing on toys. Craftsmanship is quite nice and very pleasing to any kids! The armor does do a great resemblance, which is great for pretend play.That sword though, it is just awesome! And so much longer than I had expected. The kids really have fun with both, this toy is one that will be great amusement for kids of this age group, it is a must have for any little guy in to this type of play. It comes packaged so nice, but it's so simple to remove... as in.. it's not a battle to remove the pieces from the box, like everything is now a days! Ready for gifting.

"This train is even better than I expected, as far as looks and operation. Normally when we get a toy that sings or lights up, the activity only last for a slit second it seems and my kids would certainly like it to go on longer, instead of just pressing the button over and over, hearing the same old thing! That is not the case with this train toy. It really has long activity and I can say that it doesn't get old to me. As far a it being loud, yes it can get loud. But, there is two different sound settings. It's even more cute in person and my little one really enjoys it.A great piece for learning as well as motor skills and coordination. So many features here, like songs, the ball drop, actual movement from the train and has a bump and go feature. If it gets in a corner, it will get out! It seems like it lasts for so long without auto shut off, I would say about a min. It would be great to help a little one learning to crawl, as it would be something they would love to ""crawl after""! It does work on carpet, but works better on tile or hardwood, of course.As far as size, this toy train is not tiny. It is hard to judge from the photos, which I was expecting it to be a little smaller than it was. But is is actually the perfect size, it's not on the small size, nor is it over large.The lights on this toy train, is just awesome! If it is dark in a room, it will surely light it up. So we look forward to playing with it in the night to and just seeing it go. It will really help with eye movement since it moves around so good.Quality, is quite nice and a little above average. Very well built, wheels roll good. Tiny wheels for the bump and go feature underneath and spins, which all work well. Motor is working fine, no complaints here.It is certainly a toy that will put a smile on any little face and would make a perfect gift!

"This light is great for my kitchen cabinets and gives the perfect amount of lighting. It's not wide at all and not hanging down over the cabinet. As far as quality, it is more than average and certainly more than I expected. I don't see why it wouldn't last a long time. It's certainly not a dollar store deal!Installation was easy.Motion works as it should, no false detection and always works as long as you are in range.Powered with batteries, but not included.LED lighting uses less energy.Does not use any screws for installation, which is great, as a I would not damage my cabinets.This light would have a lot of uses, such as a closet, underneath counters, nursery, bathroom, stairway, hallway and such. As far as looks, it is not tacky looking and has an appealing look for its make. Body is long and slim and doesn't make the area look bad.

"Just like factory! I am more than pleased with these towing mirrors. I haul campers, trailers and anything that has a hitch and with my old mirrors, I just couldn't see jack. Let me be the first to say, if your hauling a large camper or anything, you will see entirely behind it. That lifts such a load off my shoulders, especially trying to back one in a tight spot in the camping area, I park mine at.How is the fit? Well perfect. I own a 1999 Chevy Silverado, holes and everything was lined up, nothing was out of place. It's just like factory but only a fraction of the cost. It seriously took me about 15 minutes to put them on, I had no problems what so ever. Cane with all the studs it needed to put them on, everything was fit perfect.Now the quality, is just like factory also. I was a bit worried they would look cheap and heck I was worried, if they would even hold on for the price. Don't be frightened by the price, these are built just as good as factory, they look just as good and they are sure made to last and be weather proof.I am beyond happy with them, It's nice to be able to see every inch behind the camper or anything I am hauling. These mirrors have really surpassed my expectations and are a fine set, if you are looking for a set of towing mirrors and want to see every inch behind you, these will not disappoint!I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q0AERC1QK8YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJZZ8IU#wasThisHelpful","R1Q0AERC1QK8YZ","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Expandable hoses have sure spoiled me, I will never use a regular hose ever again! With that being said, not all expandalehoses are going to work out. I got one about a year ago, that had plastic &&& and used it lightly and in the beginning ofthe year, it finally just exploded. The thread busted at the fittings, which were plastic. That is why it must be brass, which the Ohuhu 25 feetexpandable hose is.Takes up no space at all, compared to a regular 25 feet hose. It is only 8.2 ft, but expanded it's 25. The great part is that, the hosedoes not kink, nor does it have any leaks from one end to another. My old one always had a small leak at the fittings, whichwas a sign that it was bound to bust!Water is easy to empty entirely, I usually just spray it out, while the hose is shrinking.The spray nozzle is just like the one we bought at a local hardware store a couple years ago. So I am confident nozzle willlast a really good while without breaking down. It has different sprays and is made heavy duty.The fittings stay on nice and tight at the water spicket, outside.Regular water hoses get pretty heavy and with water, even more.. It's nice to not have to pack one all over the yard when myflowers and garden are in full bloom or when I am just trying to wash my car.

"I am a shoe fanatic and needed more storage, for my self, husband and kids. The Ohuhu Shoe Shelves is such a greatchoice as far as storage. The Ohuhu Standing Tier can be used as a whole or in different sections. What I did, was break it down insections for different rooms, which has made things look much more nice and tighty in every room.This shoe rack will require assembly, however, it's easy peasy! You don't need any tools, just the pieces that come with it.Now it's not a thick heavy duty piece, but if you do it right you do it right, this will make a great shoe storage.Since there is no bottom, you may think this shoe shelf is for larger shoes only, but that is not the case. The shelvingunit is actually adjustable, meaning you can place the poles out farther or closer together to create shelving fordifferent sizes. You can make it small, that even my 3 year old shoes fit.It is important to make sure that each pole, is strongly in the plastic pieces. Other wise it will collapse. Now that theshoe shelf is assembled properly, with shoes on and get pretty heavy... the rack is doing it's job. No issues as far asit collapsing.I am happy with it, my shoes are all nicely organized and saves me tons of space. Price wise, you just can't beat it, asshoe racks are always super expensive, this one is marked cheap, in my opinion. It is a must have for anyone that has lots ofshoes and needs a rack with out costing a hefty price.

"This spatula holder, will look good in any kitchen or theme, as it is stainless steel. It's large in width and will hold plenty of utensils, that's for sure! The bottom is pretty impressive too, it has drain holes, so if the utensils are still wet, there isn't going to be a puddle inside.Something else that is awesome, it has a thick and sturdy stainless steel design. This will not not get dented up like the last utensil holder I had to just pitch in the trash. It's great that they also thought of length, the tall holder makes keeps everything looking nice on the counter. The bottom is designed to keep any tipping from happening, which I filled mine plum full and it has a nice study stand.Last, the holder actually rotates, to easily find a utensil, without needing to pick it up! This little feature, is very convenient and does come in handy. The rotation works with ease.I see no reason why this spatula holder, wouldn't last a life time.

"I have a knock off version of the GoPro, not the name brand but a generic brand and was told that any accessory kit would be suitable and it is. I just have to use the heads that came with mine, which is what I would expect. My friend did get to test this kit out on his GoPro and it did work as well. Accessories are made of a hard plastic and durable, they do the job, without any complaints.Each different mount/accessory is actually pretty useful and will always be needed, at some point. I was expecting to have at least one or two that I wouldn't have no use for. My kit is complete and I will never need any more accessories to buy for my sports camera, I can do any sport, adventure, ect.. that I want to do.The harness is what I am most excited for!

"My husband has this exact same wedding band only in gold and silver. It has the same design but a little different look, not much it's hard to tell the difference, we paid about 250 for it, so there is a huge difference in price but worth it. I wanted him to have a second one for times he may be working in the garage and such and really as a back up in case he ever lost his actual wedding band.As far as durability, yes it's durable and strong, thick and all that good stuff. It's not a bubble gum machine ring, that's for sure! The inside is smooth and feels nice on the finger, the outside silver part of the ring isn't smoothed off  as you can see from the photos, which isn't really a big concern, you can feel it on the index and pinky finger though.The size was correct, I ordered a ten and the fit was perfect. Sizing is accurate.Comes in a ring case, fit for a man. Which is appreciated, it's nice to be able to gift something and not worry about gift boxing.He's happy with it and that is what matters!

"I have been into the whole organic world for while, but I have never actually made anything myself. But have always wanted to and that is what Leona Made Body Butter Kit is all about. It's organic and all natural, kit that allows you to make your own body butter. How cool is that!? It comes with all the ingredients you will need for this little project and is already measured. Only 4 simple ingredients to make some fabulous BB! Jojoa Oil, Coconut Oil & Shea Butter, plus the vial of lavender. Now that is the only fragrance that comes with this set, but you could add in something else.Following the instructions was easy, you will need some time though.The containers are just super cute. Save them if you ever wanted to make more using your own stuff.But man, that box and filler it comes in, is just insanely pretty! One of the most impressive gift sets, I do think I have ever seen. This is why this set would make a wonderful gift even more better. Heck, I actually won't even get ride of the gift box and filler, as it is just something I really like and will find some kind of crafty use from, i am sure of.Body Butter, came out with a nice thick consistency and just make my skin instantly amazing and will truly last you a good time. Combining these super ingredients together, there is a few things I want to try this mixture on like with some rashes we see. A little will go a long way and leave your skin feeling incredibly soft. No complaints, but I do think the price is a bit high, for the amount you get. Which is 4 ounces, I would have expected it be 12 at least. However, everything is organic, Fair Trade and all that good stuff, so yes that could be why it is marked so high, cause anything organic is going to cost a pretty penny, as it is.

"Sure, some think a ""Selfie Stick"" may sound silly, but in fact it's really not! You get great family shots, with yourself in the photo. Instead of being the one to take it or find a stranger to do it. Great scenery shots with your self, whether you are on the beach or at a family outting. They really are fun and make ""selfies"" even more fun. There is a lot to choose from, so know what you are getting and if it is going to be any good. Of course there are some good ones and then there is some duds! I happen to see quite a bit of duds at the flea market, a few weeks ago. Yeh, they where super cheap like $5 bucks, but when you picked one up, you would really see why it was priced so low, it was just horrible! Well this little gadget is not even comparable to the duds at the flea market, I seen and I know it works, who knows if they would.Anyhow, this one is easy to work and much easier than my old one. Which was like a jigsaw puzzle, I mean you had to do tons of different things just to set the darn phone in the holder, it was not an easy task. All you have to do here is one little step, that is by placing your phone in a certain position and raising the holder bar up. It will lock securely and hold the phone without it getting loose and trying to wiggle out.Have a phone case on your phone, maybe an OtterBox or something big and bulky? Well no worries, the extension bar is quite wide and is made to hold those large phone cases too. No problem holding the phone and case, with some room left to spare.Now if you don't have a case, then you might be worried this gadget could leave scratches on your expensive phone and who has the money to just run out and buy a new Samsung.. anyhoo, no need to be scared, the frame is actually cushioned and will prevent any scratches or damages to the phone!This selfie stick has a super long extended arm. of a total of 42"". Pretty impressive, I have to say as it has way more length than the other one I own. Bluetooth and of course easy to work, it doesn't get any better than that. But as far as make, has a solid build.. this selfie stick is durable, although it is lightweight. Strong extension with the phone weight on the end, which doesn't get bendy or wobbly. Snap selfies all day without an movement and capture the greatest moments. Going to be even more useful than I thought and way more fun to use!

The back even has an extension to fit for different shirt cuts.The necklace is just something else, with a lot going on. The peals and stones doesn't travel all the way up, about half ways. Then it has a beautiful chrome chain, that is not your average ""loop"" chain. It really looks appealing with the rest of the design and is not a ""plain jane"". The center has a dangling type pendant, of a good little size.The earrings are nice and on look with the design. They do hang quite a good length for earrings and stand out a bit more, with out being ""too much"". Both the necklace and earrings doesn't flip around and have a lot of movement and you won't constantly be trying to set them in place, which is always aggravating.This set is a very lovely set and would be perfect for weddings and more formal events.

"The scrubs are made of a great material and above average, I would say. Most are tissue paper thin, these are far from that. Material is a bit thicker than average and crafted quite nice without any imperfections. As far as size goes, they do run small, so size up. I would normally wear a large, so I got XL. The legs are a bit tight, at top but nothing I cant deal with. The shirt is fine and fits great. It is a big loose, but hey that is how I like the tops. It's always comfortable to have a more loose top.Lots of colors to choose from here, I went with purple and happy I did. The color is bright and vivid and sort of has a glossy type finish.Pants features a draw sting, which is a must have.Lots of pocket space, which is always a good thing.

"I love my jewelry, that's for sure. But like any other gal, I don't want it to cost an arm and a leg and I can't always afford that. Well that is where EleQueen, comes in. Affordable jewelry, without breaking the bank. This set is surely something else and different than what I am used to. It's lovely and elegant without costing an arm! Really, it's cheap. Don't let that scare you, cause the set is made well and sure to stand out. First off each pendant is hanging from a heart design, with small stones. Which makes this set unique and different that what I am use to. The blue Swarovski Crystals are in the shape of a tear drop and just look fabulous. This set is really made to go with formal attire or evening events, but it can be worn down, with a low cut shirt. Probably without the earrings if you are looking to go casual.Not that they are heavy, the pendants do have a bit of weight. In this case is great, it keeps them from moving so much or getting flipped around. The chain is of a good size and hangs low, but it has adjustable length for different necklines.Earring are exactly alike as the necklace. Nothing different, in fact each pendant is the same size, just over the length of my thumb nail, to get an idea. Not over sized or to small.No irritation on my skin or colors transferring.Designed well without a flaw and made strong.Now this set is not just for a select age group, it would be something the younger generation would like and up.

"Holy moly, I am truly blown away at the beauty here! Yeh, I was expecting them to be pretty and all, but wow they really made my jaw drop! Pretty is not even the word. The colors are so bright and vibrant and really stand out. They will be the most amazing Christmas decor, I own, I really believe!The description does say, to hand wash because the paint could chip. So I am not even going to bother using them to drink from and use solely for decoration. So I would like to get another set, or even two! The kids are going to want their own for juice or milk. I'm sure it would be a special little feeling drinking from these beauties!As far as size, they are not small that is for sure, they are an oversized wine glass. So there is more to love! I'm sure it wouldn't take much to chip paint off any glass piece such as this. Just be careful, if you put them in a cabinet and don't let them hit something else. When mine arrived, they were unharmed and not a speck of paint was chipped. They do come in a cute Christmas box, so this would be a perfect gift. Also keep it for storage, since it does come with a foam for the top and bottom.The colors are just extra bright, the stem is painted in 3 colors, striped, like a candy cane. Then the belt does circle the entire glass. Bottom is nice and sturdy, as you would expect.I couldn't be more happier, I am really in love with the set.

"Like most ladies, I love my purses and I have a ton of them! Since most of mine are larger in size, I have been looking for something that was smaller and matching my style. The YOUNA Handle Tote fits the bill perfect. A small average size purse, with a stylish design, I am really digging the look and yet it still holds the items I need to carry on a regular basis. It is the ""bucket"" look, which, I for one LOVE! It's nothing fancy, but casual and cute. Now it doesn't have a shoulder strap but it has long handles and can be carried right over the shoulder or by hand.The material is soft and thin, yet it's not to delicate or fragile and made of PU Leather. It does look good. On the inside it has a strong fabric lining. Which actually I was not expecting much from it because it is priced for just under 20 bucks. It has kind of surprised me, though. As long as it's taking care of, the bag should hold up in time. Now, the shoulder straps are also soft and feel good over and soft.Crafted quite nicely, with a button lock on the inside and actually stays closed with no unexpected openings. The button seems to be reinforced really good and wouldn't pop off at the slightest touch. Other than the button, there is really no hardware, but a zipper pocket. That opens with ease. Then of course, two opened pockets that are a good little size to hold things that you need on the fly.The bucket bag does sit up nicely on it's own.As far as the make and look, this bag is quite nice, there is only one complaint. I did smell a strong odor at first and very unpleasant. I have had other PU Leather bags that had a similar unpleasant smell, I think that could be the reason? So I don't think it would make that great of gift for someone unless you kept it a week and let it air out. Other than that it's a great little, causal bag and the size will fool you, it does carry more than I expected.

"Tongs are one of the most needed kitchen utensils in my home. I use them for everything, more the the average person would, I would guess. Anyhow, having 1 good set is all you will need. I have had plenty of dollar store tongs and they just don't do the trick. They seem to rust in no time at all and just fall apart. The Ohuhu Tongs are no comparison to dollar store deals. First off, they are made with a nice thick stainless steel and should never rust. Has a silicone top, to get a good grip, and last a locking mechanism, that you push. Not a cover, that slides over. No unexpected opens in the drawer, easy to clean and everything that set of tongs needs to be.As far as make, they are solid and should have no problem lasting a lifetime.They get the job done and come at a bargain of a price, I would recommend.I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129XXEW11XQPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PVJOTGG#wasThisHelpful","R129XXEW11XQPR","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, the clock is very thin, but for the price, I was not expecting much. With that being said, indeed it is different and it looks really good on the wall. I am more than pleased with appearance. It's unique and actually it's the first thing regular visitors notice when they walk in my kitchen, now. With nothing but compliments.So the cutlery is not real, however I do not see this as a downside. In my eyes, having a real spoon or fork, in my opinion it would look a bit tacky. I like the soft look they have and resemblance they have. Size is not as long as your common fork or spoon would be either. This is made to be a resemblance not, a real set.As far as working, it takes one battery, that is it. Motor works with out issues and keeps the time accurate.There is a slight sound, it is soft and does not irritate me. I did have one clock that was so loud and obnoxious I had to actually remove. I actually never heard this clock till now, when I was trying to listen for it, so that is a good thing!If you look closely at the large hand and small hand, the hands are actually a fork and a butter knife. Which is really neat.Matches any theme, in the kitchen. Mine is roosters but the color of this clock is made for anything. It's not a huge design but not super small. but does give a nice little pop of decor. I love it and will never retire it. Heck, if it were to ever quit on me, it's still something that I would love just as decor only and well worth the asking price. It's thin and all, but it's cute, I would recommend.I received this product free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNO7C7VSDXNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8JH8VW#wasThisHelpful","R2XNO7C7VSDXNG","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"License Bling! Yes, please! These frames are really awesome and different from anything else you will see on the road! There are some out there I have seen online, that are a bit ""too much"", these are perfect, and isn't ""too much"". The color is pretty cool, they really show up on my black Ford Escape and looks wicked cool.As far as the frame, it is made of a good steal, it's solid and isn't thin, nor is is bendable. Now there was only one rhinestone missing which is really good so far. They have held up for a few days as well on my car.Fitting- the frame does cover the the county on the license plate as well as state. Which I really don't feel like that would bother anything, the number is up and that is what matters.Now, the tags come with bling caps and screws for installation. The caps are extra nice, cause you won't wont a screw to be seen on your bling frame. Just put the caps on strong and they should have no problem staying on.

"My daughter just loves to color, she doesn't mind what the character is. The MLP Coloring Book is is much different that what we are used to because it works along to with an app, that you download right from your phone. Also comes with a stylus that is in resemblance of a crayon that is just adorable. Now the app works just fine, had no problems as far as crashing or anything messing up. Color right from the coloring book than you can finish with the app. It's really neat to go from ""analog"", I guess is what you would call it these days, to ""digital""! Picking up right where you left off at.Bottom line, my daughter had fun with both the app and the the book, there wasn't any adds popping up and made things go a lot smoother, hope that we will never see any adds!!

"We have had a ton of sippy cups, that my daughter just loved and turns out most are leakers! Since she would not let me throw them away, mom is always chasing them down and making sure they are not tipped over. Cause my little one likes to just throw them down, where ever she is at. So she loves Lilo & Stitch, I knew she would go crazy for this cup, I was right of course, but actually I am also crazy over it too. because... it does not leak! I wont have to worry about chasing this one down all day, it has not leaked a drop so far.Normally I don't buy any sippy's that have any attachments underneath the lids, cause they are silicone pieces, which are harder to clean. However, this cup does have one under the lid, but it's not silicone, it's the same hard plastic that the cup is made from. Which is also BPA Free, or we would not own it. BPA is now proven to leach into liquids or foods and can cause medical problems, so we stear clear.So.. the sippy is made nice, with the cute Lilo & Stitch characters, colors are bright and vibrant. The ""spout"" is longer than the ones we normally find, which is probably better. Lastly, the bottom has an outer ring, to keep it stable when on surface. It's a pain trying to place a sippy in the cabinets! The price is fitting for the cup, it's easy to clean. I just use a bottle brush, however, it's not dishwasher safe.

"I am always on the hunt for sexy, lingerie sets that is flattering and fitting, this one takes the cake of all. Pretty isn't the word for this lingerie set, it's simply gorgeous. There is so much detail going on here and this little number is extra special. For starters, it is see-through, but the material is remarkably detailed. The chest is by far my favorite part of the design. Lots of swirly dudads, at the chest, while the rest has a elegant flower and other designs all through out. Now the bottom, oh my, it's extra sweet.. with little fringes all around the front, not full but simple which really adds spark. Then the back is solid mesh and no pattern.Ms Demon sure does have quality items and makes wonderful lingerie sets. As far as quality, um yes it's above average. It's thin, yet it's not delicate or easy to damage. The mesh material is slightly soft, without being itchy on the skin. The craftsmanship is just as impressive, there isn't a single flaw and sewn with out a frayed edge.Fitting was just as expected. I am about 170 pounds 5'9 inches tall, chest size of 34C, the fit is perfect on me and will fit smaller or larger ladies, since the material is nice and stretchy. Now the cut on the neck line is different and unique, it has a low round or like a oval cut shape and looks super on. Straps are a bit wider going up and is adjustable, for a custom fit. The panties are a solid design, mesh thongs. That fit as well and comfy on.I am so blown away at the beauty of this set, it's really something. Then on the front has this small yet long bow that adds even more spark. This one is now my top favorite and will be hard to find another as hott as this one. The price is very fitting to this set and very well worth it. As far as cleaning, I wash in a lingerie bag as I would with any such piece, on cold wash and hang to dry. Haven't seen any damage and I'm confident it will keep just fine. This lingerie set is a must have for any lady looking for sexy, classy and flattering.

"Pretty, doesn't even begin to describe this low cut shirt.. in my eyes, it's more than just pretty! Charming and stylish, yet sexy and appealing. For something that is a solid color is a little harder to be appealing, but this one has a lot going on. Quality is top of the line, not a single flaw. Material is nice and far from being just a ""thin top"".First off this shirt hangs longer than most, which is something I always go for. I love a cute top that hangs longer. I wear skinny jeans mostly and sometimes like to have a longer hip shirt and let me tell yah, it looks amazing and flattering with a pair of skinny jeans or even boot cut. As far as the neck line, it has a V Neck, that is extra low, on me anyhow and shows plenty of cleavage. My cup size is not huge but maybe average?? Anyhoo a C, it's very low, which is fine by me, I mean most of my shirt are low anyways.The sleeves really take this shirt to a whole different level and entirely different than what I am used to, they are wide and longer than average. Yet, unique and appealing. Love to dress different than others. I do love the sleeves, the look is awesome.As far as size, order up. Which is what I did. Normally I would probably go with a large, but got an extra large. It fits me like a large. So as far as the way it fits, it's kindly loose, of course at the bottom and and sleeves. It feels nice on the body and doesn't have any scratchiness, it's soft and pleasant. If you are looking for a sexy, different look this shirt will not disappoint.I received this product  at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7V3YRGUIS44K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0162K8CSI#wasThisHelpful","R7V3YRGUIS44K","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always hesitant of electronics that are not mainstream name brands, with that being said.. I have been wanting to get a ""sports camera"" for a while, but I am not willing to give my right arm for it!  Waiting for that day that the price will drop tremendously on a GoPro, but that isn't happening. So instead of forking out hundreds of bucks, how bout just give the MAOZUA Action Camera a shot. Well this little gadget is wicked cool. I am using for a lot more filming that I thought I would and has turned out to be one of the most handy little electronic devices I own. For starters, I wear it on my head with the belt provided, while I am filming Quad-Copter flights, rock climbing, and rafting are just a few things I have used it for already. Next summer, we are taking our annual trip to Mexico where we will be scuba diving, so I am really looking forward to that trip with this little guy! The fact that it comes in a waterproof box just opens up a whole new world of filming, it's really amazing. This is really the gadget, I wish I had owned years ago.This device is incredibly small, without the case it's actually quite smaller than the palm of my hand. The smaller the better, right! Don't let the size full you though, it has a lot of capabilities, easy to use and has an true, high quality image on screen. Importantly, this sports cam does have instructions. I have read that plenty other brands, came with nodda! Instructions are detailed and explains different settings, but it also tells you how to set up the attachments, which was pretty tricky at first.As far as speed, this device is speedy and doesn't lag after pushing the button. Truly is a action camera and gets great shots at moving objects. Even used in the car, going a good speed, nothing was fuzzy blurry. This thing is wicked, that's for sure.Now the water-proof case is a bit hard to open. After the first couple times, it will get easier. But hey, it's appreciative to at the same time that it is hard to remove, which keeps me at ease while I am in a water setting with it.Even more impressive, on the back is a 2.0 screen, to line up shots and such. Even the quality on it is amazing.Besides the fact that it is a wicked device, how well is it made? Well, it's top notch, I would say and has the potential of lasting quite a long time. The arcylic case is thick and does not leak what so ever, the actual camera is nicely made. I have to admit, I was not expecting much at all for a sports camera in the 60 dollar price range and to function the way it does. High quality images, I mean for real it is the real deal and it will not cost you an arm and a leg. Although it is priced pretty darn cheap for it's kind, don't be scared of the cheap cost. By no means does it look cheap, nor is it low quality. I'm still trying to figure out how the can sell such a device for such a low cost. I'm highly impressed!If you are looking for an inexpensive sports camera, without breaking the bank, MAOZUA Action Camera is priced low and does it all but for a fraction of the cost. It's really a gem and comes with plenty of attachments that are all useful. You can't get no better, I feel great recommending.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OZG5OQ7QRGA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010WTLYE4#wasThisHelpful","R1OZG5OQ7QRGA2","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leona Made, has some amazing products and the Baby Shampoo was certainly no disappointment. It's actually pretty hard to find an amazing organic shampoo/body wash, that doesn't leave my kids hair dry and brittle and feeling like sand paper! Yes, a lot of them cause my daughters hair to feel really rough and hard, then I have to apply conditioner to her hair, which isn't tear free or organic, so really it defeats the whole purpose. Also, it has such a great, rich later and a little goes a long way, which is really appreciative to me, since I could never get a good later from some of the brands I have had in the past.One thing for sure, this baby shampoo and body wash is tear free! My child is the worlds worst, for letting me get the shampoo out of the bangs area, heck she is 3 years old and I still only use organic/tear free on her and always will. Anyhow, everything that we get says, yeh this is tear free, when in fact it is not and always tears her up and hurts her eyes. Which that is the biggest surprise about Leona Made, it's true and is the first that really lives up to it's description.At first, yes I did think 17.99 was a bit higher priced, but after the experience I have had with my kids using this 2 in 1, I have come to conclusion that it is really worth it's price in gold! It's made in the USA, completely organic, Gluten-Free and so much more that I could go on about. It's the real deal.My daughter has sensitive skin and isn't effected, what so ever with this body wash, nor does it leave her skin dry, but actually it helps keep her smooth and soft. Even has a nice smell, it's not over powering but simple and pleasant.Really, it does live up to its description and it truly tear free, I had to test it my self to actually believe it! It really gets the job done with a rich bubbly lather and does a mighty fine job, I am impressed and it is a must have for any parent looking for a true tear free, completely organic 2in1 Shampoo/Body Wash. Heck, if you don't like it for any reason, there is a 100% money back guarantee, it don't get no better than that!I received this product free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQYHB5IATGRH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01672BWHO#wasThisHelpful","RQYHB5IATGRH3","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We go camping quite often and stay for a week at a time in the summer here, on the lake, having bright light at night is a must. Lanterns just aren't the same anymore as they used to be, they are completely different. Anyways, where it took fuel and a lighting it, now they are batteries, which is far more easier and more safe. When I first got this camping lantern, I had to chuckle! Seriously, it's super tiny! I wasn't expecting expecting much at all, that's for sure. Anyways, I was certainly made a fool. I turned this little baby on and my mouth hit the floor! I could not believe just how bright this little thang is, it is surely more than I expected, but also even smaller than I expected. In a small tent, it will light up the entire tent, inside, there is no doubt about that.As far as being small, don't let the size fool you, it packs a bright light and also has many advantages for being so small. For instance, storage space, packing it on the trip and storing at home, it takes up hardly no room. Also, the small size is just better for this type of activity and easier to pack around at night if your traveling back and forth to different tents.This little guy is also light as a feather it seems, but don't let that scare you.. it is durable and constructed quite nice. Made with a hard plastic and is tough, if it falls it's not going to break. What's even more impressive, it's also waterproof! Yes, that is way awesome. Features 5 light modes and is easy to navigate through.What's even greater, is this light doesn't need any fuel haha.. but it doesn't run off batteries either, it charges right off a USB cable. That's right, you will be able to charge it right from the car, if you have USB charging or a cigarette outlet. Heck, if you bring your laptop camping, you can charge from it. Anyhow, on a full charge the battery has an a really decent life, of 4-5 hours. Really that is about all that I would need at night, since it takes longer to get dark on the summer nights.Most importantly, this lantern can be hung, this little feature is a huge feature that would be a deal breaker. I don't think I would want it, for real if you couldn't hang it in the tent.Technology, has sure came along way and this proves it. For such a small device, it really packs brightness. You won't have to worry about a fire. It's small and compact and will not be in the way. Also, has the potential to last for many years, I am just blown away here, it sure is a must have for any camper and will not disappoint.I received this product free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BHYX9251VL67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158GXSHW#wasThisHelpful","R2BHYX9251VL67","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Solar String Lights by LiteXim is different from any other sets, they are much nicer and the look is a lot different, the lighting effect isn't the same far away, of course but up close they are really something! Right out the box they was working and have an automated timer, that will only come on in the dark. They are solar powered so they will never run up the electric bill.The lights are so beautiful and seem to be high quality, the actually ""globes"" are like a hardened plastic, maybe? They are heavy and durable. Needs to have direct sunlight and make sure you place where they wont be blocked in the afternoon, which will determine the hours you get at night. I am getting about 3-5 hours at night, cause there is trees across the street and the shadow in the afternoon blocks the sun from hitting it. Still yet, 3-5 hours is pretty good.I really don't have anything negative to say about them, only that they were really hard to separate, the wiring was really tight and hard to undo, cause the globes are larger than a common light.They are fancy, though. As far as brightness, they do put out a little amount of light. Also, the wiring from ground to globe could have been a bit longer. As some of the globes are on the rails. They are doing their job though and look amazing. Even surviving a few heavy storms, they are still going strong.

"My guitars mean more to me, than anything I own. I do have a hard plastic case to store them in, but I have a $2000 Blue Ridge, that I have always wanted to hang on the wall in my room, cause it is a beauty. I have plenty of stands and similar units to hold them on, but they are just to wobbly and with kids running around, I got really nervous, so that was the reason I switched to a hard case. This is the first time using a guitar wall mount. Instead of using the screws that come with, I used toggle bolts instead, it's just me, I always do so with anything on the wall that has weight. Got it mounted and hung my Blue Ridge and it looks amazing. It's not touching the wall and the mount has a cushion to keep from scratching the neck. Also, it just makes things so much easier, when I am playing instead of putting it back in a hard case. I sometimes play a little while at a time through out the day, now it's really easy to just hang on the wall. The kids know to stay away! The guitar does hang pretty snug, so I am not scared it will have an accidental fall.Mount is simple and looks good, not bulky. The guitar looks awesome hanging up. I would like to get another for my electric. By far beats a stand, I will never own another now, or the ones I owned!

"This listing has many different styles of dresses and different sizes, one reviewer mentioned that the dress didn't look like the picture, but that is because there are 2 similar styles and in different colors, I believe that is why. With that being said, I order the ""Purple Galaxy"" Dress and in a ""free-size"" and let me tell you, it's adorable! I am not a teenager, but in my mid twenties. I love the style. The sizing is perfect, I am in a size 9 in jeans and 5'9 it is a little shorter on me, cause I am kind of tall. The material is stretchy and would allow for different sizing.The dress, looks just like the picture and the colors are kindly darker, the pinks are more brighter, anyhow just as expected. Lots of detail going on with the pattern and multi-colored. Neckline is more higher and what is called a princess cut, it's not one that shows cleavage, which would also make it more appropriate for the younger generation.They wasn't cheap with the material, it's not super thin, but not thick, it's average and stretchy, to form a nice shape of different body shapes.Piped threading, which is nice and straight throughout and no frayed edges. Material is sort of like a nylon, extra soft and feels great on. No itchy's or anything weird going on, here. The bottom does have the ruffle type skirt just like in the photo, that is super cute and adds a lot more than just having a ""flat end"". Has a nice sway as you walk. I wouldn't say it is something that could be worn to homecoming, but to a dance or something or a night out. It's more casual, but sexy. Matched with a nice pair of heels this little dress is killer.

"I don't think one can have to many food containers with lids! We have a ton of left overs it seems, every night. I hate to throw it all out, cause I try to incorporate it in a different meal the next night, like soup or something tasty. I also don't care to much about using plastic containers. I read too much online about how it the chemicals in the plastic, can leach in the foods. So I am now trying to move all the plastic out and replace with steel. Plastic baggies aren't an option either and honestly, they just get too expensive for a good brand and only a handful. The Steelware Set are just what I am looking for. They are a little smaller, but the size is still nice. I will always be able to use them for smaller portions that are left, I would love to see the next size up from this brand.To start off, the steal is of a high quality. It's not thin and they will never bend or get a dent. The lids are extra nice and a whole lot better than any common pop on lid. These have 4 lock mechanisms. They easily fit on top and easily snapped shut. They fit perfect, so it's not a fight to get them on and they seal tight, which will help keep the foods fresher longer.Not only are they useful for storing foods in the fridge, but they are perfect also for packing snacks on the go or attending football games this season. I will never use a plastic food container for on the go snacks. The Steelware Set are the perfect sizes for snacking, for the kids.Nice appearance, two sets to choose from. One was multicolor that looked really cool, I ended up going with the stainless steel, but I wouldn't mind another set in the colored! Lids have a ""flat top"" that way you can stack in the fridge or sit something else on. Each lid is partially see-through, even though each are diffenent sizes, this also helps someone else be able to look through when looking in the fridge for something to snack on. My kids would probably just take the lid off and not put it back on, as they do with any! So this is extra helpful, to me.The price may sound a little high, but actually it's not a high price for a nice stainless steel set like this. In fact, it's hard to find a high quality set like this, when cheap sets cost the same really. They'll never rust and will last you forever. The bowls can be used in the dishwasher, but would probably be best not to run the lids through. Plus the lids are a lot better than a common set, they are thick, don't bend and stay sealed and will do good in long term use. They have tons of uses, I would certainly recommend.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QUU5NCARV0JE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VL5NX6#wasThisHelpful","R2QUU5NCARV0JE","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Artemis Candle is very elegant and such a lovely design. I am very impressed with the appearance. It's also more for looks, I would say than for scent, as it is not a very strong but light fragrance. Know this before you purchase. It's so gorgeous, it hurt to burn it! The glass is so elegant and has a beautiful outer ""cut"" on the glass, the shape is very lovely and unique with a topper.The way the purple wax hits this glass jar is extraordinary, which is why I am not to fond of burning it. I want to always keep it for decoration. Only problem is, one is not enough! I would love to have another or 2 for my end tables. They go will with any color or theme decor and really adds a spark.If you do burn it, which I did for couple hours, there is 3 wicks, the flame makes an amazing look and gets really bright and inviting.It's not a large candle, but not tiny. To give you an idea, it's just over the palm of my hand.The topper (lid) fits easy on, it has to be in lined with the ridges, but it's stays fit. Has a ribbon on top that really adds touch more to the piece.I certainly was not expecting to this candle so gorgeous for the price it sells for at 10 bucks. It's well worth it just for looks.I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4WQSJVUTTKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RIZ8G0#wasThisHelpful","RL4WQSJVUTTKX","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually do live by a REAL cat lady. She don't have just 3 or even 4 cats, she has about 14 cats at this moment, none of them are ""fixed"" and they just keep multiplying. I love animals, don't get me wrong, but I sure the heck don't like when they are climbing on my brand new cars and leaving feces in my yard, tearing up my expensive lawn chairs and everything else. It's getting to where it's more than just a nuisance for me and the neighbors. There is no ordinance, where I live. I just have to deal with it. I have tried making mixtures of pepper, cayenne pepper, you name it. Nothing seems to work on them. They are also a bit feral, they will not let anyone around them, only the owner. With that being said, when I first opened the container, one of those cats came right up to me sniffing around and curious, where I was placing it at. It actually drew him out, otherwise he would have never came around me. I used the whole container on a small area, I crossed both porches, I even dumped some on my back porch and in the chairs.Does it work? It's hard to say. I haven't hardly noticed a difference with them, maybe one or 2 stays away, doesn't come around as much?Maybe I need like a 10 gallon buck or 20 of this stuff or just to move! It did not completely rid my problem of them, but I think it could be helping slightly, but only with a few of them. Maybe I am expecting a little too much? But my case of cats may be a little to extreme for something to stop them from coming around. I would just like for them to stay off my porch chairs and off my car and I dumped a whole lot of it around the car and porches.The smell is very strong, but it does seem to die down after being out a little while. We have also had a few good rains since I got it, and the repellent isn't just absorbing completely away. On heavier areas, I can still see it. The repellent comes in a plastic shake container. It's not messy, but will get a little ""dusty"".I can't say that every cat would be the same and come sniffing it up, like the one did. It's just one of those things you will have to try your self and see if it will work on the cat.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LFIYL10B4VAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I8IR9A#wasThisHelpful","R2LFIYL10B4VAQ","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We like to go hiking down at the falls and when the weather permits, we go hunting for mushrooms (dry land fish). Normally, I grab a stick, when I find a good one in the woods to help with hills and just to have it, but now I can just take the Trekking Pole and leave it in the car from now on. It's also much better then a stick, I found in the woods, that's for sure!The Trekking Pole is very useful and convenient to have, when you are in the woods. First off, it collapses. Doesn't take up much space and can fit into my hiking bag. The aluminum pole is sturdy and not one that will easily break. Has a comfortable, cushion like handle and designed with a curve, for a good strong grip. The pole extends, to 47 inches and at each ""fold"" it locks into place.Also, comes with 2 rubber tips. These are great, especially for wooded area. They actually don't sink in the soft dirt.Has a lanyard type strap at the hand, to wrap on the wrist. Design is appealing. It's far from being plain. I went with the green and happy with the looks.This Trekking Pole is made to last, it also comes with a fitting storage bag. I plan to just leave in in my car. It's very handy to have in the woods, especially if you are walking up on a snake! It's priced reasonably and crafted well.

"I got to admit, this thing is way more than what I had expected. In person it looks so much like the real deal. Also, it's huge! Far from being small in width, that's for sure. It's even more powerful than I would have thought.As far as material, it has a soft jelly like feel, thick in width and extra long in length. The suction is very strong, don't worry it could accidentally pop off, it's not unless you force it off. It will stick to a wall, metal, plastic and even wood. I don't think there is a surface it wouldn't stick on.Everything is detailed from top to bottom, varicose veins all through out, just like the picture.Speed is nice, nothing extra strong, but certainly not light.

"The Freeker is pretty ""magical""! Extra strong vibration with plenty of speeds to change up for different moods. Has a great appearance and little different than a common vibe. Width is nice and length is of a good size. As far as texture, it has a soft silicone material, sorta feels velvety. Love the color, bright and vibrant, purple.

"Powerful? Yes, three different modes to switch through and offers a strong vibration. Small? Yes, but judging by the photos I kind of expected it to be so, so yes I am giving it a 5 star rating. It's something that can be used for beginners, experts or in between. Works a little differently than what you would expect, or what I am used to seeing. The bullet contains the battery and delivers the ""power"". but you can actually control it removed, like a ""bullet"" as well. Unit is flexible and has a velvety silicone type material, that is soft on the skin. Light in color and shape is different but pleasureful.

"This umbrella is just lovely, I ended up going with the purple on black design and I am really intrigued by it. First off the color is so bright and vivid, but the flower design is just absolutely gorgeous. I don't usually get too excited about a umbrella, but my goodness this is so pretty and cheap. Well, priced cheap that is but as far as quality, it's way more than it's price.Hardware is solid, nothing to be worried about. Canopy is strong and durable, no leaks, has a nice thickness and has a very wide open. To me it seems to cover more area then my old umbrella. Handle has a good feel and non-slippery.Much better than a common umbrella, has a button that opens/closes the canopy. While the arm isn't retractable, this is still really handy and is a nice feature, (will never use a common umbrella again) especially, while getting in the car during the rain. The feature to close the canopy, makes things so much easier and able to get in the car more quickly.Has a cord at the handle, to hang and comes with a cover to place over the unit while not in use.While closed, the unit is small (not a standard size) could easily fit in to a purse. Canopy closes up nice and neat and doesn't take up much space.I'm more than happy with this umbrella, I love the print, but most importantly it's well crafted and with quality materials. Above average for the price, I am confident I will get many years use from it as long as I treat it right and store properly.

"I never use anything plastic in my kitchen involves heat, because of the fear that chemicals can leach through, even a colander. With that being said, it is hard to find a good one that works fast and properly. I have used mesh and several different stainless steel that have all turned out to be junk. The mesh ones are just a joke, the first time using them I dented them and they lost their shape fast. So my next one was from the local Walmart, but it didn't have quite enough holes and would be so slow for draining. The bottom blocked the sink drain and when rinsing a food, the water would actually rise up and start getting into the foods, so it's just been a pain to try and find a good one. I have to say, I was a bit skeptical with this one to. I was worried about how good the steel would be. However, I was way wrong. First off, the steel is nice and a bit thick, it will not dent and I can actually stack in to some of my larger kettles and bigger bowls. I am not concerned that the steel will get dented up or loose shape. I can also run it in the dishwasher without getting damaged.Handles actually have a rubber end and has a good grip.The colander is very wide at top and the entire shape has drain holes and drains extra fast. It does have a good bottom but it doesn't block off the sink drain, it does cover it but the water still flows out and without stopping it from blocking it.Something else, I have noticed with some of the other stainless steel colanders, when the entire colander had drain holes entirely is they would have sharp edges on the outside and on the inside. I was constantly getting scratched up with them and getting cut. However, the KUKPO, has a smooth edge, there is no sharp pieces sticking out anywhere, it's smooth and solid.The KUKPO Colander is the best one, hands down. It's made well and I don't see why it wouldn't last a life time and sure beats using plastic or any mesh colanders, I have ever used. I will keep my old one as a back up, during big dinners like at Christmas time, but the KUKPO will always be my go-to. It is a must have for anyone in the market, looking for a stainless steal colander.I've also included pictures of my old colander next to the KUKPO, to show how it makes a difference in having the entire shape with drain holes.I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19E90YXJ4JOTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RDFKBK#wasThisHelpful","R19E90YXJ4JOTV","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a bit scared the first time I switched to Candyseason Trash Bags. I only used name brand, even though I was not 100% satisfied with them, I had nothing but horrible experiences with any cheap bag. Well not be scared here, these are not cheap bags. In fact, they are better than any name brand trash bag I have ever used and will never change. They do look a little thin, but don't let that fool you, these bags are stretchy and strong. They will hold weight without any leaks. I'm just so impressed that they do not leak. They don't even bubble or make a ripple. Weight don't bother them and a 10 gallon bag can get pretty heavy.They actually stick to the rim of my can, without sliding in. Which was always a battle for me with any other bags, I used.Come in 4 handy rolls, so you can place in other rooms or the garage.In the long run, Candyseason will save you a good chuck of change.

"I have always been a fan of name brand trash bags, even though I was not 100% happy, I stuck to a brand I knew worked best for me. With that being said, I am so happy to have tried Candyseason, I'll never switch back or use another brand. There is so many reasons they are better than any other brand. At first glance they do seem to be kind of thin, but they have a good stretch and good feel to the bag, not something cheap. Well, these bags will not rip. I mean they won't even bubble or ripple. They also stay on the rim of the can, which I always had problems with others sliding down in the can and constantly digging it out. When they stretch over the can, the only time they will come off is when you physically take them off.They can sure hold weight without any leaks or the bags breaking when I am transferring to the large outside, I have never had a spill. I never was one to get excited about a trash bag, but these have sure got me impressed. Normally I have a problem with the lid on my kitchen can breaking through the bag as it is a dual swing lid, however it doesn't effect the Candyseason Line.They are not drawstring and this brand doesn't need to be, you can leave a little room at top to tie them.They come in 4 handy rolls, great if you want to put a roll in the garage or somewhere else.By far the best bags I have ever used and is a must have for anyone in the market.

"The space saver bags, have been around for ages, I am a first time user of this brand. Honestly, I always thought they was just a gimmick and never bothered to try them out. Well, I have been a fool for a very long time, now! They do work and they do save a lot of space.The Townpeak Space Saver Bags, come with 3, each are different sizes. However, mine did not come with any instructions.. which lead me back here. The instructions on the listing was a little hard for me to follow, maybe cause I am a newb.. I ended up following some of the reviews here, the ones with photo's that showed each step. Also I had one of the caps missing from my package as it only came with 2. So far, I have only used 2 of the bags, but I would have liked to use the other one later on if needed.. maybe I can tape it up, we shall seen at that point.Here is what I found.They were easy to use with proper instructions.Liked the different sizes, you could fit a quilt in them if you needed (the larger one)Vacuumed out all the air.Once vacced out, the package doesn't lay flat, but qurinkley with the items.Bags was easy to zip lock, with provided closure.They seem to be made of a good material.Air does not get in.Saves space.My space is limited in my home and kids are growing and we just have nothing. I am a pack rat as it is. When we have clothes that no longer fit or for different seasons, I usually take them in the garage and put them in boxes, my husband hates when I do this. Also I have boxes under the bed filled with clothes and that is something I hate doing is putting anything under there. I was able to take everything out of it and put in 2 bags. They will really leave a lot. You do need to leave a few centimeters for zipping. I do not know long time use. Right now, when I released the air, nothing was wrinkled.. but I suppose over time it would wrinkle as the way it lays.I would make a few suggestions to the merchant, first would be to put instructions in there for everyone. It would have been much easier, instead of getting on the laptop and looking for directions. Also, maybe it was just mine, but I was missing one of the caps. Mine was actually sealed with 2, one zipper closure (which is all that is needed) but I did see some reviewers said they had 3. After that I would have gladly giving 5 stars.Would I recommend?In a heart beat.. these bags have knocked out all the boxes under my bed and I actually had to go looking for other items to continuing filling only 2 of them. If you are looking to save space, these are the trick. I wish I had tried them all those years ago, I think it would have saved me a whole lot of work over the years.Tip, I am using chalkboard labels to identify what is in each bag. They are wide and I can write out everything on them for different seasons. But you can use masking tape anything, this really will help come next spring.I received this product free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29LYXM0YSOLV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ULPCVM#wasThisHelpful","R29LYXM0YSOLV0","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This rug is quality made and such a gorgeous design, it is so much more than I expected. For starters, it's a bit brighter in color, the stock photo does look a bit dull. Which is fine with me, I am thrilled it's a bit brighter. Color is so vivid and lots of detail going on in the roses and in the leafs. This rug is such an amazing touch to any room.The rose rug, by HugHapy is far from being thin. In fact, it has a bit of a thickness. Material is more than average and especially craftsmanship. No loose pieces or anything out of place, not a flaw to be seen. When I first got the rug, it was folded. Yes that is a bit scary at first and you will be thinking, ""will the folds come out"". Don't be frighted by the fold, after laying flat for less than a day, the fold in the middle will be gone. Now the leafs did turn, at the end and kind of curl under, they will need a few days for them to be ""straight"".A major deal breaker for me when purchasing rugs, is the backs. I am not looking for something that slides everywhere. I have tile and hardwood throughout my house, so rugs are extra important to me. I certainly won't use one if they just slide all the time and it becomes a hassle to even use them anymore. However the rose rug has a non-slip back. It does work like a charm on the hardwood in my home, it does slid a little in the kitchen, but is always a bit slippery in there, so that could be why. Even still that is not a deal breaker. I wanted it for my room, but it was just so lovely and matched my daughters bedroom suite and colors, I put it in her room. She has a pink/princess themed room and it makes a gorgeous pop. One is not enough! They will become addictive, I can already see that.. I want one for every room!Comfy! Standing on the rug is so nice on the feet and comfortable.This rug is just amazing and is true to size, described. So much details in the rose and leafs, with different colors in both.

"These skinny jeans, are da bomb! Boy, Moonwalk can sure make a good pair of jeans.. going on my second pair of jeans from this brand and couldn't be more pleased. They are priced reasonably, without breaking the bank. Far from being average, they are a top quality jean. I would have thought they would cost more like fifty. So don't be fooled by the price, this is an awesome pair of skinny jeans. It's hard to find a nice pair of skinny jeans without looking like I'm wearing a pair of ballerina pants. Most of the time I am stuck buying women's skinny jeans, yes it's true and I am embarrassed to admit that.. But they sure don't fit right, below the belt. These jeans are far from being anything like a woman's jeans and made for a man. They ride ""low"" and built for us. They are tight, yeh.. but they are not skin tight, that looks like ballerina legs.The biker style look is just awesome, with the washed, distressed look. The ridges are really neat and that makes them different from any other pair I own. Besides the fact that the material is above average, I also can't get over the fact that I can move my legs around with no restrictions and the fact that they are pretty soft.Button is reinforced, it's staying. Fly works with ease, no snagging.Stitching is neat and piped strong and above average.Fit is right on the money, true to size. Order what you would normally wear.A man still needs pockets space, even if you are wearing skinny jeans. Front pockets in these are deep and hold my Samsung Galaxy S5. Back pockets aren't the deepest, but hey they hold my wallet and that is all I need them for.Belt loops are wide enough for a common sized belt, nothing extra wide but something normal.Lots of detail going on here, the biker effect is pretty awesome and unique, don't see anyone hardly with this type of skinny jean.Couldn't be any happier with the look, fit, quality and craftsmanship, if you're a man and into the skinny jean look, the ""biker effect"", skinny jeans are must have.I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OSIRXRCUN4QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142BA0DE#wasThisHelpful","R1OSIRXRCUN4QG","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to find little pieces like this that fit and flatter, this one does without a doubt. I am about 170 and 5'9 with a cup size of 34C. The material is stretchy, I can see how it would fit different sizes. It sure is a beauty and has a lot going on. I love how this item comes packaged, it comes in a beautiful gift box with the Mrs Demon logo on top, as soon as you see it, you know something is darn good inside. Really appreciate the fact it comes packaged so nicely and would be a great little gift for any lady.Material is above average and crafted without a flaw. Material is soft and velvety, very thin mesh like (see through). It's so not delicate and itchy on the skin. This is one piece that is more than top notch as far as quality and design. Feels good on the skin, no complaints.As far as appearance, it's certainly a flattering piece. I just love it. Lots of little details, cleavage, the whole 9 yards! The breast area has a nice cut, and has a lacey like top, in a cute flower design, that's very attractive. There is this long belt like that is at the center, you can tie it in to a bow or let it drape, either way it's appealing. The bottom has a ribbon like finish, that I just adore and gives it a sway if you are up walking. Also, the straps are adjustable, which is very important to me.For care, I washed in cold water in a lingerie bag and let it hang to dry, which doesn't take long to dry. I never dry any item like this. Anywhoo, it held up just fine in the washer, no change of shape, nor did it rip or any damages.Panties are just adorable and on point with the design. They are not thongs and not granny panties! They are cute and see through with a drape hanging on the top with some cute little bows on the side. Fit was great.I am more than happy with this set, it's everything I am looking for in a lingerie piece, fit and flattering, what more could you want! It's a must have for anyone looking for sexy, without getting to skimpy.I received this product free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GRRQCW9UPWWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QWSHH0#wasThisHelpful","R2GRRQCW9UPWWD","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I worked in Security for around 5 years before transferring to IT Fieldwork. With that being said, I have seen a huge variety if security cameras and know a good one when I see one. Raynic SmartCam is an amazing little gadget and I am blown away by the features and price. My old boss sold analogs for 600 dollars and to this day he still gets that much out of them and that's not even including 99 dollars an hour for installation, running wires and all that can really add up. At that time, I thought his camera systems were marked at a good price, he sold IP cameras for about 1000 or more. Turns out I was fooled for a very long time, I had no idea you could get one just as good on Amazon for only a fraction of the cost. Raynic has a very low cost camera, but don't be scared by the low price. This IP Camera has great quality images. It's not even comparable to my analogs and the thing is you don't need an expensive DVR System to watch it from. This camera runs off an app, you can view it anywhere from your smartphone. My analogs does not allow that, I can view them from a laptop but it has to be live feed.Just like the description, it's pretty much plug and play. There is no installation, running wires, makes holes in the house, going through the attics making sure no wires are seen.. these take the cake by far. There is a little bit of networking to do and you don't need to have a Computer Science degree to hook it up, its easy as pie.This device is small and really not much bigger than the palm of my hand. It is made for the inside, but it would be great if you are looking to protect your business or home. It would certainly make a face, if there was someone who broke into your home. Heck I even place mine in the window during the day, because I have a neighbor that gets kind of wild we have to watch our for, the glass doesn't really bother the IRs to badly in sun, but the glass would hurt the image at night, which is expected.Has a decent image as far as night vision and picks up 26ft.Besides the fact that this camera has an amazing image, it also has Two Way Audio. The camera has a built in mic and speaker that allows you to actually communicate through it, using the app. Using the controls on the app were pretty easy to function and it works great without freezes and bugs. When my old boss at the local security company was selling a two way audio IP camera, those would start at around 1200 bucks, when he probably was ordering them major cheap right here on Amazon and reselling them for hundreds of dollars. Pretty smart!This camera has everything you could want as far as security camera, but even more, this is what I would want as far as having a nursery too, they are way way cheaper than going out and buying an expensive baby monitor, when this one does everything and then some. What I can't get over is the super low price.. I mean yeh I have seen some cheap ones, but Raynics, is extra cheap, especially for all the features. I don't know how they can sell one like this so cheap, my ex boss would have easily sold this type for hundreds of dollars. I am blown away. I would recommend.

"Back in the day, leg warmers used to be the ""thing"", according to my mother! She couldn't believe they had came back in style. Anyways, I didn't think she would have known what they were! Well these are awesome! Yes, I am looking for a stylish leg warmer and obviously I want them to keep my legs warm too. In the winter when I am sitting at my desk, it gets pretty drafty and cold under there and I need something extra to stay warm. These are perfect to stay warm and to make a fashion statement. They are like little sweaters, for your legs!I am 5'9 and average weight, about 170, I have normal size legs, not skinny minny but not overly large and find they, fit perfectly, would be great for different sizes. They hug the area without riding down and look good on.Looks good under skinny jeans and over any height boots.As far as comfort and wearing them against your legs, the material isn't the softest, but it's nothing that is scratchy. So it's nothing that is going to cause you to itch.

"Holy Moly, I am super excited about this cardigan! I am a huge fan of cardigans and have a ton of them, but honestly this has to be my new favorite hands down. It's amazing. I have to say, I didn't know how I was going to like the patchwork on the elbows, but, turns out.. they are pretty awesome and really stands out from others. The color is a little different from what the model in the photos are wearing, it was a bit more dull, but the actual product is just like the photo's. It's actually black with white stripes, and that is what I expected.I am always scared of ordering online, I am usually the girl that has to try something on in stores, but there isn't much to choose from locally and I always want something that is different from everyone. Look no further, this is one that will stand out and fits like a glove. As far as sizing, I ordered an extra large, for cardigan. I like for those to be a bit loose. Well, the size is pretty accurate, at least for me. It is a bit loose, some do seem a little bigger, I am satisfied with fit, no complaints.Material is above average and crafted well. It's a bit stretchy, material is soft, stitching is nice and neat, everything is top notch. Sleeves hang lower than the wrist, just like the picture. Now, it is a thin material and not something that is going to keep you warm in snow weather. It is great for windy, cool days or worn under your jacket. It's also nice to have to wear around the home.I could see this lasting a bit, just take care of it and it. Wash in like colors and hang to dry. I am confident it will last many seasons.Goes with skinny jeans, blue jeans and lots of styles and colors. I will probably wear something light underneath and even blacks, even pinks! I just think that something solid would be best. A long necklace, with this and knee boots, oh my this is my favorite look.I knew I was going to be impressed but not this excited, it's going to be hard to find another that will top this one. The stripes, material and patchwork are just amazing, it's way better than I expected and is a must have for any girl looking for a cute cardigan. The price is reasonable and the quality is even better.. I recommend!I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23CO1SOZ2S37R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XMEKC8#wasThisHelpful","R23CO1SOZ2S37R","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now this shirt is pretty hot in the picture, but let me tell ya, it looks even hotter in person! It is now one of my top picks! It was a tough decision to make, but I finally went with the leopard print, there's only one problem.. one is not enough! Just seeing this one, I want all the other selections too! I have been a die hard fan of all things animal print though and my home is covered with this print! But still it is really a must have for any fashionista.First up, fit.. I am always hesitant of any clothing found online. I am usually the girl that has to try everything on first, to see how it fits. No need to be scared here, the fit is perfect, I have no complaints. Although the sizing is a little different, I ordered a 12 and was unsure what it would be, the tag says it's large which is what I was needing. Order what you would normally get in shirt size.Looks... this shirt is everything the picture shows. The material is above average. Surely not what I was expecting for something that is marked as low as this. It has like a soft, stretchy like material, the sleeves are like a silk and are kindly see through. Such an appealing shirt and looks good for any age group. The wrist's also have cuff's, like. This is great it keeps the sleeves from riding up and stays where it's supposed to. Neckline is average cut, it does stick with the design, happy by the cut.Stitching is neat and no loose threading. It seems to be crafted well and made to last, for a good amount of time. As far as cleaning, I have only washed in cold water with like colors as I would anything, but I would not dry, I would think that lint would stick to the material. If you made sure not to wash with towels and such it would probably be okay. I just prefer to line dry. I do that with many of my clothes as it is.I couldn't be any happier with this shirt. It is certainly one that gets compliments, anywhere I go and actually from ladies of different age groups. There isn't many people that wear these types of prints, so it is one that would stand out. There is no limit on what you can wear with it.. I do different styles.. sometimes brown boots, with white skinny jeans, any kind of jean and any color will work. There is not limit. Don't be fooled by the low price, It's definitely a fashion piece and one that is a must have for every girls closet.

"This vibe is way different, than any I have seen.. for starters, it has a jelly like feel, but that is not all.

"I am young and always looking for a cute bra.. but for nursing bra's there isn't a big selection and one has to go with a ""granny bra"". However, the HOVEOX Nursing Bra is not a ""granny bra""! It's super cute and is actually something I could get by wearing daily. Lots of detail, polka-dot, lace on the at the top of the folds, and wide straps. Amazingly comfy! This is a big thing for me, new mommies need extra softness, since the breast gets so sore, a wired bra does not help, which this bra does not have any wires. I don't have huge knockers, but average.. that being said.. it does give me support.Also included, is clasp extension. Which is a great thought, since a new mom will need the extra extension.To use for nursing, the front will fold down. Then the middle has small sized inserts in the nipple area to over leak protection.This bra is awesome for a nursing mom or even if you don't plan on nursing... it's super soft and great for soreness. I would totally use it everyday.

"While cooking, I never use the counter to sit my utensils, especially when making meats and such. This can transfer any diseases to the counters. I have special trays and such to sit them in, but the germs still get there, which I may forget to bleach them that night if there isn't enough dishes to put in the dishwasher. I always keep a stack of foam plates for this very reason, yes some think I am weird.. but that is just how I am. These cooking utensils are an absolute life save for me, for that very reason. Never, will there be any germs or diseases transferring to my counters as long as the are sitting right. Not only that, but some foods that get on the counter tops are hard to remove, if they dry.Material- handles are soft silicone, feels good in the hand and non slip. The ends are of a sturdy hard plastic. Seems to be something that would last a long time, but could break, that would just depend on how you handle them. You would have to be pretty hard on them, I would think to break one. I don't use them in my ceramic pans, cause I only use silicone. But they are wonderful for anything else. Something else that has really got me impressed is the fact that the materials is free form any harsh chemicals, BPA being one. When this chemical gets high temps, the chemical can transfer and cause bad health issues. I always steer clear of BPA, even in water bottles.Set is attractive and matches my pans nicely.All the utensils in this set, I will always be able to use, where there is some you really just don't need, so not the case here.The soup ladle is really my favorite, it has a point to transfer liquids easier and without splashing. Several have holes and such and are great for noodles and use them for serving utensils, rather than just cooking only.As far as size, these are not small utensils. In fact they are of a larger size, which is what I am looking for.Lastly, these cooking utensils are dishwasher safe. I run them in the top rack, since they are a bit bigger in size for bottom, no damage to them and still look as good as new. Being dishwasher safe is extra important to me, since I have been spoiled by one and hate washing by hand!Nice set and happy to recommend.I received this product free, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B4040PWDTU7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119A4BQI#wasThisHelpful","R1B4040PWDTU7U","AR294VEC122KU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR294VEC122KU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to shop local for belts, but, there wasn't much of a selection for men's at a handful of stores, plus the fact that I only wanted leather. Every time I buy a belt local, they bend, break and the material starts peeling off right after I get them, in less than a month. With that being said, I don't think I will have that issue with this belt, not only that it's just a genius idea. I love the fact that I can cut the belt and customize it to my own size. I don't think I will ever own another ""common"" belt. These are certainly the way to go.So the fit is down, how bout the materials. Well, for starters it has a above average leather, it's not thin but not thick. I honestly don't think I will have any issues for short time use and I am confident that I will actually be able to get a long time use from it. At this point, I have not seen any wear and tear, which is very impressive.The Gunmetal buckle, is way cool. I am really digging this buckle. I did notice that this seller had ton's of other varieties in buckles to choose from. Which is the only problem I have noticed, one belt is not enough! I would certainly like to have more buckles and a black belt, as I am sure most will agree.As far as the latching system, it's easy to work, but it will also stay buckled, with out coming undone. Has a good strong latch. To unhook, there is a latch under the buckle and the bottom on the right hand side, just push that and the belt will easily release.I wear this belt for daily wear and for work. I work in the IT Field and required to dress up, no sneakers.. shirt tucked in.. you get the picture. This belt fits the bill for a more formal affair. My shirt tucked in.. the belt looks really nice on and does the job.I couldn't have asked anything more for a belt, it's incredible.

"Finding a good fingertip/face towel is a challenge, especially if you are looking online. You don't know what you are getting into. With that being said, I wanted something soft/plush, a towel that doesn't scratch or irritate my hands/face. It's safe to say that the Velour Fingertip Towels by Creative Scents is everything I was looking for and then some. This set is a luxury set and is amazingly soft and has a bit of thickness/fluffiness to them, being absorbent and soft on the touch.As far as quality - they are above average and with a nice embroidery edge. They are more than a hotel towel, that is for sure.The issue I have with towels is when I wash and dry them, they start shrinking, loosing their shape and the threading frays. However, that is not the case here, what so ever. I have washed and dried this set about 5 times now. There wasn't a single loose thread, they did not loose their shape, nor did the shrink. Even at the embroidery, I see a lot of towels close in right there only, these did not. The edges are reinforced and so they will not unravel. I am confident in them as long term use.Another poster said they were too small. They are exactly the size listed. These are not long hand towels, hence the title ""fingertip"".These towels are so much better than what you can pick up at the local Walmart. They are a luxurious set, absorbent and fast drying. Even makes a great decoration towel.

"The Life-Form Positioning Device is a pretty handy piece. The spider look is just awesome and looks so cool, will really have people talking about it. But there is tons of uses for it, I am finding something to use it will more and more. I first intending on using it to film small products, on the table, that I may be showing on YouTube, but it also works to film you since it will stand. That's not all, it works amazing using on the cabinets, while trying to cook and follow a recipe. We even tried it out on a tree and on my, that was pretty wicked! I have even used it on the ceiling, where allowed and that was wonderful!Now this is not a cheap device.. in fact is has a solid build and is better than average. Certainly a lot better than I would have imagined. The spider legs is just a genious idea. It really clamps on to different surfaces will not fall down. All the legs bend to different positions and getting lots of different angles.Fits many different sized devices, from tablets to cameras. But something that has really got me impressed is the fact that it will even hold my sports camera.. You don't have to go out and hunt for 50 different accessories, when this device will probably do even more than you wanted it to. Not only does it work with my sports camera, but my 10"" & 7"" and even my 5"" phone work with it.If you just want to use it as a tablet/phone stand.. it beats any other tablet stand I have ever used and by far. I can also get it to sit higher than an common stand.Some of the tablets and such can get pretty heavy, but, that doesn't effect the stability of the unit. Using it with 3 arms or what not it still stands and does not lean over or even flip.I am using this device so much more than my original intent, like i said, you can use it for anything you could possibly think of. If you are in the market, I suggest to get it, without any second thoughts.

"I'm not one of those hard core campers, but I do like to camp one or two nights a few times a year. I've been using those foam, egg crate style sleeping pads, and have been in absolute misery.  I find it so uncomfortable, and I've looked into different options, such as a fold out cot or an air mattress. Well, the last thing I want when camping is bulkier equipment to pack up. That's what made this limit air pad appealing to me. You blow it up (4 breaths for the pillow, and 11 breaths for the body), and it really is effective. It keeps me off the ground without ""bottoming out"" on the ground.

"I'm 5'2"", as such, I'm no stranger to stepping stools. I have a nice wooden one that I keep out 24/7 in the kitchen to reach things in cabinets. I was looking for another stool to keep in a closet on the other floors of my house. I liked that this folds up for storage. I find the folding mechanism easy to use, and it snaps securely when it's opened up. I like the non-slip rubber texture on the top too.

"I've had what I believe to be the precious model of Bose noise cancelling headphones for a year now, and then ordered this pair for my husband. We travel/fly multiple times a year for leisure, and noise cancelling headphones are indispensable. They will not block out all noise, they block out ambient background noise (the roar of an airplane), but not sudden sounds like a baby crying. But because these block out background noise, you can listen to your music or videos better, and with the volume turned down lower, a saving your hearing. For those who don't know, the noise cancelling feature is independent from the headphones. So, you don't need to be listening to anything in order to use it. And it does need a AA battery to operate the noise cancelling feature.

"I've purchased goji berries before, and wasn't really liking the taste that much. The ones I had gotten were excessively chewy and had a weird after taste. I reluctantly decided to try this brand just to see if the taste could be any better. People describing these as ""plump"" and ""juicy"" really sold it for me. Well, these are definitely better tasting, but I wouldn't describe them as necessarily plump or juicy. They're a little bigger than the standard ones I've seen in stores, and still chewy, but not as chewy as the other ones I had. These were clearly not as dehydrated. I do like the taste of these better, but they're not dramatically different. So if you tried goji berries before and hated them, you probably won't like these either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IRIF3WI5AGVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWW3LQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3IRIF3WI5AGVO","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a small, round dining table meant to seat four. Because of the size and shape of the table, I prefer round placemats. These are exactly what I was looking for. They're a woven type of material that seems sturdy and well made. They wipe down easy and appear stain resistant, which is also nice. I don't think I'd want to risk putting these in the washing machine, but like I said they're pretty easy to clean just by wiping down. I'm also loving this sunny yellow gold color.

"I'm what you'd most likely refer to as a ""crazy cat lady"". Basically I want to do as much as I possibly can for my cats and keep them happy. I have two hard plastic cat carriers already, but this soft mesh one intrigued me. Well, after receiving it, I'm definitely impresses with it. I got the large, which is the same size as my other carriers. I wouldn't recommend getting any smaller unless you're wanting it for a guinea pig or something. Here's what makes this soft carrier better than my plastic ones: It's significantly lighter weight, and I suspect more comfortable for kitty. The soft padding inside can be removed and wash. The biggest advantage is the top unzips so that you can just lower the cat into it and then zip it closes.

The cookie sheet has a 'pebbled', textured surface to make it nonstick without needing any kind of nonstick coating. I was skeptical and did do a light spray of oil before baking some cookies. Well, the cookies did release immediately, and I'll probably try using no spray next time. I would consider this cookie sheet ""jumbo"" sized, it's definitely the biggest one I've ever owned.

"There's a couple qualities I look for in a good water bottle: BPA free, easy to clean, easy to drink from, doesn't drip, and not a huge size. Some fancy water bottles I've had, have tons of silicone seals and opening/closing mechanisms that fill with grime and are hard to get clean. This one is very simple, just push the button and the top opens, despite how simple it is, it doesn't leak. It's also easy to fill because when you unscrew the lid, the opening is as wide as the bottle. This is exactly the same as their ""adult"" version, except not as big, 17 oz.

"This product touts itself as a replacement for Botox, ""needles no more"", and makes some pretty bold claims of ""instantly relaxes lines"". I do get botox, and not even botox works ""instantly"" (takes about a week to set in). The thing with Botox, is that around 3 months it starts to wear off, and I schedule my appointments at about 5 months out. So I'm always looking for skin care products that might help stretch out the results or even improve the results. That said, I noticed absolutely nothing from this product. I'm not even sure, reading the ingredients, what in it would be at all effective. It has some moisturizing qualities, and also some acid peel type ingredients. That said, I already moisturize and do acid peels, so this product isn't going to magically transform my skin. The price of this is around $90 for 0.5 oz and will last you maybe 2 months. I pay $250 for Botox every 5 months.

"I had heard about 'bulletproof coffee', that somehow adding an oil to my morning coffee would help me lose weight? Sure, I'll try just about anything. Well, the thought of putting oil in my coffee sounded kind of disgusting to be honest, but in reality you can't even taste the oil at all, so it makes no difference. I've been doing one tablespoon a day for a couple weeks now. I was not sure how this mct oil might affect me, I didn't notice any stomach upset or other side effects. What I did notice, was a very diminished appetite. I've been trying to count calories for awhile now, but because I'd get too hungry, I'd end up cheating and not losing any weight. Well, since I've added this oil to my daily coffee, I've lost 5 lbs because I've been able to stick to my calorie goals or even be under my daily goals and not be hungry.However, I did take a star off for the leaky bottle. When the bottle arrived roughly 2 oz of it had leaked all over the cardboard box and the box was just saturated with oil. I cleaned the oil off the product, but everytime I use it, some oil leaks down the side of the bottle. So, I really love the oil and will continue using it, but I'll have to use a different brand because it's just ridiculous how leaky the bottle is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9IT06WKWH2IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGW5UVY#wasThisHelpful","R9IT06WKWH2IR","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's replacing a much larger cookie-press style one I had that required two hands to use, took up a lot if space, and was horrible to clean. With this oxo one, I can hold and dispense with one hand. This is very compact too, only holds about one cup. Obviously you'll have to fill it again half way through decorating, but it's very easy to fill and worth it for the small size. The metal decorating tips are universally sized, so the ones I already had fit this too. I'm storing the tips inside the body of it. It completely comes apart to clean.

"The claims that this product makes are pretty dramatic claims, stating "" relax the appearance of muscle tightening"" and ""45% reduction in the appearance of wrinkles in 8 weeks"". After a month of using this product, I will say that it is very moisturizing, and I like it for that, but that's a lot of money for a good moisturizer when I didn't notice anything as far as relaxing the muscles on my face or reducing wrinkles. I'm in my 30's, and I use Botox to smooth out the lines I've already got and also to prevent them from getting worse. There's a lot of skincare products out there targeting women who are fearful or against trying something like Botox. The claims that this product make, give me the impression that it's trying to be an alternative to Botox, although it does not state that directly. Well, I pushed my next Botox appointment a month out and gave this product a try in the meantime in order to really give it a chance. I love the way the product dispenses, and a little goes a long way. It appears that this product will last somewhere between 2 and 3 months. It is moisturizing and a nice cream for nighttime. After looking at the ingredients, the key ingredient in this cream is Squalene, which is derived from olives, high moisturizing and plumps up wrinkles to reduce their appearance. I don't particularly care for some of the other chemical ingredients in this product, like butylene glycol. The description proudly proclaims it is ""paraben free"", but people who care about avoiding parabens generally want to avoid glycols as well. So, definitely not a natural product. The price is also pretty outrageous for what it is. You are basically paying for a fancy container. If you want to try the moisturizing benefits of squalene you can search for it on Amazon and find more natural options for $10.  In conclusion, this is a nice cream in a nice package, but too many ingredients I don't care for, way overpriced, and definitely not effective enough to make me give up Botox.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CG1ABLZBKQ46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHXE948#wasThisHelpful","R2CG1ABLZBKQ46","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have persistent adult acne (meaning I've had acne since I was a teenager, and am now in my 30's). I've gotten it mostly under control by supplementing with zinc and also a pretty complicated system of cleansing and treating. I actually make my own cold cream using evening primrose oil, sulfur and tea tree oil, then tone with witchhazel and spot treat with 10% ichthammol ointment when needed. Although my system works, if I could have something easier, especially when traveling, that would be perfect.I read online about this Benzac system before ordering. I read a press release online where the company described the product as ""vegan"" and ""natural"". This appealed to me, and I liked that the product uses essential oils  and no benzoyl peroxide (I hate that stuff). When the box arrived, I was dissappointed to read the ingredient list, it has glycols and parabens in it, which I wouldn't consider ""natural"". And although it doesn't contain any animal derived ingredients (as far as I can tell), the company does test on animals, so that's not exactly ""vegan"" either. Although I would never order this product again for these reasons, since I had it, I decided to try it out.+First impressions, I liked the foaming cleanser. It uses a foaming pump to make it foam, the actual cleanser is not detergenty or sudsy, which is good as soaps tend to aggravate acne. The cleanser did successfully remove my makeup, and quite easily it seems, although I did not use it around my eyes for obvious reasons.+The moisturizer that comes with it has no SPF in it, which is a no-no for me, I will not use a moisturizer during the day with no SPF. I've been using Murad Anti-Aging Moisturizer for blemish-prone skin SPF 20. But I figured I'd just use the Benzac Moisturizer at night so as not to waste it.+When I first used the spot treatment, I was surprised to squeeze the tube and find that it's half empty, then when you finally got some product out, it comes rushing out as the opening is too big. I'll also add that it pills up when applying makeup over top of it. Not a huge fan of this.In the end I used this system for about a week and then had to stop because it was drying out my skin so bad. The only thing worse then having a pimple is having a pimple and horribly dry skin. Also, every time I'd use any of the products, my eyes would sting even though I didn't apply near my eyes. I think from the salicylic acid fumes or something. I'll speak for all adult women when I say we aren't fans of dried out skin and moisturizers without SPF in them. I also started to break out a little and I suspected it might be this system, although I can't say for sure. I'm posting the product ingredients below so you can make your own decision about them.Ingredients Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser: alcohol denatured, backhousia citriodora leaf extract, butylene glycol, caprylic/capric triglyceride, citric acid, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, citrus grandis (grapefruit) peel oil, citrus reticulate (tangerine) peel oil, glycerin, glycine soja (soybean) oil,lauramidopropyl betaine, lonicera caprifolium (honeysuckle) flower extract, lonicera japonica (honeysuckle) flower extract, phenoxyethanol, polysorbate 80, potassium benzoate, santalum album (sandalwood) oil, sodium laurylglcosides hydroxypropylsulfonate, terminalia ferdinandiana fruit extract, tocopherol, water.Ingredients Intensive Spot Treatment: alcohol, allium fistulosum bulb extract, backhousia citriodora leaf extract, butylene glycol, butylparaben, cardiospermum halicacabum flower/leaf/vine extract, citric acid, echium plantagineum seed oil, ethylparaben, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) water, helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil unsaponifiables, hydroxypropylcellulose, isobutylparaben, methylparaben, octyldodecanol, phenoxyethanol, potassium benzoate, potassium sorbate, propylparaben, santalum album (sandalwood) oil, SD Alcohol 40-B, tocopherol, water.Ingredients Blemish Clearning Hydrator: alcohol denatured, backhousia citriodora leaf extract, butyl avocadate, butlene glycol, c13-14 isoparaffin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, chlorphenesin, citric acid, glycerin, hydrolyzed algin, isodecyl neopentanoate, laureth-7, lonicera caprifolium (honeysuckle) flower extract, lonicera japonica (honeysuckle) flower extract, methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamine, potassium benzoate, potassium sorbate, proplyene glycol, santalum album (sandalwood) oil, terminalia ferdinandiana fruit extract, water, zinc sulfate.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QYJLKRS3OKOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ON1VGT6#wasThisHelpful","R3QYJLKRS3OKOI","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whenever I try a new mascara, I apply it to only one eye and then apply the mascara I had been using to the other eye and compare. I do this because all mascaras enhance the lashes to a certain extent and it's easy to be dazzled without another mascara to compare it to. So, up for comparison is this Japonesque ""lash loading mascara"" and my number 1 favorite mascara so far: Loreal Miss Manga. Both mascaras are about the same size Japonesque is 0.3oz and Miss Manga is 0.27oz. Japanesque is manufactured in the UK and Miss Manga is manufactured in the USA.Well, after applying one to each eye, there's a huge difference in performance and Miss Manga is by far the winner. Lash thickness appears the same, but Miss Manga makes lashes look a solid 50% longer. I'll also say that the Japonesque brush is horrible and I had to pick two clumps off my lashes. By the end of the day I had blacks black smudge under the eye wearing the Japonesque. I would describe the performance of Japonesque as ""below average"", like something that would be alright if I had bought it at a dollar store.

"For the past year, I had extremely dry skin on my nose that would flake and peel. It was embarassing as it made my nose red as well, and I even had someone joke that I looked like an alcoholic... not the impression I want to give! I tried various solutions and nothing seemed to work. I started to suspect that I had seborrheic dermatitis which apparently can only be managed with no permanent solution. I had various, expensive, very heavy and greasy creams recommended to me to use, which seemed to help some, but not completely.I saw this product in the 'natural section' of my base's commissary and since the price was good and I had nothing to lose, I gave it a try. I was surprised by how light weight and quick absorbing this cream is, especially compared to the thick heavy creams I had been using. I put a big glob on my nose and didn't rub it in at all and it fully absorbed. Each time this happened I added more, about 4 times before I went to bed that night just to really give it my all. I will say that that first night of using it, it did sting a little each time I applied it. The next morning I was amazed when my nose did not look flaky at all! I was completely shocked that this product seemed to 'work overnight'. I continued to apply the cream morning and evening and after a couple days I was dismayed to see some flaking return. However, this time was different, over the next week, thick pieces of skin began to peel off my nose, revealing healthy, normal skin underneith.I have been using this cream for two months now and I am happy to say that the skin on my nose now looks completely normal, soft, smooth, flake free, not red at all. I plan on continuing to use this cream as I don't want the condition to return, but as this is a large 4oz jar and I only need a little for my nose, I think this jar will probably last me a very long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R394DC37ZR88ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FLGU30#wasThisHelpful","R394DC37ZR88ND","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a collection of short (1-2 page) articles about the ingredients in food and consumer products. The  fact that the articles are so short, yet interesting makes this book great for an office break room, coffee table, or dare I say a bathroom. The author doesn't pass any judgement on the products or ingredients, just lays it out for the reader to make their own decision. Sometimes more interesting than the ingredients is the backstory behind each article when the author discusses the various roadblocks and backpedaling done by the companies he contacts fir research.I'll add that we live in a time where more people are interested in what they're putting in and on their bodies. I'm definitely one of those people trying to live a more natural life. The past 50 years or so, the products in this book were viewed as 'the miracle of science' and an advancement to society.

"I used to jump on a mini-trampoline maybe an hour a day about 10 years ago and loved it, but eventually the strap connected to the spring snapped and I went crashing to the ground. As a result of that frightening experience, I was hesitant to buy another despite how much I enjoyed it. That said, I recently bought this one because the reviews were good and the price was cheap enough that if it broke I figured it was no big deal. I was once again enjoying having a mini trampoline and jumping about 30 minutes a day, maybe 5 times a week. I'm about 100 pounds under their max weight limit. Well, sure enough, today, after owning this for less then 2 months, I heard a loud bang while jumping on it and discovered one of the springs on the floor. The actual metal of the spring had cracked in half. Looking at the reviews again, I see many 'user submitted photos' of broken springs similiar to what happened to mine. Luckily, there's enough springs on this that I didn't crash to the floor as my previous experience, but it's clear they need to get more sturdy springs for these.

"I have not completed the program yet, but will update as I go.This book is essentially 3 detoxes meant to help dieters get through plateaus and also to optimize health. The author advises you choose which plan based on either your weight loss goals, how much time you have, or which health issues you want to work on. I decided I'd probably try all three. I'll also add that the plans all look appropriate for vegans, vegeterian and people avoiding gluten or other food allergies. It is, however, not low carb as its a lot of fruits and vegetables. Each plan has you start the day with a smoothie and then two bowls of soup, three glasses of a special tea, and of course lunch and dinner.The three day I-Burn is supposed to target inflamation and water retention in the body, and help you lose up to 3lbs. I found Pomroys writings very inspirational, but even still I felt overwhelmed just writing the grocery list. There is an enormous amount of produce to be purchased, from the common (celery) to the unusual (daikon). I ended up paying $96 in groceries for 3 days worth of food! After starting the plan, I realize a lot is waste as she has you make twice as much of the ""burn soup"" for no apparent reason. I will say that after completing day 1, I'm not sure how I feel about it. The food is not very satisfying, but I understand I'm eating for the nutritional properties. It is also very hard going without dairy, bread, sugar, coffee and alcohol!Day 2 of the I-Burn. Feeling very unmotivated, I've gained a pound and my stomach feels bloated and constipated. I decided to blend a cup of coffee into my smoothie to try and get things moving. This is going against the detox, but I don't care at this point. I feel like stopping now, but don't want to waste all that food. I will say that after I was able to go to the bathroom I felt a lot better. I also added more red pepper to the soup to make it more palatable.Day 3 of the I-Burn. I again added a cup of coffee to the smoothie to help with feeling so bloated (I suspect the soup is the cause of this). The pound I gained yesterday is gone and I am back at square one. Weighing in tomorrow will show if I lost any weight at all doing this. I had to work today and this plan is even harder to follow at work. I was rushing to make the smoothie this morning and to get my soup salad and tea packed for the day. I have a lot of food left over that was never ate from this plan, and I am upset that I bought more than I needed following her recommended grocery list. I also have tons of tea and soup left over. I will dump the soup as I can't stomach the thought of eating it ever again.Final verdict. When I weighed myself I lost 2 lbs. Pretty good for three days right? Downside is I felt horrible. I was so bloated I couldn't button my pants even after losing 2lbs! I felt light headed, nauseous, and weak. I think it was maybe an electrolyte imbalance because after I had a sports drink I started feeling better. Despite the weight loss, I would never do this again and returned the book.my recommendation if you still want to try is to only make half the soup and design your own meals based on the allowed foods.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZQSIHH2YFXWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKJHUCG#wasThisHelpful","RZQSIHH2YFXWZ","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Looks horrible. The fabric is also very cheap and clingy, I don't expect it to hold up in the washing machine. So, if you're looking to throw away $5, purchase this tank.

"I've worn mineral makeup for quite a few years now and try and use natural products. I wanted to search for pressed powder as it's not as messy as the loose. This had good reviews so I gave it a try. Well, it's by far the worst makeup I've ever tried. It looks so oily and cakey on my skin. I only used it a couple times and it caused me to break out horribly. My understanding from other reviews is that an older formula used to be better. Maybe that's the reason for so many good reviews? I'm not sure, but I also ordered other Pur Mineral products with this powder and they were all completely awful. Their customer service is horrible too, it took 3 weeks to get a reply to an email and when you call the phone rings and then eventually hangs up, you can't even leave a message. I would advice to avoid this company at all costs. Luckily, I was able to find Tarte cosmetics and love them. I definitely prefer their ""Powderful"" pressed compact better. And of course, you can purchase Tarte on Amazon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VK67PNTTW1E2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007A2Z4VQ#wasThisHelpful","R1VK67PNTTW1E2","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I normally use ecotools brushes, which I've owned about 10 years and have held up wonderfully. Well, i needed a flat top brush like this one for using with pressed powder. My initial feeling on the brush was that it worked well, but sheds like crazy. After washing it, the problems worsened. a black liquid washed off of it. I assumed this was dye from the bristles. Upon drying, the brush would not return to its shape, its now puffy and splayed out. Sorry, but i need a brush that holds up and is better made.

"I'll start by saying that my husband has a GoPro, which he's had about two years now, and so I can't help but compare the two due to them being very similiar, and I'm assuming competitors. They're similiar sizes, but the biggest difference is when you're using the gopro, you have no idea what your camera is aimed at because there's no view screen, so you don't know until you've uploaded it to your computer. The way gopro gets around this, is by taking everything 'wide angled' or 'fish eye' to basically take a large shot of everything. This Action Camera is more of a normal looking video, not so wide lensed. The gopro can also be used to take single photo shots, but again, they are wide angled so they look kind of goofy.Basically, I love that this Action Camera comes with the 'live view remote' and takes regular images. It comes with a case for taking it under water, a car mount, and a couple of extra mounts to attach to anything else you might think of, like a back pack strap, a helmet, etc. Both the Action Camera and the live view Remote use mini usb cables to charge, so no weird chargers needed.The only thing I didn't like is that the manual is not very user friendly. it's just one fold out page, with some pictures and so there was a bit of a learning curve figuring out how to use it. The camera and remote have to sync over bluetooth and that was difficult to get working without clear instructions. But now that I've got it all figured out, I'm pretty excited to take this with me when we go on vacation next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R230LS7ZU8TF58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2KD9KI#wasThisHelpful","R230LS7ZU8TF58","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have naturally wavy, fine textured hair which I straighten daily. Unfortunately, if it rains or is humid, my hair will get super curly, frizzy and just kind of wild. I have tried a lot of 'frizz' products and 'humidity blocking' sprays, and not found any that really work, so I didn't have a lot of hope for this one. Well, it actually works! I've been using it on days when its going to rain/snow, and my hair will only curl slightly at most, and no frizz. Its a pretty drastic improvement.

"I got these because I've been wanting a solution for visible panty lines. These are really great, and are practically invisible under clothes. I like that they weren't too tight, it's very light control. I don't want to fight with my underwear all day!  Also, the leg openings are not hemmed, it's just a straight edge, so there won't be any visible leg bands under your clothes either. What I didn't like is that the legs are a bit long. I'm 5'2"", and they end about mid thigh, so they'd be visible if you wear a short skirt, or even a longer skirt when sitting down. My other complaint is that the waist band rolls down. Maybe it would help if they added some silicone around the waist band. Despite these issues, they're great under form fitting dress pants and smoothes out my figure.

"I've tried a couple different wine preservation systems before and was pleasantly surprised by this. My husband and I drink wine almost everyday, but sometimes don't finish a bottle. Putting the wine in the fridge seems to help but I hate drinking cold red wine or waiting for it to warm up. I was very suspicious of this because surely you can't remove all the air from the bottle without replaving it with something else (like the argon gas systems). That said, it does seem to remove atleast some of the air and create a tight suction.

"I bought one of these at Total Wine after my Metrokane one stopped cutting. At first I really liked this one as the wheels were sharp and new. There are several big problems with this foil cutter though. The steel portion is just a veneer, it is not one solid piece, you can kind of see in the picture the black plastic joint. Well, the veneer would constantly pop off. I glued it multiple times, but it just wouldn't stay. The second major issue is that once it's completely closed, the opening is still too wide for smaller necked bottles and wouldn't cut.

I've tried every natural mascara I know of, around 5 different products, and they all smudge terribly. The mascara would look like black circles under my eyes, which is not the look I want.

"I have to say, I was shocked by how big this is when I got it. I was imagining something around the size of a blender, but its actually about 2 feet tall and a foot wide. Not the dimensions in the description. It says its foor home use, but looks professional. Only fault I saw in it was the manual didn't really say how to put it together or take it apart, but I was able to figure it out. Because of how big it is, storage when not in use may be a pain. I'm thinking of keeping mine ontop of the fridge. The size also makes it too big to really take to someones house for a party.So far I have been using this for frozen alcoholic beverages. Its nice to load it with ingredients and then let the machine do the work for you. I also used it to make ""coffee coolata"" frozen coffee drinks one morning, which was a big hit.

"I pray that your office fridge isn't anything like the one at my work. Stuffed to the gills with forgotten food and not very clean. You clean it one day in a massive effort, and the pigs just make it nasty again. Yuck! My previous lunch back was a brightly patterned vinyl type material, very cute, but could not survive the work fridge. Someone pressed it against the light bulb in the fridge and it melted. It picked up stains from the gross fridge as well. People would smash my bag around and things would spill, the old bag was not leak proof and I would pull it out of the fridge and the bottom would be soaked. Enter this tote: the fabric is like a durable canvas type material I am hoping will take abuse better than my old bag. The inside is a metallic type material meant to lock in heat or cold, be leak proof, and easily rinsed out to clean. Size is pretty standard, not too big or too small.

My table is round, about 50"" in diameter and the square tablecloth looks amazing on it. I really think I will probably buy some of the other prints. The big test for me was what was going to happen after I washed it, and so I waited to review until today. I washed it cold and tumble dry low. I was expecting it to shrink, but it did not shrink one bit! Even better, it wasn't even wrinkled coming out of the dryer, didn't need to iron at all.

"I have a chin length bob, and my hair texture is very fine and naturally kind of wavy. Just about every morning I blow dry my hair with a round brush and then straighten with a flat iron. So, I'm no stranger to heat styling my hair.First off, the description says this is ""4 tools in 1"". More like two tools, a flat iron and a hot brush. I've never used a hot brush like this before, but I have used a curling iron. The problem I always had with a curling iron was my hair is too short and so I would burn myself with it quite frequently. What's nice about using this as a hot brush, is the ""stay cool bristles"" really do stay cool! As I'm styling, I can touch it and it can touch me, and I don't get burned at all. I think it would be pretty difficult to burn yourself with this, which is a nice feature. The problem I always had with flat ironing my hair, is I'd lose volume. Using it as a hot brush, I'm able to just comb it under the hair like a round brush, and it straightens and adds volume.  I have not been successful using it to curl my hair, I think because my hair is just too short.The only issue I have, and the reason why I took a star off, is the lock feature that keeps it closed is not very sturdy. It frequently opens when I'm using it in the hot brush feature. This is annoying and I have to close and lock it again. I'm not sure if the problem is just with mine or a defect with all of them. Overall I do like it though. It heats up fast and I'm hoping it'll last for a long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLJ8WBC8F6KSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOJ9008#wasThisHelpful","RLJ8WBC8F6KSQ","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Obviously they stay on better if you're exercising, but even just sitting or walking around, they feel so much more secure. There's two caveats for why I took a star off. 1) they're a little less comfortable then the old pair I had, as if the look needs to be angled more to wrap around the ear better. 2) it comes with a reinforced cord, which is great, but its atleast a foot shorter than any other headphones I own.

"I took two stars off because I really don't like the ""Autoseal"" feature of this pitcher.  Basically it forms a tight suction with the lid. To take the lid off, you hold down the buttons and pry it off. I'm a woman with small hands and really struggle to take the lid off. The elderly or someone with arthritis doesn't stand a chance. I thought this feature might be of benefit to someone with kids, but no. I turned it upside down, and it leaks terribly through the spout. To contrast, I have a glass bormoli Rocco pitcher I bought from amazon. It has a twist on lid to also form a tight seal, but is easy to remove. I tried turning that one upside down and it did not leak. Of course, the main difference is I got the contigo pitcher for the infused stick.

"This is my second emergency radio. My other one was priced slightly more than this one, but also has features I like better. This particularly one, is a nice compact size, about the length of my hand. It comes with a rechargeable lithium battery, but also a slot for 3 AA batteries. It has a very small solar panel which feeds the lithium battery, However, due to the small size, don't expect that solar panel to do much, and the manual says it will not fully charge the battery.. It also has a crank to charge the lithium battery, or the whole thing can be plugged in to charge. The radio has a flashlight, but it's very dim. The radio itself has a lot of static.

In short, I would probably not recommend this particular model and would advise spending a little bit more for something that works better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAXH5X8ZPMWB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HMREOLK#wasThisHelpful","RAXH5X8ZPMWB3","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start by saying that I like the Ecotools brand. I use their makeup brushes and have had them around 6 years and they still look brand new. So, that said, I was excited to see this brush. I had purchased a paddle brush with bamboo handle by a different company awhile ago and it was a lot more expensive. I needed to replace my old round brush, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. This brush also has the bamboo handle, with recycled plastic body. The barrel is large, but I like that in a round brush (I have chin length hair), I use a wide barrel to build volume. I didn't notice any snagging or tangling with this brush, but I have been styling with a round brush everyday for around 15 years and have short hair. I didn't notice it necessarily drying my hair faster than my old round brush, but the old one was vented too. The fact that the body of the brush is plastic and not metal, I'm hoping will  be less heat damaging. Over all I'm satisfied and are looking forward to more products from Ecotools being released.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QZBHX0RMBEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNAA2J0#wasThisHelpful","R20QZBHX0RMBEI","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use this for work, as I'm out of the office visiting various locations all day. I have a larger organizer, but sometimes I want to have just a few of the essentials and this is good for that. 3 tabs to separate things, and I use the pocket for business cards. I'm not too sure how good it would be for personal travel, as it wouldn't fit in my purse and I wouldn't want to carry it. I took a star off as it seems overpriced. I could buy a portfolio for $14.

"Based on the title of this product, I wrongly assumed this calendar was magnetic and could go the fridge. Instead, the calendar is not magnetic, but comes with two small magnets. The magnets are fairly purposely, because I have no desire to secure something on top of the calendar and be unable to read it. So, I was surprised that I had to attach it with sticky foam pads to the wall. I don't like using that stuff because it's nearly impossible to get it off the wall cleanly.  A solution is to glue some magnets on the back. Other than that, the calendar is fine. It's not very large, so there's not much space. It would be hard to fit more than one appointment on a day, or a detailed note.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0VC75CXVJHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FW6RPEG#wasThisHelpful","R2T0VC75CXVJHM","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been sleeping with a white noise machine going for maybe 15 years and I love them, they really help me sleep to the point that I take it with me when I go on vacation. Prior to this one, I had been using a Marpac brand 'sleep conditioner', which is maybe half the price of this Homedics one and works fine. With this Homedic white noise machine, instead of just one sound, there are multiple, from white noise type sounds to nature sounds, etc. Once you've selected the sound, you can then adjust the volume and tone for even more customization. It has a little remote that comes with it, but half the buttons don't work on it, and the other half of the buttons don't work on the actual device. So, every time I use it, I have to use both the remote and the buttons on it to get what I want. This seems like a big flaw, and other reviews have mentioned buttons that don't work. The other thing about this is that it glows super bright. Like most people who have trouble falling asleep, I'm sensitive to light as well. You can adjust the dimness to turn the glow off, but even completely off the buttons still glow VERY brightly. I had to tape a piece of cardboard over the buttons to block out the glowing. This device also has the option to set a timer for the sound, from half an hour to an hour and a half. I always turn that off because I want it to play throughout the night. Oddly, even with the timer off, occasionally the sound will suddenly turn off halfway through the night for no particular reason. This wakes me up and then I have to turn it back on. Overall, if this worked right, I would recommend it. However, with all the other reviews saying this sound machine is glitchy and my own experiences, I cannot. I'd recommend one of the cheaper, simpler white noises sound on Amazon instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLOO3CBYT3XEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EREC7VA#wasThisHelpful","RLOO3CBYT3XEK","A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very long dress, which works out for me, since am 5'10"". Fits me below the knees, just like the model, so if you are shorter than 5'7"" you may find this to be too long. I ordered Green but received what looks like Sky Blue.... Waiting to see how the seller handles my complain.Love WOW dresses.Material is as expected from China, polyester. You can't wear a regular bra with this, has to be nipple covers and lace thong.UPDATE 3/12/15So, this seller has been very gracious to me in solving my problem. I now have received the replacement to what was in my opinion, the wrong color. I ordered Green, but received a Sky blue dress, I thought the warehouse shipped wrong color, turns out, this color is what the seller is calling Green. Look at the photos attached, I even took a close up of the dress I received, with the color on my screen/Amazon. Clearly, two different colors. The seller says the other color is a darker Navy, but looking at another reviewer's photo, that is blue. Anyway, all this rumbling is to simply give heads up to future buyers of what to expect when ordering Green. You will receive Sky Blue.As for the sizing, am obviously flat chested, unlike the model in the photo. That's why the back of her dress looks zigzag. This dress is made to fit Small-Medium, so it has a lot of stretch room. If you are blessed in the chest, you will look like the model, front and back. I will play around with it to fit my fame. Again, it's a very long dress.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KXRMFBMYB3F5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QLF8C6W#wasThisHelpful","R1KXRMFBMYB3F5","A31XUJMEDBUGKR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31XUJMEDBUGKR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ordered the purple dress in Small, my true US size.  Fits just like the model, except the sleeves are 3/4, not full sleeves. But then, am 5'10"", story of my life. Overall, happy with the dress, material must be a viscose or close to it. A tiny bit of stretch in it. I will order the blue one,  the length of the sleeves looks great too. Also, light material and see through if worn over light colors.Took only 10 days to arrive.UPDATE 3/11/15So i decided to order the blue one, after I had received and like the purple one. I received the blue one today. Same dress, same seller, but the size is way off! The photo looks nicely fitted dress, but it's unzipped in the back, I could hardly get into the blue dress. I ordered Small, fits like an Extra Small. The sleeves won't even pull up. The length is that of a mini dress. So I contacted the seller and let them know how their blue sizing is way off from the purple. I will update on how they handle that. The colors are not as reflected by my phone camera, they are true purple and blue in person, very pretty.UPDATE 3/31/15I got the replacement to the very small blue dress, but this time I asked for a Medium, which fits great! Except, the Blue Medium in a polyester material, not Viscous line the Purple and the Small Blue - I know, confusing. I suggest you ask the seller what material they are shipping in your color, if Viscous ( or what am thinking it is ), then order a size up, if polyester, order your trues size since they stretch, a lot. Overall, am a happy customer. Their sales person called Alen is very, very helpful!

"DraftSight is probably easy for people with a background in engineering, drafting, architecture or any other design field where CAD is taught as part of a degree or certificate program. Unfortunately, my background is as a hobbyist who wants to figure out how to accurately make stuff with a CNC machine, a 3d printer, or a laser cutter, stuff like buildings for model railroads, parts for model airplanes and that sort of thing. Besides, I recently took up a project where at least a basic understanding of all things CAD/CAE/CAM is going to be useful.There are a whole bunch of different programs that each do different parts of the things I want to do, so I figure the thing is to just dive into one of the programs and learn how to use it. So, for better or worse, DraftSight is the program that I am going to have to learn...on my own.I wish there was a bit more ""Do this, then do this, then do this followed by that"" in the first few chapters, but it beats the heck out of the instructional materials available from Dassault.I am a long way from being through with this book, but so far I have been able to do everything explained in the first three chapters and I am beginning to understand how the program works and what it does.CAD is not like word processing, you can't just start drawing crudely and then use the program to begin to do things faster and more accurately. There is a whole bunch of stuff that you have to know immediately to even make a simple line drawing. Anyway, I am going slow, and at the moment I am procrastinating by writing this review rather than working with the program.Back to the salt mines...","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15YMMGTQLUX7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESX13L0#wasThisHelpful","R15YMMGTQLUX7D","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this book in 2009. At the time, it was just about the only thing out there to help a non-engineer hobbyist or woodworker seriously dive into the project of building a CNC machine for the home shop. I did begin the process of building my own machine and got as far as cutting out all the MDF parts and obtaining some of the mechanical and electronic parts. But the further I dove into the project, the more I came to understand that my knowledge of things like Scalable Vector Graphics, G-Code, and of digital electronics and computer programming in general were lacking, and also far outside the scope of this book. I started playing around with Arduino, C++ programming, analog and then digital electronics, a local robotics society, and another advanced degree program, and I ended up putting this book aside, but that is NOT the fault of this book. CNC ended up on the back burner while I pursued other projects, but now I am back into it again.Currently I am building an X-Carve machine and should have it running in a few days. That caused me to go back and re-read this book, and to borrow a few others from the library, and truthfully, despite some great advances in the home shop/hobbyiest CNC arena, this is still a pretty good book on building and operating a CNC machine in the home shop. But it is important to realize that learning to use a CNC machine, or any other high technology endeavor is like peeling an onion, no one book is going to answer all your questions or tell you everything you need to know, and each thing you learn inspires a dozen new questions.I view this book as a good introduction to CNC. It will leave you with a clear understanding of how such things work. It will provide you with instructions that a literate, mechanically inclined, person with an intuitive understanding of basic engineering principles can follow. It is NOT a cookbook. You will have to do additional research, maybe even hit the library, the Intergoogler, or your local maker space for additional help. But this book will get you started and allow you to ask intelligent questions as you build a machine of your own.I do hope that Jim Kelly writes an updated version, but this book will set you on your way if you really want to build a CNC machine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q0JVIZWFUT8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1430224894#wasThisHelpful","R3Q0JVIZWFUT8K","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an old book and I had to read well into the fourth chapter before I figured out what the author was talking about. Then suddenly I realized that I was holding a guide book to arts and crafts design. I began to see that the author was talking about the proportions and design sensibilities of the Arts and Crafts movement and applying them to everything that might exist in the built environment, from book cases to motor cars. I've long been drawn to Arts and Crafts style houses, cabinets, and furniture, but had trouble creating my own designs to solve modern problems while retaining the lines and feel of the arts and crafts movement. Scaling a classic Stickley design to create, for example, a media cabinet, just wasn't working for me. I knew I needed to work from a fresh sheet of paper and not just copy or incorporate arts and crafts elements to get the Craftsman look.With this book, I have another piece of the puzzle. It is a sort of exercise book that might have been used in secondary schools between the wars. It is hard to follow and presumably the students who used this also had an industrial arts instructor prodding them in the right direction. But after a while I found I really could figure it out, particularly if I read it while sitting at a drafting board with pencil and t-square instead of trying to doodle it out in Sketch-Up.Neat little book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23SI8WU3ZDDS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BW8JL6I#wasThisHelpful","R23SI8WU3ZDDS8","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use a Shop Vac along with a small canister dust separator to control the dust from my sanders, small power tools, and compound miter saw. I have found it easiest to equip the vacuum with a long hose (20 feet) that I trail to the various machines rather than trying to drag the vacuum and the dust separator through the labyrinth that is my workshop. But this means constantly having to work my body through the maze to turn on the vacuum. Being lazy, or in a hurry, I either don't bother to turn on the vacuum for a quick cut, or I leave the vacuum running between operations, to the annoyance of the household. (Noise doesn't bother me, I'm wearing my earmuffs!)Still, leaving the vacuum running constantly is probably not good for it, and not turning it on makes for a messy shop. I thought about wiring up a couple of 3-way switches to control the vacuum, but snaking the wire and installing boxes is not my favorite pastime. After buying this at W*****t, I came here to torture myself for paying too much.This remote is rated 13 amps which should handle my large vacuum for the long haul. I haven't tested the range of the remote, but the vacuum hose, along with it's extensions can make up 40 feet and the range is at least that. The remote has separate ""on"" and ""off"" buttons and is equipped with a key chain. I removed the key chain and replaced it with a nice heavy piece of red white and blue ribbon to hang over pegs near each of the tools, but I still kept losing the remote. Then I added a carabiner and made a permanent home for the remote on a peg near the shop's light switch. Now I come into the shop, flip on the lights and clip the remote to a belt loop so it's handy wherever I am.I'm happy as a clam now...except for 2 little gripes. One is that I wish the remote had larger buttons and maybe molded from green (for on) and red (for off) plastic. I'll maybe fix this with plastic model paint, but a factory job would be nicer. The other gripe is that the base unit has a hang slot for just one screw. It ended up hanging by it's cord and I didn't like that. So I added a strip of ""Industrial Strength"" Velcro loop tape to the back of the base unit and a strip of hook tape on the wall. All squared away now.Initially I thought that it would be nice to have a manual over ride switch on the base unit. But in practice, I've never felt any need and suspect such a switch would unnecessarily raise the cost. I'm fine without, thanks.Bottom line, it is a great little accessory in my workshop and I am quite pleased with how well it works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLD0NHXXO5RK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZUKG6Y#wasThisHelpful","RLD0NHXXO5RK3","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But it sure looks high-def to me, and the movie was every bit as good as I remember from seeing it as a first run in a real movie theater.

"Every couple of years I buy whatever recent book Taunton Press has published on general carpentry. I don't build houses any more, but I do like to know how recommended practices have changed as more advanced materials have come to market and as we gain a better understanding of how buildings live and breathe with better insulation, vapor barriers, and high efficiency systems. Plus, knowing a trade paid my way through school and I have a couple of cubs around here that could do with some training up in current best construction practices so they have the same opportunity.This book covers traditional framing techniques quite well, gives great tips to help newer/younger carpenters to work more efficiently. Covers more power and pneumatic tools than earlier books which focused on hand tool work. I compare it favorably to Bob Syvanen and Larry Haun's books. If you are just getting started in the trades as a cub and are willing to do a bit of reading to get up to speed with that grumpy old guy you are working with, this is a good way to figure out what he was trying to tell you as he framed up that rake wall.sed to ask. (Tip, if you are not sure, do ask. It's much better to ask a ""stupid question"" than to screw up a building and get tagged by an inspector...or your foreman, and while the crew might razz you, most leads will appreciate it if you show that you are willing to learn.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27V8Z54P6QU26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600851460#wasThisHelpful","R27V8Z54P6QU26","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have a worn ring gear, this kit may be your only option, but this is not the ""best quality"" cutter set you probably want if you are the sort of person who likes to maintain things instead of contributing to the land fill.It is an adequate replacement cutter, but of lesser quality than the OEM cutter. Description is misleading. Required much modification and time in the workshop to rehab my 1606 sharpener. Fortunately, the 1606 sharpener is built to be easy dismantled, and it is easy to remove and replace the worn parts. It was clearly designed for longevity and for easy repair.Unfortunately, x-Acto/Elmers/Avery DO NOT make the commonly needed repair parts readily available.IF there was a listing for the proper cutter set for my commercial 1606 sharpener, I would have admitted to consumer error in purchasing the wrong set. However, Amazon does not have ANY listing for the proper cutter set, and this is the only listed replacement set that includes the ring gear (gray plastic gear with internal teeth) that was the most severely worn part of my sharpener.My sharpener failed because a student tried to sharpen the wrong end of a pencil and jammed the eraser ferrule into the cutters. This caused the drive gear teeth to shear off of one of the cutters, and destroyed the ring gear that spins the cutters normally. I ordered this set because it appeared from the photograph to be a dual cutter head that matched the existing cutter head in my sharpener and because it contained the needed ring gear. This is the only parts listing I could find that contained the ring gearFortunately, only one of my cutters was damaged, and was easily removed with a screwdriver. Unfortunately, the single cutter in this set is installed in such a way that I had to destroy the frame to remove the cutter and swap it into the still serviceable cutter frame in my machine.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M9F92TG6CDLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040263BE#wasThisHelpful","R3M9F92TG6CDLQ","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Greg Harvey writes well and in this book, he eschews much of the silliness that creeps into other ""Dummies"" books. It is an outstanding, step by step guide with hands on examples for guided practice to learn and efficiently use not only the main features of Excel, but also the semi ""hidden"" features that speed up your work and make it easier to build spreadsheets that are easier to use and to read.I am pleased to have the text, but I do regret not having the paper bound version. Kindle is great for reading novels, biographies, histories and the like, but for technical reading, the electronic format, whether on my Kindle, computer, or tablet, is not comfortable. I need to be able to highlight, write in the margins, add sticky notes and spill coffee on my technical books, and you just can't do that with electronic text. I knew that before I bought this, but I was snowed in so the Kindle edition was my only choice.Also, the paperbound version of this book comes with sample files and videos bundled on a disk. Some of the videos are available on the publisher's website, but they are hard to find and not in any organized order. It would be much better to have the disk.Still, this book is well done. Mr. Harvey tells you EXACTLY how to use the features of Excel in excruciating detail that some will find a bit pedantic. But frankly, that is exactly what I was hoping for. Just a couple of the lesser known tricks for using the AutoFill feature for example, have already saved me time and the keyboard short-cut of adding an apostrophe before data entry so that Excel treats a number as ""text"" instead of a value, is among the many other useful and powerful tips that I simply would not have learned by using a typical reference book.Having started using computers when Lotus 123 was king, I never really forced myself to learn the ins and out of Excel, and this book has already shown me dozens of ways to use the program more efficiently and get things done more quickly.The text is not only worth the price, it is worth the time I am spending to do the exercises.I am giving this book five stars for its content, but adding that caveat that it would have been well worth the wait and the expense of obtaining the bound version instead of the Kindle edition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSRKK81YTN86J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041D8VAI#wasThisHelpful","RSRKK81YTN86J","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Regrettably, I did not buy this at Amazon. If I had, I would have sent it back. As it is, this is a ""coffee maker kit"" and if you are willing to hack at it, you can make it into a serviceable machine. But it tends to make an annoying mess every morning, and who needs any extra annoyance when you are just trying to get out the door with a hot cuppa in the morning?I bought this to replace a Krups that I have used daily for 25 years. The Krups still works fine, but it is a commercial, two pot machine that overwhelms my small kitchen. As the only coffee drinker in the family, I wanted something a bit smaller.I don't know what they mean by ""five cups"". A cup is 8 ounces, and the carafe for this machine holds 26 ounces (the reservoir only holds 24) so I would call this a ""three cup"" machine. But it does fill my 15oz travel cup for my commute and a 10oz vacuum bottle for a warm-up mid morning. It has a timer that automatically starts the machine in the morning, and only starts it if I have prepared it with water and grounds the night before. It makes pretty good coffee. If I'd written this review the day after I brought this home, that's all I'd have to say and this would have been a four star review.The thing is, I really wanted to love this machine and for the first week I worked hard to accommodate or overlook its shortcomings. After that, I decided to put up with its annoyances, but each morning it ticks me off just a bit more and I don't like starting my day ticked off.The first problem is the carafe is drippy. In stock condition, it is really hard to pour coffee without spilling. This is partly due to the lid, its opening is too small. I attacked the lid with a scroll saw, cleaned it up with a Dremel tool and improved it, a bit, but I still spill coffee probably three days out of 5. Unfortunately, I can't just get rid of the lid, it is required in order to open the interrupter valve and allow coffee to drip into the carafe. I'll probably remove that in the next few weeks.The reservoir is equipped with a pair of mostly hidden, and frankly, unnecessary ""overflow"" holes. I assume that most people fill the carafe at the sink and then dump the carafe into the machine. Unfortunately, the overflow holes are too low. A full carafe overfills the reservoir and you end up with water all over the counter. Other reviews of this machine mention that it ""leaks"". Well here's why, you can't easily see the overflow holes and the ""water level gauge"" is essentially unreadable unless you stare straight down into the reservoir with strong light directly overhead, so you only know that you have filled the reservoir when water starts to flow all over the counter.The reservoir fill opening is obstructed by the spray arm assembly, the useless water level gauge, a cheesy ""chlorine filter"" assembly, and the reservoir lid which won't hinge back far enough for you to position the carafe squarely over the opening when you fill it with cold water. Not only do these obstruct your view of the overflow holes so that you can't see when the water reaches them, but they also make it difficult to pour water into the obstructed openings without splashing water everywhere.I made filling a bit easier by removing the water level gauge. I also removed the unnecessary chlorine filter (Coffee makers use a heat activated pump that brings the water to a boil, aerating it and flaring off the chlorine, so the filter is just a gimmick. Besides, no one sells the silly filter cartridges).The machine is hard to clean. The filter basket, permanent filter, and carafe, can all run through the dishwasher of course, but there is also a basket holder, and other parts of the machine with many hard to clean nooks and crannies that collect scale, stray coffee grounds, and other kitchen grotus. It grosses me out just knowing that there are pockets of guck inside the machine I can't completely clean.Coffee oils tend to condense on the spray arm and while this shouldn't affect the taste of the coffee, again, it's hard to clean and looks grotty.So, today, I gave the machine it's monthly cleaning. I was so annoyed with the water and vinegar I spilled and splashed everywhere while descaling it, and then with trying to clean the nooks and crannies with a tooth brush, that I dunked it (UNPLUGGED OF COURSE) in mild soapy water in the sink and attacked it with a scrub brush. Then I ran it through the dishwasher. It came out pretty clean, but more surprisingly, I didn't kill it.Post dishwasher, the clock, automatic timer, pump and warmer plate all still work. So there's a plus, it's a tough machine.I'll make a couple of plugs out of Sugru to fill the stupid overflow holes. I'll remove the drip interrupter so that it will work without the lid on the carafe. I'll learn to pour with greater care, and I guess I'll run it through the dishwasher every month or so since that's the only way to get it clean.Still, I wanted a simple machine with a timer that doesn't make a mess, instead I got a hobby project.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XCKZ6275DA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FN3HZ84#wasThisHelpful","R1XCKZ6275DA5","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are very good quality, heavy duty shelf brackets. They have a sturdy finish.

"There are several of these advertised on Amazon. Picking the right one was really a crap-shoot. The product descriptions are all pretty generic and the photos aren't much help. I read the reviews and tried to glean as much product information as I could and I think I chose the best one, but many of the reviews seem to be from people who don't really know what a J-Roller is for.The purpose of a J-roller is to apply pressure to plastic laminate in order to firmly bond it to your chosen substrate. It could also be use to apply pressure to linoleum, sheet vinyl, vinyl tile, rubber baseboards, or any other sort of sheet material that needs brief but firm contact pressure to activate or adhere an adhesive layer between two smooth, flat surfaces. But don't use it for spreading glue or contact cement, you will ruin it in short order, which is what my ""helper"" did to my last one.Anyway, on this roller, the roller itself is of reasonably pliable, but hard rubber which allows plenty of pressure to activate contact cement. There is an internal ""bearing"" roller of, probably HDPE or UHMW PE that rolls smoothly on the steel shaft. The roller itself is secured to the shaft with snap rings, so there is a chance you might be able to get it apart and clean it if your ""cub"" dips it into a can of contact cement. The one piece shaft/handle is of steel and is quite stiff, so you can bear down hard if need be.I understand that inexperienced workers may be bothered by the plastic grips which indeed can slip on the handle, but if the grips are slipping around on you, you are not using the tool correctly. Apply pressure perpendicular to the shaft, not radially or parallel to it. Every J-roller I have owned or used had the same ""problem"".In any event, it is JUST a J-Roller and while I suppose someone could make a ridiculously expensive one with ball bearings and leather grips, that would really be a waste.

The bottle itself is made of pretty soft polypropylene which makes it easier to control the flow of glue, but I suspect that it could split or be punctured easily if you dropped it or banged it against something sharp, but I'm not really worried about that.The roller cap is removable so you can take it off to clean it and the manufacturer has provided a separate screw-on lid to keep the bottle air-tight between uses.The only complaint I have is that the manufacturer has supplied a small molded plug that is supposed to cap the glue orifice when you are not using the bottle, this is attached to a molded ""leash"" which should keep you from losing the plug. Unfortunately the leash is stiff and tends to pull the plug out of the bottle. The cap itself is not really well molded and it doesn't want to stay in place. I clipped off the plug and threw it away. But I am not knocking off any stars, the roller has to be removed and cleaned after every use anyway and there is not any reason to try to use the roller cap as a lid for the bottle between gluing sessions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z6FSNS0PNX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CCXO04#wasThisHelpful","R1Z6FSNS0PNX1","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Took a long trip this summer and neglected bring the charger for the camera, which left the best parts of our trip a bit undocumented. I thought it might be smart to have an extra battery and a charger for the car, but when I stopped into one of the big electronics stores and saw the prices, I balked. When I found this combination on Amazon, I thought the price was a bit too good to be true, but the batteries seem to work fine and the charger works as promised both in the car and when plugged into the wall.

"First, I've had this chip separator for 2 years. I did not buy it at Amazon. It works ok for smaller stationary power tools such as router tables, lunch box planers, and bench top jointers. I upgraded to the most powerful shop vac I could find and it handles my 13"" planer if I make light cuts on narrow stock. But run a 2x10 through it, and much of the chip load from the planer passes through the separator and into the vacuum.Still, even on a large power tool, it is more effective than a vacuum alone, and much better than nothing at all. Let's be clear, the Dust Right DOES WORK. I immediately had a cleaner workshop. I went from completing the annoying process of dumping out the vacuum and cleaning it's pleated filter almost daily, to easily dumping the Dust Right once a week.It is MUCH easier to empty the separator than the vacuum and with the separator, you can use HEPA filter bags in the vacuum and only have to replace those about once a year. So, this should be a 5 star review, and it would have been if I'd written it 18 months ago. But I know so much more now!Here are the problems:Some people complain that the lid is hard to remove. But then talk about how hard it is to ""snap the lid on and off"". This is not a real problem. The lid does not snap on. it twists on and off. It does take a bit of time to get the knack of twisting off the lid, but the lid is easy to remove once you do.Second issue. It is tall and narrow, so it tips over all the time. When it tips over, gravity is no longer on your side and all the chips you have collected go immediately to the vacuum, which is what you were trying to avoid by buying this separator in the first place. So, it's a solve-able problem. Buy a package of clothesline rope, snug the dust right up next to your shop vac and bind them together with the rope so they roll around as one unit. This works really well and will give you a unit that's not much bigger than the very expensive Festool extractor. But wow, it's ugly, and we are craftsmen here, right?So, make elaborate plans to build a rolling cart that will contain your shop vac, the separator, a nice drawer for spare vacuum cleaner filter bags...Ain't nobody got time for that...amirite? Naw...So you rig up a block of 2x4 and cut a couple of radiuses out of the sides to hold the vacuum and the separator in alignment so the tension of the rope doesn't twist everything around.The other problem is that lid should have a wider radius. The inlet should enter tangent to the outside of the lid as far outboard as possible, and the exhaust should be centered. Then the heavier chips and dust would swirl around the walls and then drop to the bottom of the bucket, while the relatively clean exhaust air would be forced to the center and out to the vacuum. Add a Thein baffle and you'd be goldent...but still, it's tippy and that rope arrangement makes it a pain to empty, almost as bad as dealing with the vacuum...The Dust Right is better than nothing at all. In fact it is substantially better, and if you are a handy homeowner or a mere mortal, it may be all you need. But if you are aspiring to seriously gear up and whisper wood, the internet swarms with even better, home built alternatives that can be put together for less than the price of the dust right, and if you are reading this, you are a craftsman, right?","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ3FXYCQKY8LK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004N5QD3Q#wasThisHelpful","RZ3FXYCQKY8LK","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not the ""Best"" of the Moody Blues. It's more like ""A few snippets of some of the Moody Blues better tunes, heavily edited so we could cram it onto one CD and squeeze a bit more cash out of our master tapes"".If you were alive and listening to the radio in the 1970's, you will probably recognize most of the music on this album. If you liked the Moody Blues, you will probably like this just fine, at least at first. But after a few times through the album, you'll begin to wonder, ""gee, wasn't there more to that track..."" All of the tracks here...well, except for ""Go now"", what the heck is that doing on here? are recognizably great Moody Blues, but there is lots of stuff missing that ought to be on a ""Best of"" album, probably, it should have been a two record set.Another reviewer wondered why this album includes GO Now, and leaves out ""Late Lament"". I totally agree. The version of Go Now on this albumn sounds like it was recorded by someone in the back seat who had a cassette recorder, and held it up to the radio speaker while Go Now was playing on a distant AM station.

"I took off on a long summer car trip and neglected to bring my phone charger with me...subconsciously, I probably did that on purpose, but nevertheless, I found myself with a nearly dead battery.

"Is this an important book? Probably. But it's not as helpful as I had hoped.  Dweck proposes that some people believe they have innate abilities from birth and that's all there is. Once they reach a developmental plateau based on that innate ability, they think they cannot get any better. Others think that with hard work, they can figure out how to get better at anything. Bad at math? With practice I can get better. No good at music? Keep practicing. She is right of course, with practice and study over time, any of us can get better at anything. And while we are, some of us, better suited for one thing than another, our minds are capable of growth in every area.

"This is not a bad kit if you are an experienced builder of balsa wood model airplanes. I had originally planned to build this with my twelve year old son, but for reasons explained below, decided otherwise.I have compared the plans and specifications to a number of photos, books, and drawings of the ""real"" Spirit of Saint Louis, and I think this is a great choice if you want to construct a fairly accurate model of Charles Lindbergh's plane for display, but don't want to build it from scratch. However, if you are wanting a model airplane for a kid to build, this is not a good choice, even if you are willing to sit with your kid and guide him/her every step of the way.For me, this model will become a part of a series of historic aircraft to hang from the ceiling of my science classroom to demonstrate progress in aviation. Each model in the series will illustrate an important technological stride as well as an important milestone in history. As such, I am not building this one to actually fly. But my son and I will research the Spirit of St. Louis together and he will help me build the final display. I will complete this kit while he is working on a larger, but simpler laser cut, radio control model. That way we will have some shop time together, but I won't take over his project. (His model is a .40 Telemaster)While I am builiding my kit for display, I see no reason why a serious model builder couldn't build this into a respectable electric powered, RC park model. With LiPo batteries and the new ultra light gear, it should fly reasonably well, if less than stable, like the full scale prototype. If YOU are so inclined, I would recommend an internet search for ""Guillows Spirit of Saint Louis build"" to find one of several detailed and very helpful blog or forum entries that describe how to lighten, strengthen, and successfully build and fly a powered RC version of this kit.If you are a parent reading this, you probably WANT your kid to develop patience, perseverance, and a determination to learn MANY new skills and bring a complex project to completion. Model airplanes are a great vehicle for this, especially for middel school aged kids. They teach serious project management, engineering, and construction skills. But even if you are willing to sit with your kid every step of the way, this kit is a bit too complex and is likely to lead to frustration for the kid and a pretty unsatisfactory result unless you take over, in which case...BORING!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B6EM046VLS2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006GZ39G#wasThisHelpful","R3B6EM046VLS2A","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Assembling this pole is a huge part of the product and while I normally refrain from downgrading a product due to poor instructions, in this case the instructions are poor and the product is of substandard quality too. I am regretting that at the time I bought this, there were only 2 reviews up, which didn't tell me enough to stay away.On the other hand, it is remarkably hard to find in-ground basket ball poles of any kind out there, so even if I HAD seen some negative reviews, I might have bought it anyway. However, knowing what I know now, I might have gone to the steel yard, bought some steel tubing and then asked the school shop class to weld me up a pole...and that's what I recommend you do.Here's the deal, I spent many years as a carpenter and have probably installed 20 - 30 basketball systems for customers. The assembly instructions for this one are among the worst I have ever seen. Unfortunately, I let this sit in a corner of my shop for far too long and felt that it would be dishonest to send it back. Besides, my 11 year old spent 3 days hand digging the foundation hole so I couldn't very well refuse to install it at this point.The instructions are printed in ten languages and I am not exaggerating. Congratulations to Huffy/Spalding for having such an international customer base, but did you have to try to talk to all of us at the same time? The instructions are like trying to read the blueprints for the Tower of Babel. Each page contains a sparse and ambiguous diagram along with accompanying written instructions in all ten languages. There's a sentence in English, then in Spanish, then French, German, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, etc. Then they print the second sentence, again in each language, so that as you read the instructions you have to constantly stop, skip over 10-20 lines of text, and then try to find the next line that happens to be in your preferred language.Hint to buyers, get out your highlighter. Go through the whole manual and highlight the sentences in your language. I did this, it helps, but still, the instructions are a nightmare.Hint to Spalding, it's the second decade of the 21st century. There is this thing called the internet and guess what? You HAVE a website. Let your customers download an instruction set in their preferred language, 'cause this multilingual effort looks like the menu from a roach coach on the Plain of Shinar.OK, so after sorting through the language of the instructions, we get to the meat of the assembly.Here are some warnings that Spalding/Huffy neglects to give you:From prior experience I know this -- DO NOT TIGHTEN DOWN ANY OF THE BOLTS UNTIL YOU HAVE STOOD THE MAST UP, FILLED IT WITH CONCRETE, AND LET IT CURE, Otherwise you will run the risk of crushing the pole. Other manufacturers of basketball poles include this warning early on. Spalding/Huffy should have too.Spalding also directs you to completely assemble the pole, backboard and hoop, and fill the pole with concrete before you stand the pole. BIG MISTAKE and we avoided it thanks to prior experience. The pole alone requires a bit more than a full bag of concrete to fill. That's 80 pounds of concrete, 9 pounds of water, and 30 - 40 pounds of backboard and hoop and another 50 of pole and lift assembly...roughly 180 pounds of top heavy, asymmetric load you are trying to swing around, stand perpendicular, dead lift, and tuck into a 3"" hole in the ground that has ragged, fragile edges. It took four adults to lift ours into place and that was WITHOUT the concrete.Oh, it really does require 435 pounds of concrete to install this pole. That's a bit less than SIX 80 pound bags of redimix concrete. If your installation uses much less than that, expect trouble.You CAN step the pole without the hoop installed, and I suggest you do. However, the lift mechanism has to be built on the backboard and then added to the pole assembly, meaning you pretty much have to install the backboard before you step the pole. Huffy/Spalding need to redesign this but it would probably obsolete their line of backboards. Bummer.Now, as to the instructions themselves. Beyond the language problem, they are still very hard to follow. Apparently someone at Huffy/Spalding thinks that owning a copy of Microsoft Publisher means they don't need to hire a graphic artist or a technical writer. Hint: Huffy, this is a complex product with a lot of little parts, including many that are un-necessary depending on which backboard and hoop your customer buys. Invest in a graphic artist and a technical writer. Have them assemble the product according to their own instructions and then revise until they get it right.There should be spacers to install on BOTH of the attachment points for the lift balance springs. I'm making some up for my installation but Huffy/Spalding really should supply some.Also, the instructions for the spacers to be installed between the backboard mounting brackets are pretty much opaque, eventually you can figure out where they belong if you stare at the instructions until your eyes bleed but even then, you realize that the brackets should have been drilled so you can install the spacers at the edges of the brackets so they can support the lift assembly. Also the lift assembly would be far sturdier if there were spacer tubes to go between the brackets on the 1/2"" lift shaft bolts to keep this assembly from flexing. There is a lot more, but if I am going to give engineering advice to Huffy/Spalding, I want to be paid for it.Finally as to the quality of the product itself. It is made largely of powder coated steel, so it should continue to look nice, but it's pretty light gauge stuff, so it may bend or tear apart under the load of teen-age basketball. My kids are still pretty young, but I am not going to be happy replacing this thing in five years (Hopefully we will be building a new garage on top of the basketball court by then, rendering the point moot.)My biggest concern is that the attachment between the lift assembly and the backboard is pretty flimsy. There are just four bolts on a 2"" x 6"" layout. The horizontal spacing is only 2"", so there is not much to keep the backboard from flapping on the vertical axis. I opted for a spring loaded hoop which will give some relief from movement on the horizontal axis, but then again the so called ""elevator tubes"" are pretty long and spindly. The manufacturer says very clearly ""DON""T HANG ON THE HOOP OR THE NET"" and they are probably right. I seriously doubt that the system would hold much above fifty pounds of live load. I don't think it will fall and kill anyone. If I did, I'd not have finished installing, but it won't take much to bend the lift mechanism and make the system unplayable.Annoyingly, the configuration of the lift assembly and the structure of the backboard would allow the board to attach to the lift on a 12 x 12 mounting square which would firm up the whole thing immensely. I may spend a bit of time welding up some new brackets just to accomplish this.The bottom line is that my kids will be able to play basketball and only play basketball with this set. I hope they don't get the idea to tie a tetherball to it, or for that matter a jump rope, and if they shinny up the pole to replace the net, or try to hang from the edge of the backboard, I'm afraid they may pull the lift assembly into a pretzel.Bottom line? I'd suggest you, gentle reader, keep looking.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29VM1LZJ5Q5SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009VC9G8#wasThisHelpful","R29VM1LZJ5Q5SJ","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little engine for the price and mine ran nicely right out of the box, just from the heat of a hot cup of coffee. It worked well, but made a ""click-clack"" that drew the attention of that cat. She jumped up on the table and attacked the motor, knocking it apart and spilling coffee everywhere...She is now Cattus non-Grata. I reassembled it and it would not run at all. GRRRRR.I made a careful study of the machine. I ended up taking the motor almost entirely apart and then carefully reassembling it. In the end, I have it running much faster, and more smoothly and quietly. The parts are reasonably well made and there is just enough room for adjustment that you can really make it sing with a bit of effort.Things to look for:The large piston (called the displacer) is a foam disc that is press fit to the connecting rod extension shaft. It is possible to pull the connecting rod up too far and pull the shaft out of the displacer piston. Then the motor will not run. You have to take apart the cylinder by removing the screws and pulling off the bottom plate. Then put the piston back onto the shaft like putting a record on a turntable. Reinsert the shaft into the piston. How far? I'm not sure, the motor operates as long as the shaft is fully inserted into the piston and there is room for adjustment through a 1cm range. There is probably an optimal location but I have not figured out a systematic way to determine it, and it may be dependent on operating temperature. Be gentle. There is a seal at the top and bottom of the clear plastic cylinder walls and you do not want to damage this or knock it loose.The small piston (called the drive piston) appears to be ground glass and you can add some graphite powder to the side of the piston to make it slide more perfectly. I did this, but frankly, it doesn't seem to have made much difference and since it makes the motor a little less pretty, I would not do it again.The drive piston has a spring steel wrist pin assembly that is pressed in. Watching the motor run, I noticed that the connecting rod can move back and forth on the wrist pin. This accounts for most of the ""click-clacking"" I think. It appeared to me that the wrist pin was not perfectly perpendicular to the plane of the connecting rod. I pulled out the wrist pin fitting with a small hook probe (A/K/A bent paper clip) and then carefully pushed it back in, trying to get it as square as possible in the cylinder. I could not think of any way to do this except by hand and eye.I also found, experimentally, that I could rotate the connecting rods 180 degrees and get smoother operation. The machine is made from light weight materials that can be easily bent or knocked out of alignment and it is a 30 dollar machine, not a 3000 dollar one, so manufacturing tolerances simply cannot be perfect. The trick to getting it to run as perfectly as possible is to tweak what you can so that the errors in tolerance cancel out as much as possible.Anyway, it is never going to be powerful enough to turn a generator or do any other useful work, but it is a fun little mechanism to play with and it is interesting exercise to work out how it operates and tune it for top performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HPFDJ5BUVAFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JOKO1O#wasThisHelpful","R1HPFDJ5BUVAFE","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been wearing one of these more days than not for the past 35 years. My first one was claimed by my son a few years ago. My second remains in good shape, but it's wool and it gets a bit hot to wear in the summer. I bought this one in cotton because I thought it would be more comfortable and I am not disappointed. It arrived this morning, just in time for me to wear it to the annual town parade. I received many complements on my taste in hats.For the first hour or so, the hat felt a bit loose on my head, but in my experience these do seem to start out a bit large. After a few hours of wear they shrink up a bit and conform perfectly. This one appears to be no exception. It already feels just as secure and comfortable as it's predecessor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30N3TR62MX5BN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKI0SG2#wasThisHelpful","R30N3TR62MX5BN","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I play with computer programming as a hobby. I'm not good at it. I probably never will be unless I decide to take a month to just sit and write code for hours and hours. If I could do that, I think I'd be reasonably competent.But that is never going to happen. Still, Every once in a while I run into a problem that needs code for it's solution, so when I have some spare time, I try to learn a little bit more. I am jealous of my free time and I don't waste it on resources that are not genuinely helpful. Furthermore, I don't have regular access to an instructor that can give me a leg over the fence when I get stuck. So I keep buying books on programming and when I have a bit of time, I dive in. For C++, I have this and Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++. Both are well written, but let's face it, I'm trying to make up in reading what I lack in the leisure time to just sit and write code until I attain mastery.I read a chapter in this and take a stab at the exercises. If I hit a stumbling block, I read the comparable chapter in Stroustrup and work through his exercises, again, until I get stuck, and then it's back to Alex Allain. I get maybe a one or two hour block of time to play with computers each week. It's not enough, but slowly I'm starting to learn a bit about coding.One of the great things about this book however, is that Alex Allain also has a great website and he publishes a regular programming newsletter which presents a new aspect of C++ programming every few days. The newsletters are not in sequence with his book, but they provide a wealth of background knowledge that slowly comes in to focus as I work on other aspects of programming.I bought the Kindle edition of this book and I keep it open on a second screen as I work through his instruction. The book was well worth the purchase price and is far more than a recapitulation of the website and newsletters. If you are in a place where you can seriously and systematically dedicate your efforts to learning programming, I think this book will help you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNNNDW2V01OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9311YC#wasThisHelpful","R3DNNNDW2V01OO","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chris Turney and his team are getting a lot of undeserved criticism for their ""eco-tourism"" trip to Mawson's Huts last December. This book was published before then and I was in the middle of reading it when the news of the stranding of the Akademik Shokalskiy hit the intertubes. There are determined ""skeptics"" who will not admit that any sort of Antarctic research is justified, but for people of reasonably open mind, troubled by the stranding of the Shokalskiy, this book just might help you understand that such research is valuable and that Turney's trip to Mawson's huts was entirely reasonable.Every school kid knows, or at least should know something of the Amundsen/Scott race to the pole. But few children, or adults know of the Australian and Japanese expeditions that were unfolding at the same time. Three of the four expeditions were serious scientific efforts that produced a large volume of valuable data. The fourth was a sporting venture, revered for it's success, but it produced less science than any of the other expeditions.Consequently, I find it  a bit curious that modern internet geniuses censure Turney's truly scientific ""tourist trip"" to the Antarctic yet celebrate Amundsen's trek to the pole.Turney is, in fact a scientist and historian.Amundsen, smart and winter savvy, nevertheless, really was a tourist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBQBITPMPVM50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009W7H96U#wasThisHelpful","RBQBITPMPVM50","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"KitchenAid mixers are great, but the epoxy coating on their metal, flat paddle mixer blade isn't, and besides, when you are creaming butter, making pancakes, or mixing up chocolate chip cookies, the metal blade leaves much of the butter/batter/dough unmixed on the side of the bowl. This beater blade solves that problem.Some people complain that this blade is made from ""crummy plastic that breaks"". Guess what? That's what Maaatha would call ""a good thing"". Here's why. KA Mixers are tough, but they are not indestructible. KA knows this, so they put a plastic worm gear in the drive train. The point of this plastic gear is that if you grossly overload the mixer, you won't burn out the mixer's motor, you just shear off this gear, which is about an $8 part, much cheaper and easier to fix than replacing the entire motor, and that little old guy who owns the neighborhood repair shop can replace it for around $20 bucks!But wait... that little old repair guy gave it up about ten years ago...and now you have to mail your mixer to the big shi....city for repairs...and they want $!%)...150!!! OUCH! Well, that's why this beater is a GREAT idea. Buy TWO!. WHEN you overload your mixer, this beater will break, saving your motor. Put in your spare beater, add some liquid to your dough and you are back in business. And by the way, if you drive your KA mixer hard enough to break one of these blades, you WOULD have killed any other mixer beyond-hope-dead.Also, replacing that worm gear isn't all that hard, it's messy and time consuming, but not hard and if you bake a lot of bread you probably ought to learn how to do it because those little old guys and their neighborhood repair shops are disappearing fast.

"The kids had been propping their music books on a chair, but now that they've shown me that they are serious about learning their instruments, I decided that a good music stand was in order. We've had this for a couple of months now. The only issue I had was that the machine screw that secures the shaft to the base was shipped, already installed in the shafts and I had to chuck the shaft up in a vise to get the screw out in order to complete assembly. But this should be well within the capability of anyone intelligent enough to be able to read sheet music.The stand is sturdy and stable and it gets adjusted up and down for different sized musicians daily. We have had no issues with noise or stickiness in adjusting the stand.

"I rolled the dice when I bought this because the pictures and description did not contain all the information I really wanted. I bought this antenna to replace one which had an unfortunate encounter with a toddler. Now that both kids are old enough to understand that Daddy doesn't like coat hanger wire antennae on the radios, I'm ready to make repairs.This antenna has a swivel assembly at the bottom. The swivel assembly is a short cylindrical section the same diameter as the bottom element of the main antenna. The end is machined like a clevis which receives a paddle shaped horn fitted to the end of the bottom element. A small machine screw acts as a clevis pin, passing through a hole in the horn and threading into one leaf of the clevis.I was able to remove the comparable machine screw from the swivel assembly and remove the remains of my old antenna from my older GE multi-band radio. Similarly, I was able to remove the swivel assembly from this antenna in the same manner and install the new antenna to the old antenna's swivel. The repaired antenna works in exactly the same fashion as the old one, able to be retracted inside the case of the radio for transport, but be pulled out to the same length of the original, and fully able to be angled or swiveled for best reception.The only ""problem"" was due to my persnickety nature. The old antenna had a can shaped cylindrical ""button"" at the tip which was threaded onto the end of the final element of the antenna. This one has a shorter ""button"" that is welded to the final element. I cut the new button off with a razor saw and then cut 2-56 threads at the end of the element. Then I threaded the old button onto the new antenna, and now the radio is substantially indistinguishable from it's original condition. Once everything was fitted up, I applied a bit of blue loctite on all the threads so that nothing would fall apart.The antenna was shipped in a tight layer of bubble wrap, placed into a plastic mailing envelope. I ordered on a Tuesday and it arrived in plenty of time for me to complete the repairs the following Saturday.This vendor has several other similar antennae in different sizes, and lists the collapsed and extended length and number of elements, so now that I know the configuration of the swivel assembly, I am ready to order two more of these to replace the broken antennae on two other radios that the toddlers got to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11EMCHVX1S447/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OV72MQ#wasThisHelpful","R11EMCHVX1S447","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed watching the first few episodes of American Restoration, where they actually delved into the details of HOW these guys complete the restorations. But after the first season, they fell into this creative rut. A couple of beat up old collectibles come in...they take them apart...off screen...Brettly sandblasts everything...off screen...someone fabricates a missing part...off screen...the parts get painted or powdercoated...off screen...some broken mechanism gets taken apart, cleaned up, polished, reassembled and repaired...off screen...HURRY the customer is coming in, thirty seconds after they discover some seemingly insurmountable problem...this is solved, magically, off screen. The thing is delivered, roll credits.In between all of the repairs and refinishing, there is this continual reality show fifth business going on. Brettly gets a dog, Kowboy has a toothache, Ron bought some stupid, unrepairable, unsalable item, Tyler forgot some critical step, Kelly gets miffed at Rick. It's all pretty predictable and hard to believe it's not all scripted.I started watching this with my kid because he likes to take apart and repair old toys and other stuff. Consequently I watched pretty much the whole 1,2, and 3d seasons, but we both agreed that the language was unnecessarily vulgar, the restorations were progressively less interesting, we stopped learning anything useful, and that the details of the American Restorations ""family"" were sort of not any of our business.Rick Dale is clearly a smart, well skilled, knowledgeable mechanic, engineer, artisan, businessman, and historian, but it is hard to see that through the ""Hey, hey, hey, we's all just a buncha dumb hicks out here in the desert, fixin' up this old crap and selling it to people with more money than sense"" schtick that the producers have layered over the whole thing.

"Assuming you choose the correct splitter for your application, this one is very well made. The plug locks securely into the 240V outlet of the generator and the two receptacles each have a glowing orange neon pilot lamp so you can peak out the window of your camper at night to verify that both of your generator's circuits are churning away merrily. Properly connected this splitter will allow you to safely double the number of devices that you are running off your generator, or, in the alternative, reduce the wear and tear on your machine.Take care to buy the right splitter because there are several types. This review will help you choose.My generator, a Yamaha EF3800, like many in the sub 5000 Watt range, has two standard wall-type outlets with a label reading ""20 Amps"". It also has a twist lock outlet labeled 120 volts 30 Amps and a second twist lock outlet labeled 120/240 Volts, 20 Amps.This splitter allows me to turn the 240 Volt circuit into TWO 120 volt, 20 Amp circuits. This is neither magic, nor dangerous, your generator is built to do this as long as the total load on each leg is less than 1/2 of the total rating of your generator...and you have appropriate sized extension cords, and you are not doing anything stupid, like trying to use all of the generator's outlets at once. Either use the two regular receptacles, or the 30 Amp, 120V RV hookup, or the 120/240 V, but NOT a combination, and never all three at once, unless you like the sound of tripping breakers and the smell of hot wires.When I bought my generator nearly 20 years ago, I thought I could get 20 Amps out of each of the standard wall outlets. I figured that the others were for plugging in a boat or an RV which I didn't have and that I could ignore them for construction site use. I ran my 12 amp compressor and my cordless tool battery chargers on one outlet and my radio and 13 amp Skilsaw, or drills, etc, on the other, and I got away with it for, what in hindsight was a remarkably long time. This is because I was working alone, cutting, then nailing, but never both at once.As soon as I recruited a helper so that we were each working simultaneously and I fired up the saw while the compressor was running, or the compressor kicked in while I was running the saw, ""click"" went the breaker. I initially thought that it was because my generator was getting old, not because I was doing it wrong.Eventually I learned more about electricity and how my generator worked, and I ""home brewed"" a splitter much like this one. Most generators have two power coils, let's call them X and Y, which is what the electrical code, and probably the schematic for your generator calls them. The wall receptacle on my generator draws only from the X coil to deliver 120 Volts, meaning that I was putting all the load on just one coil. The Y coil just sits there all forlorn unless you need 240 Volts to run heavy power equipment, or you use a splitter like this.This particular splitter has a 4 prong NEMA L14-20P (L for locking, 14 for 1 cable/4 wires, 20 for 20 Amps, P for ""Plug"") twist-lock plug assembly. This means it fits into a 4 prong L14-20R (R for ""Receptacle"") outlet. Look closely at your generator's outlets, you will probably see a similar set of letters and numbers on your generator. If you don't see letters and numbers (they are small and they are engraved in, not printed, so they are hard to see) look at the actual receptacle. What you are looking for is a receptacle with 4 prong-holes arranged in a circular fashion. ONE of the four holes is L shaped.You need THIS adapter if one leg of the ""L"" is angled OUTWARD from the circle.If instead, the L shaped prong angles inward, you have a NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturer's Association) L14-30R receptacle, and you need on of theseConntek YL1430520S Generator Y Adapter 30 Amp 125/250 Volt 4 Prong Male Plug To 15/20 Amp Connector instead.Here's a bit more electrical wiring information in case you are curious.The four prongs have names. Looking at your plug and receptacle, with the L shaped prong on top. This is the grounding prong, marked ""G"" for ""G""round. The bottom prong is marked ""W"", which of course stands for Neutral. The two prongs on the left and right are ""X"" and ""Y"". X is on the left if you are looking at the plug, and on the right if you are looking at the receptacle.If you connect your device between X and Y, you get 240Volts to Zap your big old table saw to life. Connect between X and W, or Y and W and you get 120 Volts to run your smaller tools and appliances. ""W""hite or neutral is at the same electrical potential as ""G"" so that if something screws up, all those electrons run safely to the ground rather than through your arms and legs.Whether you need your generator for camping, construction, or just back up power in case of a power failure, use one of these splitters and divide your tools or appliances evenly between the two legs of the splitter. This will evenly load your generator and reduce wear and tear on the machine.Oh, and my home brewed splitter (an electrician helped me) worked just fine but it was scrounged from the trash pile on a construction site, made of bits of BX cable, a four gang J-box, second hand receptacles and the cheapest L14-20P I could find at the time. It looked ugly and anyway, I can't remember (OK, maybe I deliberately forgot) who I loaned it to. This one is much prettier, looks safer with it's nice cushy plastic insulation, is well made, and I am quite pleased with the purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L2MROC7INF21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0IDFBM#wasThisHelpful","R2L2MROC7INF21","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are good quality gears that are apparently made in small batches when a sufficient number have been ordered. I bought them to construct a drill press extension table I saw in an issue of Shop Notes magazine.

"I bought three of these cord sets, one for a nativity scene, and the other two to install in some small lamps my kids made.They consist of a 5Watt C7 bulb and a bulb housing (""socket"") with a spring steel clamp that will secure the housing nicely in a 1"" diameter hole in the back or bottom of your project. The spring clamp will nicely snap in to a hole through 1/8"" masonite or plywood. The clamp will wedge into thicker stock up to about 3/4"". If you need to put it though a thicker base, such as a slab of 2x4, you'll need to drill a countersink.The lamp cord is 2 meters (just over 6ft) long. The rotary switch assembly is located about 1/2 way between the lamp holder and the plug. The plug assembly is equipped with a replaceable 5 amp fuse.I replaced one of the supplied bulbs with a 3 watt LED that puts out light equivalent to a 25 watt bulb. It is very bright indeed.Other reviewers here have expressed concern about the lead warning attached to the line cord. Please be aware that this applies to the lightbulb itself, which, like nearly all incandescent bulbs, has a blob of solder, (a tin, copper, and silver alloy that may also contain lead) on the hot terminal. There is no lead danger unless you allow your kids to put light bulbs in their mouths.These cord sets are ideal for craft projects that require a small light bulb at the end of a 6 foot cord.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V1AJTPMFBSAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VX6A5K#wasThisHelpful","R1V1AJTPMFBSAH","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this in one sitting. It's an easy read, but it was not a waste of time.I learned a lot about Newton. I was confronted with the reality that Newton himself was NOT a Newtonian, which makes his accomplishments all the more impressive. Even the least scientific among us take Newtonian principles for granted. Though many of us fumble to enunciate Newton's laws, they are universally understood, almost as if by instinct or primordial memory. Inertia, gravity, and action-reaction live within us even if we were busy flirting when we were supposed to learn them in schoolNewton on the other hand lived in an age when the laws he discovered defied notice and common sense. As such, it is all the more amazing that he discovered ""Newtonian"" physics at all.

"If you are trying to convince your administrator or school board to assist your effort to incorporate ""Making, Tinkering, and Engineering in [your] Classroom"", then this is a good book to have in your arsenal. In fact, I'd recommend you purchase a hardcover copy and lend it strategically to the decision makers in your school. But if you are already convinced of the value of building a maker space, or tweaking an existing school shop in a STEAM-ier direction, have school support for that effort and just need guidance to equip your space and develop curriculum, probably you need something else.Still, this is a great book to have on the shelf if you need to talk with skeptics who think school needs to be all about preparing for the PARCC or SMARTER assessments. Read this, read Shop Class as Soulcraft, and subscribe to Make Magazine, and you will be well equipped to explain that what the 21st century workforce really needs is to be able to handle a soldering iron, program an Arduino, carve a plaque with a CNC laser, and 3d print a dog whistle, and explain it all with calculus. Table saw, lathe and MIG welding skills won't hurt either, even if, or ESPECIALLY if little Janey was down for Tuck at age 2.The 21st century workforce is not learning how things are made. Though children are born with creative skills, we are editing those skills out of them at earlier and earlier ages. Deprived of concrete creative play and creative learning experiences as schools are forced to emphasize the all-mighty tests over all, today's kids will be ill-equipped for concrete creative work as adults. Yet growing world problems will demand extremely creative solutions at the very time these kids are entering the world of college and career.Read this book and help STEM the tide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG1NXBL4E72WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQDRF84#wasThisHelpful","RG1NXBL4E72WA","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About 5 years ago I took my then 6 year old son to a robotics workshop. At the time I had not much more than a basic understanding of electric circuits. I'd built small electric motors and crystal radios from kits as a kid, but in reality, I couldn't have told you the difference between a shift register, a microcontroller, and a 555 timer. Still, I became fascinated with the possibilities of using the brains of the small robots for other interactive projects. A friend mentioned Arduino and I bought a Duemilanove. I learned a lot from it.But many of the projects I've conceived require only one or two I/O ports, and even though Arduino boards are comparatively cheap, it still seems a waste to leave 30 bucks worth of hardware inside a project that does little more than rotate a servo or blink a light in response to an input. I get things made, and then I am loathe to take them apart even though I need the board for another project.A couple of years ago I decided that what I really wanted was to get ""much closer to the metal"" by breadboarding the projects to test, then wiring them up permanently on perfboard, or as ""dead bugs"" powered by drycell batteries. Most of the basic Atmel/AVR chips are around a buck and most of my projects don't need more than five bucks worth of other components, so if I could wire and program AVRs directly, avoiding the cost of the Arduino board, I could make up projects that I could maintain permanently, or give away with little remorse about the price of the parts.In my early attempts I bought a USBtinyISPkit from LadyAda and made a start following her tutorials at ADAFRUIT. Ms. Fried and her team do a great job, but I didn't have a lot of free time to hunt down internet resources to help me develop the projects I had in mind. I wanted a nice reference book that would hold my hand through the process of setting up AVRs and modifying my Arduino projects, showing me the tool kit all in one place without the need to fumble around on the 'net for answers to basic questions. The books on the market at the time were aimed at engineers, above my knowledge level and beyond my need. I put the project on hold.But when this book was announced, it seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. I ordered it right away and then waited impatiently for spring break so I could dive into it.I am not disappointed. This book is a great guide. I quickly was able to blink a simple ""hello world"". I followed Mr. William's instructions to use my Arduino as a programmer. Then I repeated the process using my AdaFruit programmer.Though I already had some experience with Arduino, Basic Stamp, and Picaxe microcontrollers, I don't think any of that experience was necessary for me to get rolling with the AVR using this book as a guide.As a school teacher, I frequently try to put myself in the place of may students and while AVR programming is a bit above the grade level I teach, I am fairly confident that any motivated beginner able to pass algebra could dive straight into AVR programming following this guide. Mr. Williams does not assume a lot of previous knowledge, but on the other hand, he also doesn't insult the intelligence of more advanced experimenters. If you have programming and electronics experience, but haven't messed with microcontrollers, I think you will still find this book useful.Moreover, if you are interested in learning to program but become bored with the sorts of projects you find in a straight ahead programming text, you may find that the blinky light, buzzy beeper, and whirring motor sorts of projects in this book are a bit more engaging than the manipulation of text strings and conversion of temperature tasks that live on screen alone.I have along way to go to become a true master of microcontrollers, and a complex work life frequently causes me to put aside my hobby projects for weeks at a time. But so far, this book is proving to be an outstanding guide to AVR programming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PFF5G2HHX0V6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449355781#wasThisHelpful","R3PFF5G2HHX0V6","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...read this. If you've read this, read Biplane too.Richard Bach, better than anyone I've ever read, portrays the way that small planes, especially old, unique ones, progress from being a collection of bolts and sheet metal, to friends and partners with personality quirks, needs and demands all their own.When I read that Bach and Puff had clipped a power line last year, I was of two minds: One could have come from the messiah mechanic, Donald Shimoda, ""Richard, just visualize NOT snagging the powerlines"". The other, a line from Johnathan Livingston Seagull was directed toward Puff, ""We don't tackle flying through rock until a little later in the program.""Biplane, and Travels with Puff tell similar stories but from opposite perspectives in time. If you like things that fly, both are well worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FAIKNHWMQ895/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BW9LQLU#wasThisHelpful","R1FAIKNHWMQ895","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many people who own old machines have noticed their tendency to develop idiosyncrasies, moods and characteristics...personalities if you will, that almost make them seem alive, as if they are actually trying to communicate with their human operators. But I suspect that owners of old airplanes notice this sooner than the owners of, for example pickup trucks and tablesaws.Bach trades his old Fairchild monoplane for an even older, rare antique biplane and spends a few weeks flying it cross county. He and we become acquainted with his new toy, which, by the end of the book has grown from a mechanical assemblage of wood, meta, canvas and wire, into an old and familiar friend.Better than any other writer I've read, he captures that magic moment when a small airplane, rattling and vibrating down the runway, comes alive in its natural element, the air.It has been interesting to compare this book, one of Bach's first, to his latest book, Travels with Puff, in which he completes a similar journey in a much newer, but no less unique seaplane. For people who view airplanes as nothing more than a means of transport, both books may fall flat, but if you are fascinated by things that fly, you will love both.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FU553HFRYNPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MAU1KU#wasThisHelpful","R2FU553HFRYNPX","A339NU1P1IUU03","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A339NU1P1IUU03?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It really is like having my old vet around, he was just as down to earth and rational.The book is put together in a rather haphazard way, a bit less handy for reference, but I do think it's part of the charm. The book is written as if the old country vet is talking to you, in his own voice, sharing his experience and his wisdom.And lots of nice anecdotes.

"Buy this even if you are not into the Paleo lifestyle! This is a great cook book. The recipes are indeed very easy and quick to make. Some are very original, combinations I never thought of before, they all taste great. I was staying with a friend when I brought it and we had so much fun making all the dishes! I had to leave the book behind and get a new one for myself.My husband loves rice so it's easy: I just add a rice of baked potatoes for my husband or guests, and I myself get to eat perfect, tasty, healthy Paleo.The book is a hardcover, always nice, especially for a book which is going to be used a lot.Actually, I have been using it so much that the leaves have loosened. Although it is a hardcover it's not sewn, but only glued. I did not take a star off for this flaw because I really really love the recipes in this book. I might take them out an have them wire bound, use it for the rough kitchen work, and then I'll buy another one for keeps :)It is great to ''work'' with, The left page holds the recipe, the ingredients, and macronutrient profile, the right page shows a photo of the meal, and the ingredients! I really like that.The book is divided by meal times:BreakfastLunchDinner,appetizers and snacks (yumm)Sauces and toppingsRubsThere are some great breakfast dishes which also work great for lunch or dinner, there are finger foods, one of which is my favorite: Chicken with almond coconut dipping sauce. Trust me, it is to die for! I have made it as the main meat dish for dinners, I have taken it to parties... it is gorgeous.I have invited guests just so I could make an enormous lot of it!And it is super quick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6XQW7QW7V4U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982207743#wasThisHelpful","R6XQW7QW7V4U4","A2UVZI95SPP3OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UVZI95SPP3OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let's make it clear, this is not going to compete with my Gillette razor.Here is what I like with it:- It is much cheaper than the Gillette blades.- It manages to shave my mustache fairly well (I use no shaving cream)- The blades rinse very welll- The silicon edges are virtually unusable.Here is what I like less:- It does not provide as close a shave as my Gillette blades. When I insist and shave against the usual side, I end up cutting myself.- It is almost completely made of plastic.In conclusion:If you have the means, keep using more expensive blades, your skin will thank you but if you are on a budget, it does a fairly good work.Edit 10/08/15I have shaved 5 days in a row with the same blade and there is not one day when I did not nick my skin somewhere and felt the razor burn.In comparison with my much more expensive Gillette blades, the shaving is nowhere as nice, fast and close.In consequence, I have changed my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars.

"These gloves have a lot for themselves... They do not smell strongly of latex (normal since they are not made of Latex), they do not have a weird power to be able to wear yet they slide easily in place (again better than latex) and are also easy to take off.They are very strong (I pulled on them hard and they did not tear apart) and they are fit for food manipulation. On the other hand, pulling hard on them will stretch them around the wrists and it makes them a bit loose there. They do not cover much past the wrists.They also work with touch screens. It is at least true for my Iphone.I worked some very sticky dough with them and usually, without gloves, the dough sticks in between my fingers, get under my nails and it is a mess. I tried the gloves and it worked wonderfully. No sticky mess at all. I was able to work until the dough reached the proper consistency (I am preparing some croissants and the dough has to be just right).By the way, they are FDA approved but are not approved for medical use.So with them, you can clean your home, fill up your tank and work on greasy parts of your car, prepare some food and they won't break easily.The only thing I did not like is the first sensation while wearing them, a very squeaky feel but after a few minutes, the unpleasant feeling was gone. I have a same feeling with latex gloves...I had a choice between small and large gloves to review and although my hands are medium, I chose the large ones and it was a good thing because the large ones fits me well. So I suggest you to choose one size above your normal one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT8AGGMD0HP01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BR1J3A#wasThisHelpful","RT8AGGMD0HP01","ANW6EGY12V5XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANW6EGY12V5XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 times the recommended dose according to Wikipedia but the only side effect registered are that it may give you a nice orangish tan (similar to a high consumption of carrots).Now, according from WebMD: Some people also use it for preventing colon cancer, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.Since I am wearing contact lenses and working on a daily basis and for many hours on my computer, I figured out that taking it cannot be a bad thing.At this time, it is a bit early for me to tell if it works or not but I do not see why it should not.Now don't get me wrong, it is not going to revolutionize your view but for aging people, taking this pill is not going to be a bad thing.Just be mindful if you are already taking multi-vitamins that they may already contain some as well. In such case, I suggest you to pass on this one.Edit 10/15/15It has been a while now that I am taking this supplement every day, one pill per day as the recommended dosage on the box and to be fair, I am not seeing any benefits whatsoever.

"Since the apparition of Beats headphones, paying a high premium for headphones has become as acceptable as for smart phones. And there is a fair reason for that since the price depends much on the quality of the components. The interesting part is that although I consider Beats headphones to be extremely overrated and overpriced, a very good pair of headphones can rarely be found under at least $50.And here I am introducing the Panasonic RPHS34V which are a perfect example for my above claim.At less than $20, these are also much less than stellar. The fit, although comfortable is preventing a good seal and gone are the bass with it. It leaves the listener with very sibilant highs and quite average mediums.One may argue that the music quality is secondary to sport headsets but the pair of IEM I am using are begging to differ. Yes you can get good sonic quality as you are sweating on your treadmill or elliptical machine.There is almost no sound isolation since the buds are not made to create a seal in your ears and there is only one size fits all.The cable is very thin and gives a cheap feeling.The jack is angled (a good point).As I wrote earlier, they are quite comfortable to wear but the poor sound quality would give me a headache in less than 10mn.In conclusion: You should only consider these earbuds if you are exercising outside and wants to stay connected with your surrounding. You would also have to not be too picky of sound quality and be on a tight budget.A final note, for a similar price, you should check the Yamaha EPh-20 which for a similar price are leagues ahead in term of sound quality.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN27Z7ZHD5IOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJDB7MC#wasThisHelpful","RN27Z7ZHD5IOC","ANW6EGY12V5XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANW6EGY12V5XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However it has a few interesting points worth noting.For instance, it has a unique feature so far in the fact that both earspads can be rotated + or - 90 degrees. This is very interesting for DJs especially. For anyone else, it has little interest.Comfort wise, I find these to be quite clamping on my ears and I do not like it much now that I have been spoiled with amazingly comfortable headphones prior to this one.Sound wise, I am not impressed either. I find too much emphasis on the bass (a plague of these days) and a lack of clarity.Now one has to keep in mind that you get what you paid for but I would recommend the reference SONY MDR 7506 much more than these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KWW0753WP9S1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGY5COW#wasThisHelpful","R2KWW0753WP9S1","ANW6EGY12V5XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANW6EGY12V5XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did read pretty much everything from Louis de Bernieres, starting with Capt'ain Correlli's Mandoline and ending with Birds without Wings.What brought me to him is his sense of humor that can make me laugh out loud but also the poignant parts that he manages very well.Louis de Bernieres is always interested in telling a few peoples stories in an alternative fashion and intertwine their respective stories.This is also the case with Dust that falls from Dreams.Although I did like the book, I am not sure that it is my favorite one as the moments of humor are too few for me. The end of an era, with the first World war in the background is interesting but a bit depressing in the end.I preferred much more his Latin America saga and I would recommend to read this:The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman, SeÃ±or Vivo and the Coca Lord and The War of Don Emmanuelâ€™s Nether Parts.So in the end, if you have the book in front of you, go ahead and indulge.

I used it with my regular laundry where some T-Shirts were stained with grease spots and the grease spots were still visible after using this detergent.I tried it over a few loads and I saw absolutely no difference against the usual experience so it may actually wash the invisible dirt but I would prefer if it did a better work in cleaning the visible ones.I have to add that it is hard to find new ways to wash cleaner and better than hundreds of other produces that were supposed to do wonders before this one... Marketing has to reinvent itself to keep on selling laundry detergent...

"WiFi gaming headsets can be nice but in my view are not essential to video gaming on PC, which is the essential part of the gaming I practice. I personally use an AKG K702 65th Anniversary edition headset to play with an external microphone because I think I get the best quality and I seldom need a microphone. I tried in the past headsets that came with claims of 5.1 Ddolby  with multiple speakers incorporated in the cups and it never convinced me since our ears and brain are doing the job for a good localization. Furthermore, you need a real space diversity of transmission to experience 5.1, so to me most of it is a gimmick and the most important part is a good reproduction of sounds for the best experience.I was however given the opportunity to evaluate the Ear Force Stealth 450 Premium headset from Turtle beach and my impressions are as follow:What I like:- Fair sound on PC.- Nice microphone, removable easily.- Good looks- Good with a laptop or a console without a good sound card.- Sound volume on the right ear.- Superhuman hearing can be toggled on/off from the keyboard- Controls choices are voiced in your ears when you make changes with the buttons on the headset. For instance, if you press it once, it will tell you"" Bass Boost or Bass and Trebble boost or Neutral sound"".- 15 hours listening on one charge.- When I tested the 7.1 setup on my PC, it showed sounds really coming from different directions.What I like much less:- The External USB sound card (that acts as a WiFi Transmitter) prevents you to use the headset as usual. What I mean by that is that it has to be defined as the default output for the sound. With my standard headset, I plug it in my amp and it cuts the speakers automatically. In this case, you have to do the selection in the sound setup and I find it tedious.- As well, the USB sound card output is not very strong. I found the volume not sufficient enough for my own taste.- Comfort wise, my AKG are leagues ahead. The Ear Force are clamping in a way that make me feel that I would not stand these headsets for very long before suffering. Glasses would also not be recommended.- I tried listening to music with the music setup and the sound was much worse than with the game setup. Same thing for the movies.- Super-hearing feature confuses me. I tried it with The Witcher3 and it failed to convince me that I was gaining anything. I may have been trying it with the wrong game though...- If you already have a good soundcard, you will not be able to use it with this headset...- I used the cable to try it with my Iphone and the sound was less than impressive. It was loud but without almost any bass and there were some interference.In conclusion:You should love it if:- You hate cables- You have a laptop or a console but no PC with a good sound card.- You do not already own a good headset.- You plan on using it only indoors.Do not try it if :- You plan on using it with a good PC- You listen to lots of music outdoors.- You already have a good headset.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REHTCRVBHMOPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZC3S72I#wasThisHelpful","REHTCRVBHMOPV","ANW6EGY12V5XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANW6EGY12V5XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just received it, mounted it and went to try it outdoors.The good:- It looks great.- It is quite easy to mount.- It brakes very well.- the wheels are nice and mostly silent.- The kid loves it.- You can set the height of the handlebars very easily.- It has a stand.What I like less:- It is rated for 100Kgs and I am about that weight and when stepping on it, the board started bending in a worrisome way. In clear, I am not going to use it at all by fear of breaking it.- When deployed, the whole thing does not feel completely tight. I verified all the screws and it seems correct but still, it wobbles a bit. My kid used it and did not have any issue with it but this makes me feel unsure about the whole construction quality.In conclusion:- If it was not for the second negative point, this thing is very good!

"Key holders are ubiquitous. Everyone uses them but their technology has not improved much in years.This is until the Freekey system came around, at least for me.The use is fairly simple: You press on the small mark and the edge lifts itself for an easy insertion of the key or any ring you want.They are made of high grade stainless steel and should not bend too easily.Now for the parts I like less:- Insertion is easy but removal is not. So you may still chip your nails by trying to remove keys from it.- The smaller rings are not following the same technology and it defeats a bit the purpose since I had to attach many keys to them.- Only 3 smaller rings, if you want more, you'll pay almost the same price than for the whole item.In conclusion: I am keeping it because it makes me feel secure but the main selling part is not as good as the manufacturer pretends...","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3AYUJDY8QWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQ664H6#wasThisHelpful","R2M3AYUJDY8QWN","ANW6EGY12V5XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANW6EGY12V5XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I personally use my AKG K702 65th Anniversary edition to play or the AKG Q701. These are high quality audiophile headsets but both are lacking a microphone. I got around the issue by adding an external microphone to my configuration.However, my stepson wanted a headset that would be of high quality and include a microphone.So we started searching Amazon for the best option and when I saw that Sennheiser was selling some, I got convinced it would be a great idea to try one.Sennheiser is one of the top manufacturer of audiophile headphones, notably the HD800 which is considered to this day as maybe the best dynamic headphone in the world today. The HD 650 is another reference, more comparable to my AKG but I digress...So we picked the G4ME One and got it the next day thanks to Amazon Prime One day.I tested it immediately with some of my reference soundtests and I got bluffed. It sounds really really good! It is only when I did a side-by-side comparison that I noticed that it is somehow less precise and has some overemphasized bass when compared to the AKG K702 65th Anniversary edition.But to keep things in perspective, it is also about 1/2 cheaper...So here is what I like:- Comfortable- Sold with 2 cables, one for PC and one for MP3 player.- Excellent sound, very close to true Audiophile quality (if it was not for the more bass it presents)- Very good quality of construction.- Open back design makes you  feel that the sound is coming from speakers rather than headphones.What I like less:- The emphasis on Bass. I like headphones to be more neutral. However, this is a personal preference and many will not see it as a con.- Not very forgiving for the quality of recordings, poor recording will sound very poor.- Powerful but may benefit from a proper amplification. Interestingly, these are rated for 50 Ohms but they need about as much power as my AKG that are rated for 65 Ohms...In conclusion, I consider these cans as audiophile quality for gaming and do recommend them warmly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BM4A5YQD2UF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KK8ZLEC#wasThisHelpful","R3BM4A5YQD2UF3","ANW6EGY12V5XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANW6EGY12V5XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What's not to love about those? I am using 3 AKG headphones: 1 Q01 Quincy Jones, 1 702 Anniversary Edition and one K7XX and all 3 came with very long cables. So everytime I was using them to walk around I needed to wrap the cables around my shoulders and it really looked awkward.  Not anymore with these replacement cables. 1.2 m is the ideal lenght to go from my pocket to my ears or to use when in front of my laptop.Top notch quality (Braided cables and Gold platted connectors), very affordable price so I bought 2 immediately and I do not regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QVQ865FEIXEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KALQQJI#wasThisHelpful","R1QVQ865FEIXEH","ANW6EGY12V5XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANW6EGY12V5XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The power supply is a key component for any high level desktop. Those are quite hard to test over a short period of time since usually they either work or don't. However there are a few key points that can be evaluated from the get go and they are as follow:- Is the brand reputable? In this case, it is a resounding Yes! Corsair is excellent with Power and RAM for my experience.- How silent they are? The RM750i is very silent. I would like to add that most Power supplies are now fairly silent so this is not frankly exceptional.- Are they modulable? The option to not have all cables connected is a great plus because it removes the clutter in the tower. That's a great thing,- How much power do they deliver and is this power value reliable? 750W is plenty. It should be sufficient to provide power to the most demanding computers, including Video Cards used in SLI and quite a few hard drives. One has to keep in mind that not all the components are drawing constant power. For instance, hard drives will only draw much power when in use. It is the same for the video cards. So for most people, 750W is overkill.On the other hand,  few power suppliers are claiming peak power and not constant power so the knowledge that this unit is 80 PLUS Gold certified is another advantage.- How many cables are provided in the Box. Plenty in this case but in line with most power supplies.In conclusion:If you are a gamer and use recent video cards and hardware, the CORSAIR RM750i is perfect for you. If you are a real hardcore gamer with more than 2 video cards in SLI and lots of hard drives or older equipments that consume higher wattages, you may want to upgrade to a 850W or higher. In my case, with one Geforce 970, 6 hard drives and a bunch of USB connected items (like steering wheel), this unit delivers plenty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO8ZLDCP9PGCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPNSQTU#wasThisHelpful","RO8ZLDCP9PGCC","ANW6EGY12V5XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANW6EGY12V5XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is what a quick search on internet yields:CLA is technically a trans fat, but it is a natural type of trans fat that is found in many healthy foods like grass fed cows or dairy.Is it claimed to have many beneficial virtues and to have a positive impact on health as well as for weight loss.This is the claim made with CLA coming from eating the real food.However, CLA supplementation has been shown to cause fat loss, but the effects are small, unreliable and unlikely to make any difference in reality.There is also a risk with the dosage that could lead with health issues like diabetes or high amount of fat in the liver when taken in high dosage so the recommendation is to get the approval from your doctor before taking it.One can also experience unpleasant side effects like gas, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain...I have started using it anyway (since it is FDA approved) and I have not experienced any of this yet but neither have I seen any change in my body-fat composition (I check myself every day).

So far, nothing... It has not helped me with any weight loss or even metabolism boost whatsoever. Even worse, I have been working out, weight lifting 3 times a week and doing cardio twice a week and I have not lost any fat at all... Can I blame it on the CLA?

"As the title says it, I already own an Omron 7 serie (BP652) which I have been using since 2014 and which I verified against my doctor's office's conventional system. I was given the opportunity to review this newer model and I jumped on the occasion.Before running the comparison, let me remind you that the placement of the monitor is of utmost importance in both cases, otherwise one will read completely different numbers. The sensors of the units have to be aligned with the area where one would normally take the pulse on the wrist, about 1/2 inch below the wrist bone.Here are my findings when comparing the two:- Readings are not exactly identical between the two. The BP654 (Newer model) tends to give me higher readings than the older model by a few points. Nothing too big but it tells me that I may need to experience more about careful placement to find similar results. For instance, a reading just a minute ago for the two:- BP652: 116/76-71(HR)- BP654: 124/69-65(HR)- BP654 is completely silent as compared to BP652 that was making an inflation sound. If it was not for the inflating pressure, one could think that it does nothing.- SIze is about 1/2 of the BP652. It makes it easier to carry.- BP652 has no Bluetooth connection with any phone, unlike the BP654 that connect pretty seamlessly to my Iphone6 (after installing the app).Another way to look at it, here are the things that the BP654 does that the previous model do not:- Bluetooth connection and automatic transfer of all the readings.Here is what we have lost with the newer model:- Only one user possible. BP 652 had a guest setting.- Strap is better in the BP 652 in my opinion because the placement is quite intuitive. In comparison, the strap on BP654 will accomodate for gigantic wrists but can be inducing less precision on the placement.In conclusion:I hate it when an upgrade loses things in the process. It makes me unsure of which one I want to keep on using. Both have their pros and cons but remain high quality blood pressure monitors. If you hate tracking your data manually and will not share the unit, opt for the BP654, otherwise the BP652 is a very good option, especially if you want to share its use with someone else.Interestingly, the BP652 is currently more expensive although older than the BP654. It may just be a weird thing with Amazon pricing system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW154TYAG1BSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010H76PTU#wasThisHelpful","RW154TYAG1BSG","ANW6EGY12V5XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANW6EGY12V5XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this steering wheel while in France (Thrustmaster is a French company, previously called Guillemot and specialized in making joysticks) back in December 2012. I have been using it ever since. It is a wonderful piece of hardware. I previously owned a Logitech G27 and before that the Microsoft side winder or something like that. Every time, my driving scores have improved with the upgrades.What's to like:- Serious hardware with 3 motors and amazing quality. The pedals are made of metal alloy and extremely heavy and sturdy. The resistance of the pedals is very good and simulate those of a real car.- You can set the pedals two ways, rF1 and GT depending on your preference or room available.- The pedals are very heavy and will stay put when you drive, unlike other plastic ones that constantly slide on carpet.- The driving sensation is very good and my driving performance increased when compared to Logitech.- Excellent and strong force feedback. This thing set to the maximum FFB will get your arms sore after a while.- Stay put when attached to your desk or table and placement is not as limited as the Logitech wheels.What I like much less:- I thought I had bricked it twice while upgrading the firmware. There are some workarounds to get it back to life that are not too difficult to follow. I am by the way using it with a PC, not with a console.- Price is high.- No stick shift attached. You can still use the manual gears but you will have to use the pads behind the wheel. You can buy a very good one but for another 150 bucks...- Fan can get loud at times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R126OBENSFN21E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J6KRD6#wasThisHelpful","R126OBENSFN21E","ANW6EGY12V5XS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANW6EGY12V5XS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's a great, haunting 300-page story buried somewhere within--unfortunately there's another 300 pages of padding to wade through. I have nothing against epic-length works if the story demands it, and I love descriptive writing, but Spjut gets a bit excessive here, describing every mundane detail of the characters' lives, as well as every object within their general vicinity, and it breaks up the flow and the tension far too often to keep me totally captivated and engaged. But hidden within the pages and pages of description, there's a pretty freaky story that mixes the everyday with the mythical. I'm not very good at skim-reading through parts that don't hold my interest--I force myself to read every single word--but for those who can, there's a very good supernatural thriller here that fans of Neil Gaiman's and Clive Barker's ""hidden world""-type horror-fantasies may appreciate. For me, while there were a few scenes that will most likely haunt me for a while (such as the eerie Prologue), it was just a bit too much work to get to ""the good stuff,"" and I had to force myself to keep reading at times, though the ending made it all somewhat worth it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PX45A4Z5X9OL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054408408X#wasThisHelpful","R1PX45A4Z5X9OL","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 20 month old niece loves this doll, and can spend hours giving it water and watching it come out the other end a short time later. She may be slightly too young to play with it by herself, as it can make a bit of a mess, with water getting everywhere (she prefers to give the doll water without the diaper on, so she can actually see the water come out). Also, it only comes with one diaper, so after a couple uses, you'll have to buy more. Still, my niece has a lot of fun with it, and it can be used as a teaching tool when it comes time for potty training, by placing the doll on a training potty to encourage the child to try herself.

"I see a lot of people here didn't care for Fine's ""holier than thou"" hipster attitude, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of this book at all. In fact, it added another layer of authenticity, considering that seemingly everyone into indie (i.e. ""college"") rock at the time had a somewhat snobbish attitude (and not much has changed since).This book really brought me back to the DIY, pre-internet days of fanzines and MTV, when if you wanted to check out a new band that wasn't pushed on the radio and MTV, you had to either shell out $15 for the CD, or just go check them out live for like half the price. Fine's humorous, philosophy-laden stories of life on the road were great, and made me nostalgic for those bygone days, even if I was a little too young to fully appreciate the scene at the time.Recommended for fans of 80s and 90s underground rock, and for those who would like to vicariously experience life as a struggling musician in the 80s.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38LK6MON520S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067002659X#wasThisHelpful","R38LK6MON520S3","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Brinks door handle/lock looks really nice, and makes it really simple to open the door while your hands are full (of course, you still have to unlock the deadbolt). It's also very solidly made and secure, though the installation process requires more than a simple screwdriver. It's still not very difficult, but you will have to drill an extra hole. Not a big deal, but it means the hole will have to be filled, most likely, in the event that you ever decide to get a new door handle. Also, you must already have a door with a deadbolt, or else you'll have to drill a hole for the deadbolt as well. Still, the push/pull/rotate technology is nice and convenient, the handle is quite aesthetically pleasing and comfortable, and I doubt I'll be needing a new one anytime in the near future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EKATHAO0U7OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYRR7X8#wasThisHelpful","R3EKATHAO0U7OK","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who's ever had a flea infestation knows just how much of a hassle it can be to get rid of them. With this Black Flag Extreme Flea Killer, you can get the job done easily, without having to leave your home for hours at a time while the house gets flea-bombed. It's safe to use on carpet, baseboards, and furniture (but not smooth floors), and the earlier you catch the problem the easier it will be to take care of, as you don't want to wait til the fleas have had a chance to lay and hatch their eggs. This will still break the cycle, you'll just have a larger problem to deal with. Just point and spray the problem areas, and your house will be free of fleas in no time. Recommended for households with outdoor pets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CUREQ81EGONE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PVN1ST8#wasThisHelpful","R1CUREQ81EGONE","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This safety gate is great for wider spaces, such as hallways and stairways. It's quite sturdy, simple enough for adults to open, but requires just the right amount of force so that a child couldn't. There's nothing fancy or ornamental to it, just a nice, solid gate. Installation is pretty easy, taking about 25-30 minutes or so. It's best to have another person to help set it up and make sure it's level. Also, keep in mind that it's only 26.5"" tall, so most cats can easily jump over it.

"Middle books in trilogies have the difficult task of laying the groundwork for the final novel, making sure all the pieces are in place, while still having some sort of climax in IT as well. Not all writers are able to pull it off, as there's a tendency toward over-expanding the scope, by adding too many side-characters and side-plots in an effort to maintain reader interest after the novelty -- or ""newness"" -- of the opening volume has worn off. Sometimes this is at the expense of narrative momentum.'The Bone Tree' does fall into these traps periodically, as there were times the book felt a bit too overstuffed with plots and characters that weren't always of equal interest to me -- as is usually the case with these types of sprawling epics -- but Iles successfully pulls it off in the end, imo. It does start to slow down a bit in the middle, weighed down by the constant shifting back and forth between settings (just as I'd be getting into a reading groove with a certain character), but toward the end it picks up in intensity to the point that I was immediately ready to begin reading the final installment, and it's going to be difficult to wait a year or more.But, as a fan of the notoriously ponderous George RR Martin, I'm just grateful that the conclusion will actually be here in the near future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N12YIPFLAYCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062311115#wasThisHelpful","R1N12YIPFLAYCJ","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Thomas the Train toy (so I take it he's not ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" any more?) is perfect for toddlers who have recently learned to walk. And if they haven't learned to walk yet, the handle comes off so it can be pushed around while crawling. My 20 month-old niece loves running around with it, and I constantly have to hover over her and tell her to slow down. About the only thing I wish were different would be the amount of balls within the clear plastic bubble. As it is, there are only a handful, so they only *pop* every few seconds or so, and sometimes not for a longer time. With a couple more balls they would probably pop more often.

"Drawing directly from Ed Shames, the last surviving Easy Company officer, 'Airborne' richly details his experiences in WW II, giving readers an in-depth account of his training at Camp Toccoa, the Normandy beach landings, various battles in Germany and Holland, and more, including a great story about Shames snagging a bottle of Hitler's cognac while at Eagle's Nest. The book focuses mostly on Shames' perspective in all this which, while narrowing the focus somewhat, creates a much more intimate and personal story.It's very moving at times, and even though I could never imagine going through what these guys did, author Ian Gardner does a very good job capturing what it would be like in the middle of a war zone. I didn't think my respect for military vets could get much higher, but I was wrong. The book touches on things not covered in the TV miniseries, so it makes a good companion piece to the show, and I for one highly recommend it to WW II buffs, history aficionados in general, and people just looking for an excellent story, one that just so happens to be true .","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8LFQA1296INQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472804856#wasThisHelpful","R8LFQA1296INQ","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's still quite functional, with an adjustable cord and swivels on the handles to keep it from getting all twisted up, and the lightness of it allows for very fast rotations, but it's a little clumsy and shoddy-looking due to the kinks.

"My 19-month-old niece loves this, though I agree with other reviewers here who say that those much older than 3 probably will not get as much out of it. It allows young toddlers to use their imagination, and learn the names of various animals while having fun. The different rooms for each animal teaches them to remember where each one goes, matching up the animal with the picture in the room. My niece has been playing with this toy for well over a month now, and shows no signs of tiring of it. She especially likes dropping them though the top of the silo so they come crashing down. She thinks that's just hilarious for some reason. As a bonus, it's also very easy to take with you wherever you go, since it folds up and has a handle.Overall, a fun, well-built toy that's perfect for toddlers under 3.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UR6032491NVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHPH4CM#wasThisHelpful","R3UR6032491NVC","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Plus she's still too young to learn about swords and skulls, at least according to her mother. She'll sit at the fridge and play dress up with them for an hour at a time sometimes, all the while naming each piece of clothing that she puts on. Of course, she needs some help with it, but I still think it's a great toy for kids younger than the advertised ""3 and up,"" just make sure you keep an eye on the smaller pieces so they don't try to put them in their mouths.

"I've used Frontline for years on my cat, and the one time I didn't (I used Sergeant's Gold instead), my cat had a severe reaction that caused him to twitch and breathe heavily...even growl, which I've never heard him do, before or since. I ended up having to take him to the emergency vet, and I felt really bad for a long time for trying to save a few bucks. So I was a bit apprehensive about going with a brand other than Frontline, but I'm happy to report that with Sentry Fiproguard, my cat didn't even really notice that I was putting it on, and was fine for the rest of the day. I did catch him trying to lick at the spot a couple times, so make sure you put it between the shoulder blades where they can't get at it.

"This Munchkin Auto-Close Safety Gate was very simple to setup, taking only about 5 minutes or so. The instructions aren't very good, but for the most part it's not hard to figure out. There are two extenders on the sides that allow you to fit it to various-sized doorways. It's very easy for adults and older kids to work the handle, but it's definitely toddler proof. Also, the auto-close feature comes in handy if you have forgetful family members who don't remember to close it. The gate is quite aesthetically pleasing as well, with nice, sturdy wood that goes well with the metal, and just looks nicer than some of the other safety gates I've used, some of which can be a little bit of an eyesore.

"As a fan of William Hjortsberg's 1978 horror-hardboiled mashup 'Falling Angel,' I couldn't wait to read his return to noir, 'Manana: A Novel.' This time there's no supernatural element, but it's plenty intense, taking you to late 60s Mexico, and into the shoes of a hippie from the states who may or may not have just killed a prostitute during a drug-induced blackout at a party in Mexico. All he knows is he woke up next to her, and she was already dead. Tod is definitely out of his element here, as he's normally just a laid-back stoner, and now is wanted for murder and associating with hardened criminals in order to find his missing wife, who was at the aforementioned deadly party.There are plenty of moments of levity throughout, including one or two laugh-out-loud moments, such as a scene early on where Tod, out and about while looking for his wife, somehow ends up in a knife fight with some hardened Mexican gangbangers. His thought process throughout this is hilarious even though, as a reader, you're scared for him at the same time.Mostly, though, 'Manana' is a straight-up, no-frills, fast-paced thriller, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns along the way, and with lots of memorable characters, mostly small-time ex-cons, including one who reminded me of a gangster version of The Dude, from The Big Lebowski. It's a page-turner that rarely lets you up for air, and one I recommend whole-heartedly to those who think that a mix of Kerouac and Chandler sounds like fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TN8ZD6ICB6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497680735#wasThisHelpful","R16TN8ZD6ICB6F","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A novel, treatise, an essay, a report, a manifesto, a confession."" All of these words are displayed on the cover of 'Satin Island,' and all are crossed out except for ""a novel,"" though any of those subtitles would do. It's pretty much all of those things, and yet unlike any novel I've ever read.The story, insofar as I can tell, follows U., our narrator, a ""corporate anthropologist"" who is tasked with writing 'The Great Report,' an essay that attempts to capture the zeitgeist of our times. We the reader are inside his head as one thought or idea morphs into another, with constant digressions and side-digressions within digressions. It's seemingly very free-wheeling, very stream-of-consciousness, yet meticulously structured.U. (or McCarthy) comes up with some very cool ideas and concepts, making 'Satin Island' very much a novel of ideas, one that more adventurous readers should definitely check out. The book may be very postmodern, and hard for myself and others to describe, but it's quite easy -- and fun -- to read.

"I have to admit it took me a few days to get used to it, but I now believe it's the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept in. My lower back used to always be a little sore in the mornings, but that's a thing of the past. It's firm yet soft (if that makes sense) and you can even move around and shift positions without disturbing your significant other at all, which is a nice bonus. It's cool to the touch as well, and stays cool even where you're laying.The mattress comes heavily compressed and rolled up. It's rather heavy, so make sure you place it near your sleeping area before you cut off the wrapping, as it will immediately start to unroll and decompress. It takes about 12-14 hours or so to get to it's full size, so if you unroll it in the morning, it will be ready to sleep on by bedtime. Just be warned that there is a weird rubbery smell that takes about a day or two to go away. It didn't bother me, however, but I see that other reviewers here are more sensitive to smells than me.Overall, this is the best mattress I've ever slept in, and recommend it with no reservations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14HYL39ZO14AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWM8YD6#wasThisHelpful","R14HYL39ZO14AJ","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's also great for propping up against for night-reading, offering both support and comfort.

"As a fan of David Mitchell's more mind-bending, fantastical works, and that sort of fiction in general, I could not wait to get my hands on this book. For weeks before it's release, I thought about it almost constantly, not able to focus on what I was reading at the time. Of course, it'd be difficult for anything to live up to that much anticipation, but 'The Bone Clocks' nearly did. The only problem was that the fantasy elements are what didn't quite work for me. They never really gelled with the more realistic sections, and I wasn't able to totally suspend my disbelief in the same way as I had with 'Cloud Atlas' or 'Ghostwritten.'No one, however, can argue with the fact that Mitchell's prose is beautiful and flowing, with a way of completely drawing the reader in. In my case, I was so captivated that I forgot I was even reading at times, especially in the earlier parts concerning teenage Holly and her adventures away from home. Later, when the magical elements become more and more prevalent, I was sometimes pulled out the total immersion, as those sections seemed a little out of place, and at times even silly, imo, though Mitchell's vision of an oil-depleted future in the later chapters is fascinating. It's almost as if two entirely different novels were crammed together. Of course, these disparate elements are part of what myself and others loved about 'Cloud Atlas,' but here it just didn't quite work as well for me. That could be more my failing, however, and less Mitchell's.Overall, still highly recommended, as a middling book by David Mitchell is still better than most authors at their very best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMJ5AP7ZO0NT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400065674#wasThisHelpful","R1BMJ5AP7ZO0NT","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been the type of person who gets slight anxiety ""attacks,"" where my heart starts racing and I get sort of shaky, even if there's nothing consciously bothering me at the time. This Muse headband, after just ten days of use, is already starting to reprogram my brain, allowing me to live a calmer, more relaxed life, and not over-analyze everything all the time. At first, I treated it almost like a game, seeing how well I can do at training my brain to just chill. The more cluttered and distracted your mind is, the more windy the sounds get, with loud, crashing waves. It was actually pretty fun, and addictive.After a while, the experience of doing these exercises can be drawn upon in your everyday life, even when you don't have access to the headband. It seems to even help with my concentration, as at times it can be hard for me to just clear my mind and read a book or study for a class if there's too many other things I'm worrying about. Now I have less trouble clearing my thoughts and focusing. The only negative I can think of is that it took me a really long time to calibrate it, which was a little frustrating, as I was like, ""This is calming?!?,"" but I read another review here that said that long hair seems to affect it some. After I finally got it calibrated (without having to shave my head), it's worked wonderfully.I'm not quite ready to call it a miracle cure for anxiety and concentration problems after only ten days, but as someone who thought this was possibly just a gimmick, I'm very happy with it so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G408VUK3A1VL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LOQR37C#wasThisHelpful","R2G408VUK3A1VL","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She's slowly learning how to stack them herself, but for now she just enjoys watching the waterfall, ""assisting"" me with the building process, and playing with the individual pieces, ""talking"" to them like they're her friends. This toy should be perfect for her in a few months when her coordination is better.

"Of course, the second part of this duology needs to live up to the staggering promise of the first for the above to become a reality, but so far, so very good.While 'The Abyss Beyond Dreams' is technically the seventh novel in the Commonwealth saga (which began with 2002's 'Misspent Youth'), it still makes for a more-than-suitable entry point into the universe, as Hamilton does an excellent job getting the reader up to speed on all the future-tech and lingo, the history of the Commonwealth, and the nature of the mysterious Void, a black hole-like spatial anomaly about which not much at all is known, other than the fact that it's expanding, and that an ancient race known as the Raiel have been guarding it for a million years. Past expeditions into the Void by the Raiel have failed, as none have ever returned.All the background exposition is seamlessly integrated into the story, which mostly takes place in the same time-frame as the recent Void Trilogy, though it begins a couple hundred years earlier, opening with 90 pages of pure horror. There's an eerie, ominous intensity here that's rarely equaled in modern SF (or modern horror for that matter). Science-team members aboard the giant starship Vermillion -- on a mission to found a new settlement away from the Commonwealth -- are prematurely brought out of suspension to find that the ship has somehow been sucked into the Void, even though their flight path took them nowhere within light-years of it. They don't know how this is possible, but they do know that no one's ever made it out. They soon discover that the Void is exponentially larger on the inside, like a MÃ¶bius  strip, and that basic laws of physics like temporal flow are out of whack. They also suddenly have telepathic and telekinetic powers, able to read one another's thoughts and move objects with their minds. But as fascinating as all this is to the group of scientists, things take a horrific turn when [Early, vague SPOILER] they decide to investigate a strange anomaly/organism floating in space. Suddenly their lives are turned into living nightmares, and no one can trust their crew mates, as they may not be what they seem. They may be monstrous doppelgÃ¤ngers. [End SPOILER]And that's just the opening pages of this inspired, epic novel, which then jumps ahead a couple centuries (to the time-period of the Void Trilogy), shifts from viewpoint to viewpoint, spread across thousands of light-years, and re-introduces the reader to some familiar faces, like the 1300 year-old Nigel Sheldon, possibly the single most powerful person in the Commonwealth, and the bizarre Raiel, the alien race which, with the help of Nigel, may just be ready to once again investigate the Void, due to the dreams/visions of the human prophet Inigo, and their mind-blowing implications. The world-building is exceptional, as can be expected from this author, but what really struck me was the characterization, which was surprisingly deft compared to other modern space opera writers. I cared about the fate of these characters, which isn't always the case for me, particularly in this sub-genre, due to the dissociation I sometimes feel when reading about such far-flung, alien worlds. Hamilton manages to retain the human element amidst all the techno-wizardry.Though I've read Hamilton before, this was my first Commonwealth novel, and yet never did I feel overwhelmed or lost. 'The Abyss Beyond Dreams' does a great job of familiarizing the reader with this fully-realized, immersive world, and unlike some past efforts by this author, its 600-plus pages are tightly-paced and mostly free of bloat, maintaining a high tension level and a sense of wonder throughout, a sense of wonder matched only in my experience by such classic SF novels as 'Hyperion,' 'Dune,' and Neal Stephenson's 'Anathem.'

"The Belkin QODE Thin Type Keyboard Case is very well-designed and easy to use as a keyboard for the iPad Air, with a nice, solid aluminum build that makes for a secure, sturdy case as well, while still being lightweight. The iPad automatically turns on when placed on the stand, and off when taken out, which is a plus, as is the 79 hours active battery life. The keyboard is positioned at a good angle for comfortable use, with great key placement, and large keys that are extremely easy to type on. The keyboard will also work with other iPad models including the iPad Mini, but the case will be pretty much useless. Overall, a great buy for turning your iPad Air into a convenient-to-use laptop that's sleek, light and easy to carry around without damaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322MWK91VCG4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUOCLEA#wasThisHelpful","R322MWK91VCG4R","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great case in that it provides excellent protection for your iPad Mini, while still being lightweight and attractive, and leaving the ports and buttons easily accessible, which is not the case with some others. The magnetic latch works well, turning the iPad on when opened, and off when closed, while also leaving the case tightly secured. The silicone base and stand allows you to adjust the angle of your iPad very easily, and though it doesn't lock in place, that was never an issue for me as the base's texture provides a good grip. The sleek black, textured design of the case is an added bonus. Overall, a very well-made case and an excellent value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16X1PGMS6ZQ5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHKCK0W#wasThisHelpful","R16X1PGMS6ZQ5C","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What starts out as a humorous and witty --yet pretty mundane -- story, filled with wry observations about the business traveler's life, soon turns into a surrealistic nightmare when Neil discovers that the hotel he's staying in may not be quite what it seems. The mystery of the hotel is intriguing enough to carry the reader through the pages where seemingly nothing much is happening, because it's clear that there's David Lynch/Philip K. Dick levels of weirdness underneath the surface, and the fun comes from trying to figure out just what the heck is going on. This is definitely a book you want to read in a short span -- say a week or less -- in order to maintain the eerie, unsettling mood. It lost me a couple of times early on, with pages of nothing more than observations about hotels and hotel life in general (though they were all generally amusing), but once the story kicks into high gear, there's really no going back if you're a fan of reality-bending fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JUPCCOGEXHY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006233610X#wasThisHelpful","R2JUPCCOGEXHY7","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ever since seeing Carpenter's 'The Thing' and the original 'Night of the Living Dead' as a youngster, I've never been able to resist the whole ""isolated while being hunted"" theme. I just love stories where a group of people are trapped, and have to figure out a way to survive while being slowly picked-off. If there's lots of snow, then that's an added bonus. One of the better novels in this vein recently was Ronald Malfi's 'Snow,' which is basically the same concept -- something in the snow hunting unsuspecting people -- only it took place in a snowed-in small midwestern town as opposed to a ski resort area in the mountains.The suspense was pretty well maintained here, and even when pages and pages went by of nothing much happening other than the group of friends hanging out and squabbling in a huge house in the mountains, the tension remained high, due to these chapters being occasionally inter-cut with passages of the horrors taking place nearby. My only issue was that it was hard for me to relate to the characters, as they didn't really have much depth to them. The fact that their idea of fun is quoting Adam Sandler movies and listening to Wang Chung and Huey Lewis & The News didn't help, either. So when the ""bad stuff"" starts happening, it was hard for me to really care. At times I was even rooting for their demise, never a good thing in a horror novel as far as maintaining suspense.Still, for those looking for a quick, fun read, it is a good late-night horror read, where you can feel the cold up there in the mountains and, at times, feel the terror that these unfortunate souls are experiencing. Just don't expect anything truly new or groundbreaking. I suspect, however, that Ania Ahlborne will be a name to watch in horror fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3MTSH82RE9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611099676#wasThisHelpful","R3E3MTSH82RE9G","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Aukland, New Zealand's Surf City had already proven they could master both ramshackle garage-psych and shoegazy walls of guitars on their first two releases, 2008â€²s 'Surf City EP' and 2010â€²s 'Kudos.' 'We Knew It Was Not Going To Be Like This' floats freely between these two styles, all while maintaining the influence of their kiwi pop forbears, with results that float from ""stellar"" to ""meh"" just as freely.The noisy haze of opener ""It's a Common Life"" lets the listener know right away what's in store, with the band's patented surf-infused sheets of guitars front-and-center, and melodies that are head-bobbingly catchy yet spaced-out at the same time. Davin Stoddard's lyrics -- ""Have you heard the devil's back in town, *bleep* the kids who don't know what's around"" -- implies that this is a much more jaded Surf City. They also highlight the fact that the lyrics are actually intelligible on this album, as opposed to the reverb-drenched murk of much of their previous work. So maybe the band was just as jaded before, and we just never knew.I say jaded instead of angry, as the pessimism of the lyrics throughout 'We Knew It Was...' manifests itself more as a bored indifference than anything else as far as the actual music is concerned. Good thing psych-rock isn't really a genre where something so trite as emotions would effect the quality one way or the other. It's about striking that perfect balance between catchy grooves and transcendental bliss. And on songs like the dreamy, wistful ballad ""I Want You"" and the thoroughly transportive ""What Gets Me By"" -- nine minutes of swirling, euphoric interlocking guitar melodies that closes the album -- they get it right. But too often, as on the Flying Nun-esque jangle of ""No Place to Go"" and the rather blatant Sonic Youth rip-off (or homage) ""NYC,"" Surf City comes off like a band that's just going through the motions, which isn't what I expected or hoped for after the 3-year-wait following their full-length debut.Still, if one were to cut those lesser moments, there's still something approaching half-an-hour of top-notch, fuzzed-out psych on 'We Knew It Was Not Going To Be Line This,' making it a worthwhile listen for fans of the genre. Hopefully we don't have to wait another three years to hear what's next, but there are enough treasures here to help keep us occupied in the meantime.(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZFHMJKJUYXZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CV58PJ0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZFHMJKJUYXZU","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chicago's Disappears may be the premier psychedelic noise-rock band in a city suddenly overflowing with them (seemingly overnight), but they have always been a bit of an enigma to me. Their live shows have produced in me some of the most brutally intense emotions I've ever experienced while at a concert, with the band emanating a raw, haunting energy and vigor that few acts today can match, while still completely transporting me to a zoned-out state of bliss. And yet they've never really been able to capture that visceral feeling on record, instead sounding like a neutered version of their stage self. I'd begun to accept that perhaps it just may not be possible to translate that unique aura into their studio work.While 'Era' pretty much follows the same formula as past albums -- plenty of trance-inducing motorik rhythms, droning buzzsaw guitars, and frontman Brian Case's eerie, booming vocals -- that formula is much more potent here. The three main ingredients all interweave in a way that's just as likely to transport you to a euphoric, hypnotized state as it is to scare the living heck out of you. Opener ""Girl"" provides the perfect testimony to this fact, with Case's anguished, almost tortured vocals endlessly imploring somebody or other to ""wake up, wake up, wake up"" over a relentlessly pounding rhythmic assault. I'm never quite sure whether to drift away to blissful inner-spaceland or curl up into a fetal position while listening.There's a paranoia and claustrophobia to these tracks that Disappears never quite fully embraced on past releases, as heard on the sinister-sounding lead single ""Power,"" as well as on the slow-burning, unnerving epics ""Ultra"" and ""New House,"" but not all the tracks are so dire and threatening. ""Weird House"" sounds a bit like Wire being fronted by David Byrne, two artists whose only similarities are that they both fall under the ""post-punk"" tag. In many ways, Disappears are post-punk for a new era, no pun intended. It doesn't always fully work, as on the Chicago house-infused ""Elite Typical,"" which alone would probably give the uninitiated the impression that the band was some mid-'90s British electronic-rock also-ran.Overall, however, 'Era' is an excellent fusion of post-punk song-structure, Spacemen 3-type droning atmospherics, and Krautrock beats, and whether this is the beginning of a new era for Disappears, or the end of an old one, I'd say that the band has a future that's darn bright, even if their sound is anything but.(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EIBJ1PKVGO16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAOKJDA#wasThisHelpful","R3EIBJ1PKVGO16","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"{8/22/13 Edit: After several more listens, I feel obligated to change my rating from a 4 to a 5. The album was definitely a grower for me -- My first listen already left a good impression on me, the next couple, on which this review is based, left an even better one, and now I'm starting to feel it's just-plain-brilliant. I'll let my (still rather positive) initial thoughts stand.}When I first heard, in the months leading up to the release of 'Sleeper,' that the album was rumored to be a laid-back acoustic album, my initial reaction was, ""Yeah, good one Ty."" The ridiculously prolific garage-rocker's previous two full-lengths (two of three released in 2012 alone), 'Slaughterhouse' and 'Twins,' were both in-your-face psych-punk mind-blowers -- with the former bordering on straight-up '70s-style metal at times -- yet the beautiful psych-tinged folk contained herein seems to be at the exact opposite end of the spectrum. But considering the album was recorded after a falling-out with his mother and the passing of his adoptive father, the pure, unadulterated honesty and pensive emotion of 'Sleeper' may have provided Segall some much-needed catharsis in a way that ""psych-punk mind-blowers"" couldn't.While he had occasionally flirted with this vibe earlier in his career, most notably on 2011â€²s 'Goodbye Bread,' the wistful, string-laden opening title track here lets the listener know right away that this is going to be an entirely different Ty Segall, one who's more willing to look to Love, Barrett, and even Bowie for inspiration than he is The Stooges, Jay Reatard, and 60s garage, all while somehow still sounding entirely like himself. But, in spite of the fact that he's traded in his amps-to-eleven garage-psych for graceful acoustic balladry, there have always been hints of folk and early British psych-music in even his heaviest material, so maybe all this isn't as massive of a leap for him as it initially may seem. The slow-dirge ""The Keepers"" continues in the same melancholy vein as the titular track, recalling a more eerie and ominous ""Nights in White Satin,"" without sounding dated in the least. In fact, it sounds totally fresh, and even moving, both lyrically and musically. The '60s and '70s-infused psych-folk on these tracks and others prove that Ty isn't, and never has been, a one-trick-pony.The album isn't all just reflective and mournful folk ballads, however, as the second half is as varied as they come, while still maintaining a sense of unity. ""The Man's Man"" is a hook-filled rocker...well, at least as rocking as one can get while jamming on an acoustic guitar. Segall even busts out one of his patented fuzzed-out solos near the end, 30 seconds of jagged guitar histrionics that proves a solo doesn't have to be epic in length to get the job done. This song, along with the old-school delta blues of ""6th Street"" and the country-western twang of ""The West""- a song in which the inspired lyrics dealing with Segall's late father and estranged mother transform what would have been a catchy country ditty into a song that's rather touching and heartfelt -- shows that Ty can shift from genre to genre and make them all entirely his own, with the songs never seeming disingenuous or like mere homages.Although Ty Segall likes to change things up with each and every album, and with consistently great results, I can't help but want to see him explore this direction a little further, as it shows a totally different, deeper and more thoughtful side to a songwriter and musician who seemingly has the talent to write top-tier, fuzz-filled garage-psych in his sleep. 'Sleeper' may not be a perfect album but, knowing Segall, his second attempt at a more singer-songwriter-based album might just prove to be a modern psych-folk classic.(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DDAKCZ4MS3CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8H3QTY#wasThisHelpful","R3DDAKCZ4MS3CW","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nearly every online article I've read about Brooklyn-based indie-pop duo Steel Phantoms mentions the word ""proto-punk."" Now, ""proto-punk"" is supposed to refer to the early 70â€²s punk-rock progenitors like The Stooges, MC5, and The New York Dolls. Or even bands like The Who, The Kinks, and The Creation, all of whom had the building blocks of punk in place over a decade before the Ramones released their first album. This EP sounds like none of those. Then I thought, ""Maybe those writers are all confusing proto-punk and post-punk,"" as the EP does contain some post-punk elements. But then again, most every alternative/indie band of the last thirty-plus years contains at least some elements of post-punk. Maybe the writers were just repeating what the band's press kit said. Or maybe Steel Phantoms used to sound entirely different. I'm curious as to the answer, but not enough, at this point, to go and listen to their earlier work.What this EP actually sounds like, regrettably, is the punk-pop from around the turn of the century -- affectionately referred to as ""kiddie-punk"" by some -- especially New Found Glory and Alkaline Trio. I actually had to look up a lot of those type of bands to try and find just the right comparison. And after sifting through countless online music samples of acts like Blink 182, Good Charlotte, Sum 41, etc., I finally settled on New Found Glory and Alkaline Trio. Which ruined my Amazon profile by the way, possibly for eternity, as my ""recommended for you"" section is now overwhelmed with bands like that. Now, I have nothing personal against any of those groups, but I was sick of that genre as soon as it hit, maybe even slightly before, and I wasn't really aware that there were actually bands today that look up to and are influenced by that music. In this case that includes replicating the patented yearning, emo-esque vocal stylings and soul-deadening two-chord ""hooks."" So, I guess what I'm trying to say is this: I may not be the target audience for this EP. Not just because of the genre -- which I could have looked past for reviewing purposes, because I'm a trooper -- but because there's very little here that's the least bit fresh or original, which is something of a pre-requisite for me.But for anyone interested in reliving the late 90â€²s and early 2000â€²s, or for those who may be too young to remember, but want to know exactly what it was like being an MTV-watching kid during those years (minus the obligatory boy bands, rap-metal acts, and The Real World), the 'Steel Phantoms EP' is probably as good as a time machine, and way more cost-effective. There's even a song called ""Matt LeBlanc,"" so you also get some Friends with your punk-pop, making the ""back in time"" illusion even more realistic.Too bad there are a couple of well-written, inventive semi-epics to break up the Y2K-punk love fest. The melancholy ballad, ""Overflow,"" is a languid-yet-powerful, hazy swirl of dreamy, fuzzed-out guitars, moving lyrics, and strong (dare I say beautiful?) vocals, while closing number ""Skin Tone"" is a complex, progressive, multi-sectioned anthem that sounds similar to what I'd imagine Green Day attempting to cover OK Computer-era Radiohead would sound like -- in a good way -- again with stirring vocals, and with lyrics that are rather poetic. Also, the video for lead-single ""Curtain Call"" is rather good, and makes the kiddie-punk vibe of the actual song much more bearable. Too bad it's not included with the EP.In the end, the 'Steel Phantoms EP' is a mostly derivative collection that's saved from ""total waste of time"" status by two excellent tracks. If, in the future, Steel Phantoms decide to move more toward the direction of those two aforementioned songs, you can definitely count me in. If, however, they decide that maybe it's time to start exploring some different late-90â€²s punk bands next time around, like maybe some ska-punk (which would be a significant upgrade), then I'm afraid I'll have to take a rain check.(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33SQ3UBZ9J36V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYATT8C#wasThisHelpful","R33SQ3UBZ9J36V","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems ""alternative rock"" is suddenly chic. Not only has every mildly successful Gen X-era band reformed in the past few years in an attempt to cash the big one, many pulling in crowds two or three times as large as during their heday, but more and more current indie acts are looking to '80s and '90s alt-rock for inspiration. Gun Outfit, Broken Water, Milk Music, The Family Stoned -- okay make that the entire Olympia, Washington scene -- are bringing back the sounds of SST acts like Dinosaur Jr., Meat Puppets, and Sonic Youth, while prominent garage-rockers Ty Segall and Purling Hiss have recently been adding a heavy dose of Nirvana and Mudhoney-style Seattle grunge to their psychedelia. Not to mention the nearly endless supply of shoegaze bands that are putting their spin on the walls of bendy guitars that My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive had seemingly already perfected over 20 years ago. And now, New York four-piece Bear Ceuse have released a debut that sounds, at various times, like nearly every American group from the '90s that one can think of.The French Horn-laden ""My Friends"" and the laid-back fuzz of ""All Out of A Hat"" harken back to the immediate post-grunge days of Weezer and Foo Fighters, with mellow grooves that suddenly bust out with histrionic guitar solo wizardry that would make Billy Corgan and J. Mascis proud. The alt-country vibe of ""Dixie Brothers"" could almost be mistaken for a lost song from the Ryan Adams-led Whiskytown, while ""OK LE OMA"" brings back memories of Semisonic and Fountains of Wayne. The rest of the album pretty much follows the same template, with flavors of other '90s also-rans like Matthew Sweet, Ben Folds Five, and pretty much every non-grunge U.S. alt-rock band of the '90s. However, Bear Ceuse don't totally snub British music of the era, as ""Streets of Something Good"" recreates Bends-era Radiohead worshiping acts like Travis and Muse almost perfectly. Lead singer/songwriter Cameron Matthews is even able to change his vocal timbre from song to song in order to match the particular artist each song is mimicking.Matthews' wistful, poetic lyrics and yearning vocals throughout 'Don Domestique' suit the melancholy vibe of the album perfectly, and they're probably my favorite aspects of an album that's not entirely original. I have nothing against bands that put their own spin on music's past, but the songs here seem almost like carbon copies of the aforementioned artists. It probably doesn't help that many of the groups Bear Ceuse pay tribute to were watered-down versions or earlier, better ones. Even so, I can look past a band's musical style as long as it brings something new to the mix, but this doesn't. It's too bad, really, as Bear Ceuse obviously show potential for greatness, with an ear for great hooks and meticulously-layered arrangements. Unfortunately it's not 1997, or this would have been huge.(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIAPYJTK6GZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNPG23I#wasThisHelpful","R1UIAPYJTK6GZS","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though Pond have been making their own brand of mind-altering music since 2008, these Aussies are still regarded as ""the kid brother"" of Tame Impala due to the fact that both groups are from Perth and share two members, with a third who recently quit Tame Impala to devote his full attention to Pond. And while the bands also share a penchant for putting their own spin on '60s psychedelia, Pond feature a much more diverse palette, shifting from '70s prog, to '60s garage, to Zeppelen-esque hard-rock, to T. Rex-style boogie with ease. 'Hobo Rocket,' the band's fifth full-length, may not bring them fully out of the shadow of their big brother, but it does make a strong case for Pond being one of the premier psych-rock bands out there today.Most of the songs here contain multi-parted, almost prog-like song structures. Opener ""Whatever Happened to the Million Head Collide?"" begins with a couple minutes of swirling atmospherics, shuffling rhythms, and mystical lyrics before erupting with head-banging, ""Kashmir""-like guitar riffs that are both heavy and transportive, with Nick Allbrook perfectly capturing Jimmy Page's patented fuzzed-out guitar tone. The intertwining piano, horn-like sounds, and hallucinatory effects keep it from ever sounding like a mere homage, however. ""Xanman"" and ""Giant Tortoise"" follow similar Led Zeppelin-on-hallucinogens-type formulas, and to great effect, the latter perhaps being the best all-out rock song in Pond's five year history, filled with classic rock guitar solo wizardry and flanger effects galore, to the point that it may send you off into a euphoric, hypnotized state even though you can't keep from bobbing your head up and down.The album switches things up with ""O Dharma,"" a languid, beautiful folk ballad that slowly introduces more and more tripped-out effects and intertwining melodies until the song becomes an entirely different musical experience by the end, much more prog than folk, proving Pond aren't just a one trick pony. Closer ""Midnight Mass (At the Market Street Payphone)"" begins with two minutes of heavy Sabbath riffs before morphing into an ambient, Floyd-ian soundscape, ending 'Hobo Rocket' much as it began, and providing an excellent coda to this psych-rock gem of an album, an album that proves that Pond aren't just ""a Tame Impala side-project,"" but are their own band, one that's every bit as adventurous. They somehow are able to make the old and dated sound entirely new, and entirely excellent.(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29XX4EZMYPG0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBV21KW#wasThisHelpful","R29XX4EZMYPG0G","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jerred Gummere had already made a name for himself fronting the insanely catchy, influential Chicago garage-rockers The Ponys, and now with Bare Mutants he shifts from the frantic, psych-tinged noise-rock of his previous band to down-tempo, laid-back dream-pop that's every bit as catchy and even more tripped-out, sounding like 50s music you can slow dance to, only with a foggy, atmospheric sheen over everything that gives 'The Affliction' a sound that's both catchy and hypnotic.Opener ""Without You"" sets the template: steady, languid rhythms; fuzzed-out, two-chord riffs; and droning organ, with Gummere's deep, commanding vocals upfront in the mix, giving the songs a powerful presence that many similar-minded psych and shoegaze-type bands are lacking. While nearly all the songs follow this same formula at first, most eventually morph into heavy rockers, providing an almost euphoric release after the slow, steady buildups.One can almost picture teenagers slow dancing to the girl group-inspired sounds of both ""The Fire In Your Hands"" and ""Crying With Bob"" at some sort of high school dance in the late 50s, but in an alternate-dimension, David Lynchian late 50s, due to the eerie, strung-out vibe of the songs. Also, the lyrics on the latter about how ""life took a dump on me today"" probably wouldn't have gone over well back in the real late 50s. ""I Suck At Life"" sails along at a similarly narcotic clip, until a great, histrionic guitar solo comes busting through the mix out of nowhere, snapping the listener out of their hypnotized stupor.Not every song is so morose. Bare Mutants organist and backup vocalist Jeanine O' Toole (Also of The 1900s) sings lead on ""Nothing Is Gold,"" a song that switches back and forth between sing-along kids' song and old-school country-western, while ""C*nt,"" in spite of its name, is a fun, upbeat rocker with beautiful boy-girl harmonies and guitar riffs that sound like they came straight from early American rock and roll. Songs like these and the breezy ""na na na""-chorused closer, ""Scars,"" give 'The Affliction' a variety that the languidness of its first several songs never hinted at, and makes for an album for both fans of psych-rock and fans of just-plain-great songwriting.(Also reviewed by me for Earbuddy.net)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPPO0MZMIB2V6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DH78K9G#wasThisHelpful","RPPO0MZMIB2V6","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Considering the fact that, prior to the recording of 'The Light On', Bad Cop guitarist Alex Hartness was pronounced dead following a drug overdose, this EP almost never came to be. At least, it would have sounded a lot different without Hartness's fuzzed-out guitar crunch, a sound that recalls T. Rex, and in turn the T. Rex-infused garage of early Smith Westerns. And much like Smith Westerns, this Nashville band have proven quite capable of creating catchy, '70s glam-infused garage-rock.Opener ""The Wind"" sets the tone pretty quickly with carefree, energetic vocals over laser beam guitars and a propulsive rhythm that rumbles ahead full bore from beginning to end, bringing to mind MGMT at their very best without ever sounding like a mere rip-off. ""Can't Get Enough"" could almost be a cover of a song by some '50s crooner, only changed to be fun and up-tempo rockabilly, and with wobbly guitar atmospherics that make for a listen that's both lively and dreamy. ""Post McDonalds Punks"" is a furious 2-minute blast of straight-up, ramshackle garage-punk, while the laid-back, mid-tempo groove of the tripped-out ""My Dying Days"" harkens back to the mid-90s psychedelic Brit-pop of bands like Super Furry Animals and Supergrass, again without ever sounding too similar. There's a good chance the guys in Bad Cop are too young to have even heard those bands, anyway.The title track is undoubtedly the centerpiece of this EP, and the most emotionally affecting track here, with singer Adam Moult vividly recounting the night he witnessed his guitarist's near-fatal overdose, with lyrics imploring Hartness not to die over an eerie carnival-sounding organ and Hartness's own spacey guitar effects. While listening to just the instrumentation, it's easy to assume it's another loose and fun, ""good times"" song, but when combined with the deadly serious lyrics, the effect is rather haunting. It's a song that proves that there's more to Bad Cop than just being the latest in a long line of glam-influenced garage acts. They're actually quite diverse as well, shifting from punk, to fuzzed-out dreaminess, to straight-up glam boogie at the drop of a hat. They may not have an entirely unique sound, but when it's this infectious and just-plain-fun, it's tough to complain.(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P0ZBZPM85Q3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQC1C5Q#wasThisHelpful","R3P0ZBZPM85Q3H","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prior to the release of The Mallard's 'Finding Meaning in Deference,' the group's brainchild, Greer McGettrick, announced that this album would be their last. Considering the fact that she sang and played all the instruments on 2012's excellent 'Yes On Blood,' it didn't seem to me to be that big of a big deal since she IS The Mallard, and whatever project she decides to take on next will still have the same mastermind behind it. Its too bad this album is the product of an actual band, making for an infuriating listen--infuriating because it's one of the best, most haunting and intense psych albums I've heard in recent memory.Whereas 'Yes On Blood' was a nearly 50-50 blend of mid-late 60s garage-psych and early British post-punk, 'Finding Meaning' leans much more heavily toward the post-punk end of the spectrum, especially the eerie, minimalist style associated with bands like Wire and the late 70s Factory Records acts: driving, repetitious rhythms plus driving, repetitious melodies, only with spacey background atmospherics that slowly intertwine with the main hook, which makes this dark, haunting album an experience that's head-bobbingly catchy yet trance-inducing and hallucinatory.The noisy soundscapes of 'White Light/White Heat'-era Velvet Underground are also key touchstones throughout, especially on the perfect VU/Joy Divison fusion of 'Math' and the experimental, fuzzed-out mini-epic 'Iceberg,' a tripped-out mind-blower filled with McGettrick's freaky, hypnotic mantra-like vocals and lyrics backed by a propulsive rhythm and sheets of buzzsaw guitars that nearly bore into the listener's skull. It ends this hauntingly gorgeous album on a hauntingly gorgeous note, a note that's totally enveloping.'Finding Meaning In Deference' is a powerful closing statement from a band that, though its life was cut short while still in its infancy, is one that has left a significant mark in the worlds of garage-psych, post-punk, and noise-rock. Swan songs don't really get any better than this. My only remaining question is this: ""Is it too early to hope for a reunion?""(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UWL2SUDF46HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DFBVKNC#wasThisHelpful","R3UWL2SUDF46HA","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When one of the biggest rock stars of the past 20 years basically states that the future of rock and roll rests on your shoulders, you may consider that a hell of a lot to live up to, especially when the statement is made well before you've even released your first album. Noel Gallagher obviously must have been a big fan of Britain's ""Madchester"" scene of the late 80's and early 90's, as Jono Ma and Gabriel Winterfield of Aussie duo Jagwar Ma have got the 60's-ish psychedelic pop/acid-house dance fusion of The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays down pat on 'Howlin', but with enough new twists to mostly keep it from ever sounding like a mere homage. They may not be the saviors of rock and roll -- at least not yet -- but unlike Mr. Gallagher, I'm not going to hold that against them here, as the album has more than a handful of hypnotic, head-bobbing grooves that seem made for the summer.""What Love"" immediately sets the tone with deep, throbbing beats and repeating, mantra-like vocals that are slowly joined by more and more trance-inducing effects as the song goes on, making for a song that you can either dance to or trip-out to. While this track may set the tone, it's anything but par for the course, as Jagwar Ma are seemingly able to shift musical gears in less time than it took me to type this sentence. For example, ""The Throw"" is an epic, adventurous acid-house journey that brings to mind 'Screamadelica'-era Primal Scream, slowly building and building with a kaleidoscopic swirl of synths that weave in and out of the tribal rhythms to the point that it's nearly overwhelming, while their 2011 single ""Come Save Me"" (included here) looks to the mid-late 60's psychedelia of bands like The Beach Boys and The Beatles, with its synth effects and stuttering electronic beats used to accentuate rather than dominate the song. There are only a couple instances on the album where the band's influences become more than just launching pads, nearly approaching ""Stone Roses cover-band"" territory on ""Man I Need,"" which almost sounds like it could be an outtake from the Roses' now legendary 1989 self-titled album, complete with similar 'Revolver'-esque backwards guitar-effects. Of course, lyrics about resurrection certainly don't help, and -- though it's certainly not his fault -- neither does the fact that Winterfield's nonchalant vocals are reminiscent of Ian Brown's at times.Still, 'Howlin' is stuffed with excellent danceable-yet tripped-out grooves, with a ""good times"" atmosphere that's refreshing in an age where many electronic acts are afraid to wipe off their serious face and just let go and have fun. Jagwar Ma's sound here may not be as revolutionary as it was in 1989, but that doesn't make it any less of a euphoric listening experience. It's hard to believe that the multi-layered arrangements here are from a debut album, and that can only mean great things for this band's future.(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA2A2QIE0YAQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2DLXHQ#wasThisHelpful","RA2A2QIE0YAQ3","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sic Alps' excellent self-titled sophomore LP from last year found the band cleaning up their rough edges with a more melodic, Beatles-esque psych sound that was heavy on the catchy hooks, but low on the garage fuzz of previous releases. The 'She's On Top' EP retains some of the poppier vibe of that album while bringing back the noise, and really doesn't sound like anything they've released to this point.The songs here actually share more in common with 70's rock than the mid-60's garage and British psych that Sic Alps are mostly known for, sounding like a hybrid of Big Star/Cheap Trick-style power-pop and David Bowie/T. Rex-style glam, with grooves that are more likely to make you want to dance than trip-out to. Huge hooks and swagger-filled vocals gives the EP much more of a ""party vibe"" than I'd ever expect from this band. We even get some ""sha la la"" choruses on ""Biz Bang,"" not to mention histrionic guitar soloing that would have made Mick Ronson proud. Yet it all sounds entirely fresh and new.Sic Alps--in just a handful of years--have proven they aren't just a one-trick pony, 'Nuggets'-style garage-psych band. They've already shown they can put their own spin on the British Invasion, and make it sound natural and sincere as opposed to pure posturing. Now they tackle 70's power-pop and glam and make it sound just as genuine. If this EP is a sign of things to come, you can certainly count me in. But knowing this band, there probably won't be a trace of these genres in 6 months time.But it will still probably sound like Sic Alps, and that's a pretty rare feat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9J8S8LFSTTW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUPSYEM#wasThisHelpful","R9J8S8LFSTTW1","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the more under-appreciated musical artists of the past 30 years, singer/guitarist Thalia Zedek had already earned her rock and roll stripes with no wave-inspired acts like Uzi and Live Skull in the mid-late 80's before forming Come in 1990, shifting from the experimental, Sonic Youth-esque art-punk sounds of those previous bands to a slowed-down, heavy and sludgy deconstruction of the blues. While many would cite their 1994 sophomore effort, 'Don't Ask Don't Tell,' as their masterpiece, '92's 'Eleven: Eleven' is the one I return to most often, as it was unlike anything I'd ever heard then, and even in the 20-plus years since, the intensity and emotional resonance has rarely been equaled. And now it has pristine sound to match.Zedek's patented damaged, tortured vocals (a vocal-style Courtney Love would soon become synonymous with), when combined with the crushing riffs, gives these songs an almost cathartic quality, especially when they suddenly morph from languid, dreamy slowcore to all-out, blues-infected hard rock bordering on metal. The darkness and dreariness that pervades the music and lyrics never feels like its pure posturing, or forced, and rarely crosses into despair: Thalia Zedek was--and seemingly still is--just genuinely...well, dark. Even downright hostile at times. The listener feels what she's feeling--there's really no choice in the matter--and the result is a visceral, powerful listen.Of course, none of this is possible without a band behind her capable of matching her fervor. The group's rejection of the normal lead guitar/rhythm guitar setup makes for a style where both Zedek's and Chris Brokaw's (Codeine) guitars are constantly snaking around each other, sending the listener somewhere between completely hypnotized and total headbanging mode, especially when you add Sean O'Brien's throbbing bass and Arthur Johnson's relentless, pummeling drums into the mix. Just listen to the slow-creeping, slide-guitar-infused ""Off to One Side""-- which lulls the listener into a blissful dream-like state for three minutes before erupting into an ""amps to 11,"" angst-filled skull-crusher the rest of the way, without losing either the slide guitar or the dreaminess--and you'll see what I mean.The sound-quality here is stellar, with none of the clipping (i.e. digital distortion) or loss of loud/quiet dynamics so common among reissues these days--as far as I can tell, at least--even though the volume is a tad louder. There's a little more ""oomph"" in the bass, which is especially obvious when listening on a decent stereo, though even through iPod headphones it's hard to miss, as the rumbling bass sometimes obscures the other instruments when the equalizer's on the normal ""rock"" mode (at least on my super-old iPod). But that's easily adjustable, and I'd rather have too much bass than too little. There also seems to be slightly more clarity and separation of instruments, and sounds great even though I'm normally a fan of walls of sounds that blend together. But here the clarity allows the listener to truly appreciate the impressive inter-weaving guitar and overall band dynamics on display, so I'm definitely not complaining.Besides the remastered sound of the main disc (which includes both sides of the 'Fast Piss Blues 7""' not found on the original LP and cassette), there's an excellent live recording from 1992 that--although the sound-quality is very good for a 20-plus year-old live recording--doesn't have quite the same power as the studio recordings, yet still sounds as good as many modern indie-garage bands' studio output. It also allows listeners to hear songs that were only ever available on singles, such as ""Car,"" ""Last Mistake,"" and ""SVK,"" all three of which are well worth hearing for those who haven't.All told, the 20th anniversary set of 'Eleven: Eleven' is absolutely essential, not only for fans of Thalia Zedek and Come, but for all open-minded music fans interested in hearing one of the great-yet-forgotten bands of the 90's. This is music you can rock out to, or strap the headphones on and zone out to. Hopefully this reissue will introduce a whole new generation to Come, and the band can finally stop being referred to as ""underrated"" or ""forgotten.""Better late than never.(Also reviewed by me for Earbuddy.net)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM1GA3MOBY2ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSWMLEW#wasThisHelpful","RM1GA3MOBY2ZA","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With their first two albums, L.A.-via-Olympia Washington's Gun Outfit put their own spin on the rootsy proto-grunge of SST Records acts of the mid-late 80â€²s like Dinosaur Jr. and Meat Puppets, and to excellent effect. 'Hard Coming Down' retains much of that sound (a sound that has since become popular with fellow Olympians Milk Music and The Family Stoned) only now it's hazier and more languid, bringing to mind a more strung-out version of Neil Young in some songs, and the country/blues-on-downers feel of underrated 90â€²s bands Acetone and Red Red Meat in others, while not totally abandoning their punk roots. The result is a sublime listening experience that doesn't quite sound like anything else out there today, though Maine's Coke Weed have been giving it the old college try with their latest.The constant shifting of styles here, as well as the alternating male and female vocals that bring to mind their Olympia forbears Beat Happening, ensures that the songs never get redundant. The dreamy, blissful ""High Price to Pay"" could almost pass for a Mazzy Star or Cowboy Junkies track, with Carrie Keith's druggy, fragile vocals lulling the listener into a serene, hypnotized state. My personal favorite, ""Young Lord,"" sung in Dylan Sharp's raspy, Calvin Johnson-esque drawl, is a country-ish dream-pop gem, with laid-back, head-bobbin' grooves and noodling, hypnotic leads intertwining with the sustained guitar notes perfectly. Keith and Sharp share all songwriting, vocals, and lead guitar work, so it's impossible to tell who did what in these songs (besides the singing, of course).Despite the album maintaining a sort of weary ""slacker vibe"" throughout, it never approaches total gloominess. The lyrics are smart and well thought-out, even poetic, broaching topics ranging from personal (""My Love is Wanting Me""), to existential (""Young Lord""), to societal (""Another Human Being""), sometimes all within the same song (""Lau Blues""). The combination of the top-notch lyrics and the dreamy, roots-infused textures makes for a listening experience that's cerebral, yet at times capable of whisking the listener away to a wistful dream-like state where no thought is required, as evidenced by the hazy Appalachian folk of ""Fools Gold.""'Hard Coming Down' finds Gun Outfit really coming into their own as original artists, with a sad, almost slowcore sound with occasional bursts of their original punk-infused SST sounds. They've gone from a band I'd respected at arms length to one that, as a fan of dreamy and tripped-out music, I can't stop listening to, giving me a new appreciation of their earlier work. Even if you didn't care for (or never heard) Gun Outfit before, I recommend all like-minded music fans giving this a go. You just may find yourself feeling the exact same way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RQJVW86VFM9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCLDA6C#wasThisHelpful","R3RQJVW86VFM9H","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This debut album from Holland's Mozes and the Firstborn passed me by when it was initially released a couple months back. I had sampled a couple tracks on Bandcamp, and when nothing stood out after a minute or two, I moved on. There's just so much music out there that it's impossible to give a proper listen to all the dozens of new garage bands seemingly popping up every week. Well, I sure am glad I ran into an article on these guys the other day, causing me to give the album another shot, as it's a top-notch collection of simple, laid-back, somewhat ramshackle (in a good way) garage-pop.The closest comparison I can come up with is the sloppy-yet-sublime bluesey garage-rock of Nashville's Natural Child and Austin's The Strange Boys, in that the album's filled with similarly loose, melodic, good-time vibes that harkens back to 60s and 70s garage, but without being pure revivalism. Songs like ""Peter Jr,"" ""I Got Skills,"" and ""Gimme Some"" are nearly impossible to not bob your smiling head to the mellow, Stonesy grooves and ""no worries"" lyrics.The album moves into more psychedelic territory occasionally, and is at it's most tripped-out on ""Party Crasher,"" which settles into a nice, slow hypnotic groove and slowly introduces some acidy lead-guitar noodling before really taking off into the stratosphere. Unfortunately, the song fades out a little too soon for my liking, but then I'm the type who, when a band gets into a nice groove, wants it to go on forever. The languid ""Heaven Reprise"" ends the album on a perfectly serene and spaced-out note.If this album is any indication, Mozes and the Firstborn are certainly a band to keep an eye on, especially for fans of garage. The music has a timeless quality about it. It would have sounded good 40 years ago and will sound equally as good 40 years from now. It's not even really my normal style of music, but there's no denying this band's talent for creating pure, unadulterated garage rock.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WUZ5LDZFX3V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRV0HZY#wasThisHelpful","R1WUZ5LDZFX3V7","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Sydney band's Bandcamp page describes the Black Springs sound as ""shiny, spiraling, multi coloured and wildly undulating sonic vibrations of gooey lo-fi psychedelic sun drenched country tinged barnyard indie/surf/60s caveman garage rock with delicate lashings of lofty droning pretty dream alt-post neo.... something."" I really have nothing to add.But I will anyway. Picture 90's-era Brian Jonestown Massacre's ramshackle 60's revivalist vibe, but with hazy swirls of sound and faint, Spacemen 3-type droning atmospherics that soon worm their way into your brain, and with some nice bright harmonies to boot. It's similar in a lot of ways to the BJM-meets-shoegaze sounds of both The Asteroid #4 (circa 'These Flowers of Ours') and Anton Newcombe's semi-recent label signees Magic Castles, in that it's easy to latch onto the catchy, jangly-yet-hazy melodies and nice harmonies--as well as the good-time vibes--but before long you're in innerspaceland without ever realizing you were being transported. But unlike Magic Castles, the production here is crisp, with actual discernible lyrics, pounding, powerful drums, and less murkiness overall.The 'Sunrise' EP settles into a mellow hypnotic groove right away with the title track, and slowly gains in intensity over the length of the album. Much of it brings to mind The Stone Roses as well, in that the rhythms are both danceable and capable of putting the listener into a trance, but with Black Springs' own unique sheets of intertwining guitars adding to the hypnotizing effect. As a fan of psych music, old and new, to me the EP perfectly meshes infectious hooks and headphone-journey bliss, making it suitable for whatever mood you're in. It also seems impossible to wear out, no matter how hard I've been trying to do just that these past few days.If you're a fan of any of the bands mentioned above, Flavor Crystals, Tame Impala's 'Innerspeaker,' Black Market Karma, or of mind-altering music in general--psych or shoegaze--I recommend you take the trip and see for yourself. For what it's worth, it has my unreserved recommendation, and I have a hard time imagining any similarly-minded psych fans being disappointed in the least.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYSXRBVL3K3WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJ41EPU#wasThisHelpful","RYSXRBVL3K3WR","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though commonly lumped in with the laid-back, beachy dream-pop of Real Estate, Beach Fossils, and DIIV, Wild Nothing's synth heavy sound has much more of a new wave/dance vibe about it, and the 'Empty Estate' EP continues in the direction established on their previous albums for the most part.But while 'Gemini' and 'Nocturne' maintained steadily languid and dreamy moods throughout, this release finds the band branching out in a bunch of different directions while still keeping that 80's feel, from the upbeat and vibrant, 80's Bowie-sounding ""The Body in Rainfall,"" to the New Order-style disco/dance of ""Ocean Repeating (Big-Eyed Girl),' to lush, ambient soundscapes that would do Brian Eno proud on ""Hachiko"" and the 6-minute ""On Guyot.""

"Pure X's 2011 full-length debut, 'Pleasure,' was 37 minutes of laid-back, murky psychedelia awash in reverb and droning atmospherics, with a warm and ""floaty"" vibe that made for blissful inner space journeys. And while 'Crawling Up the Stairs' retains most of that formula, it has a much darker, more intense feel to it--both musically and lyrically--making for a listen that's not quite as blissful, but one that's much more emotionally powerful.Whereas the lyrics on their debut were lost in the swirling soundscapes, here they're upfront in the mix, demanding your attention instead of providing mere background noise, and they're quite downbeat at times, even ominous, yet done in a way that's rather poetic. The overall sound here is like a cross between Galaxie 500 and Spacemen 3, only much spookier, as evidenced by the dramatic, tortured lyrics and vocals of the otherwise serene ""Someone Else"" and ""How Did You Find Me.""The album's not all darkness and despair, however, as both ""I Fear What I Feel"" and ""Thousand Year Old Child"" have an almost 60's Motown vibe, with the former even throwing in a bit of funk, which I never thought I'd say about a Pure X song after the hazy fuzz of their early EP's (as Pure Ecstasy) and album. Of course, both songs are still extremely tripped-out--filled with layered, wobbly atmospherics--as is the rest of the album. Only now there are actual hooks for the listener to latch onto, hooks that could even be described as ""catchy.""The songs here just feel more like actual ""songs,"" so while it's not quite as easy to get lost in the multi-layered depths, the combination of front-and-center lyrics and slightly more traditional song structures makes for an album that could be listened to anytime, as opposed to being saved for late-night headphone journeys. The darkness that pervades the majority of the album may infect the rest of your day, but so will the pure sonic beauty this band so effortlessly conjures up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WL8WGGGJZM3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUOWI9Q#wasThisHelpful","R2WL8WGGGJZM3E","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yet another excellent album from a Melbourne, Australia band--so what else is new? And yet, it seems not many people in the States have taken notice of the indie scene down under. Neither had I until last year, so Beaches' 2008 debut totally passed me by, meaning I can't really compare this nearly 5-years-in-the-making followup to that one. What I can tell you is that 'She Beats' is a stellar fusion of noise-rock, psych, prog, and Krautrock, all blanketed in a dreamy shoegaze haze, making for a rather hypnotic and immersive listening experience.Lead track ""Out of Mind"" lets you know right out of the gate what this all-female group has in store, with progressive lead-guitar noodling and echo-y, reverb-laden vocals surrounded by sheets of noise, and backed by propulsive motorik rhythms, all which combined to put me in a euphoria-filled trance almost immediately. The droning atmospherics and hypnotic beats of ""Keep On Breaking Through"" and ""Dune"" kept me in that state, and I pretty much stayed that way til well past the final notes of the album, the kaleidoscopic symphony of sounds still reverberating in my head.Other highlights for me include the late 80's House of Love-style dreamy proto-shoegaze of ""Send Them Away,"" the bendy walls of hazy guitars and mantra-like vocals of ""Distance,"" and the throbbing bass and swirling ocean of sound of the near-epic ""Granite Snake."" There are no real low spots, and there's much more to the album than just walls of enveloping noise--it's also filled with melodies that are extremely catchy yet entirely unique, and laserbeam lead guitar soloing that tickles the brain perfectly.'She Beats' is definitely an essential listen for fans of the noise-rock of Sonic Youth, the shoegaze of MBV and Ride, and for fans of tripped-out music in general. Beaches definitely have their own original sound, however, a sound that--while owing much to noise-rock and shoegaze bands of yore--is totally forward-thinking and fresh-sounding, and I've got to wrap this review up so I can buy their 2008 album and 2010 EP. But it'll be a while before I wear this one out, I'm sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO6S2WUZCEZUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKYD5YC#wasThisHelpful","RO6S2WUZCEZUK","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Mikal Cronin's previous work shared a lot in common with longtime partner-in-crime Ty Segall's fuzzed-out garage-psych, 'MCII' finds him shedding much of the psych and adding a heavy dose of power-pop, and to excellent effect. Mikal has always leaned towards poppier, more hook-laden territory than Segall, but this album finds him really growing into a first-rate songwriter of infectious, just-plain-catchy tunes.The fuzz hasn't been abandoned, however. Songs like ""Shout It Out"" and ""See It My Way"" will immediately shift from light, acoustic balladry to all-out, ""amps to 11"" grungy garage-rock, without ever losing the sunny-yet-wistful vibe that permeates the album. The lyrics, though dealing in the standard ""love"" and ""loves lost"" realm, are top-notch (even if a bit sugary-sweet at times), which is something of a rarity among many modern garage acts. Cronin's mastery of loud-quiet dynamics is on full display as well, recalling 90's grunge more than modern garage, as evidenced by the stellar string-laden rocker ""Change.""'MCII' might not have been the album I was expecting, or even hoping for from Mikal Cronin, but after a few listens there was really no resisting his charming, hook-heavy and harmonies-laden power pop. This album finds Cronin stepping out of Segall's shadow, proving he's an excellent songwriter in his own right. Considering he played every instrument on the album--other than the occasional blistering guitar solo from Segall--he's also an immensely talented musician, almost annoyingly so to someone like me who struggles to play even one instrument.And I have a feeling he'll be annoying more than a handful of songwriters for many years to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RME7ZHM7KFCG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOZ6Q0I#wasThisHelpful","RME7ZHM7KFCG6","A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E5GLJPQAMOBS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a really detailed set -- it has 433 pieces and, unlike many Lego sets, makes 3 different style houses.It says that it is for ages 7 and up -- this can easily be appropriate for an older child, maybe up to 10-11 years old, as it is more complicated than most Lego sets I've seen.  For one thing, the pieces fit together in more directions than Lego, so the child really has to study the picture directions to figure out if they're connecting it correctly.  It's really a great set -- building the structures and adding the details to the houses is a very educational, time-consuming and interesting process, so it won't be all over in just a half hour.  (Also nice that these don't get confused with Lego blocks that litter the house!)K'Nex will definitely be my go-to Christmas present now -- really nice quality, more like a durable 3D puzzle than a simple Lego set.  5 stars all the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGOF8UATW6RQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5Y9YNO#wasThisHelpful","RGOF8UATW6RQP","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are really cute labels, nice Kraft Brown color.  They fit perfectly on the Ball Quilted jelly jars,min that little oval.Note that these are the permanent labels, so they need to be soaked off (just like a store label would).  I find that this works better, since often the ""removable"" type don't stick as well, or pop off on the sides of smaller circumference jars.One star off because I didn't have any luck getting the template to work with my printer.  I easily found the right template, but the sheets of labels are smaller than a standard 8 1/2 x 11"" size, so I think that's where the compatibility issue may lie -- I just couldn't really get the printing to line up correctly.  I'm not too bothered by that personally, since I mostly wanted them to write on by hand, and I usually can't be bothered to use the printer for just a few jars.  I think if you really know your way around your printer settings, or maybe have a photo printer that you normally print on smaller paper with, you may have better luck.  I do like how there are only 4 labels per sheet, so you don't have to print a lot at the same time.Overall, though, very attractive labels, good quality, and they stay put.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FNF4L3IY36CL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7VEE3O#wasThisHelpful","R1FNF4L3IY36CL","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works much better than aluminum foil for melting cheese on burgers...doesn't blow away with the draft from the grill, and won't stick to the top.  I also like this for covering splattering chicken pieces on the bone...it will cover about 3 pieces of chicken, or 2 burgers.  It would be perfect if it was just an inch or two wider in diameter -- then it would cover 3 or 4 burgers at a time.It could be a little heavier/thicker grade stainless -- it does get dinged a little easily.  However, for the price it's a really good deal.  I like that the handle on top has enough space that it can be easily grabbed while wearing oven mitts -- I hate trying to wrestle things like this off the grill using tongs!  Always ends up on the ground.All in all, a good design -- I even find it coming in handy indoors on the stove.

"I first bought these in my grocery store -- I'm just a sucker sometimes for new products!  Also, there are times when I'd rather not cross transfer things between my dish sponge or cloth and a different task, such as scrubbing gross stuff off the side of the stove, floor, or washing out the dog's dish.  (Yes, I know, they have less bacteria in their mouths than we do...but that ""slime"" in the water dish still turns my stomach!!)I also needed (ok, not the right word) these to clean my bathtub -- I have an acrylic bathtub (not fiberglass), and just about no bathroom cleaning product I've ever found says specifically that it's safe for acrylic surfaces.  When I finally contacted the tub manufacturer, I found out that what I'm supposed to clean it with is simple dishwashing liquid (as long as it doesn't contain bleach).  Don't know why that never occurred to me!  Anyway, dishwashing liquid works great on the tub, dries cleanly and sparkly.  These Dawn-impregnated paper towels actually work even better than a sponge and dishwashing liquid did...they really get the tub clean, without a ton of suds to get it in the way (too many suds can make it hard to tell what's been cleaned and what hasn't sometimes).  They are tough, too -- I can keep ringing them out and they really don't tear or disintegrate mid-task.The only problem is that they always have the Dawn in them to some extent, so I still end up needing a plain towel to rinse and wipe things off at the end with just plain water.  This is the flaw in this product -- that they don't replace any product in your house, really.  You still need dishwashing liquid in a bottle (at the very least, to be able to soak things in the sink).  You still need regular paper towels, since of course with these pre-soaped towels, you can't do any soapless wipe-downs, use in a microwave, line a muffin/roll basket, windex your house or car windows, wipe your mouth, dry your hands, etc.  You'll also still probably want a Lysol wipe type product or other cleaning product to do cleaning jobs for which you want to disinfect (i.e., around the toilet bowl, fridge handle and doorknobs) or for jobs that you don't want to produce any suds (wiping off splatter from the wall, floor, etc.).  So it really becomes an extra cleaning product in your house taking up space, that might not come in as handy as you'd think...My biggest gripe about these, actually, is why do they come on a roll at all?  They don't replace your regular paper towels (which likely are on a paper towel holder), and they shouldn't be confused with paper towels, since that could be disgusting or even unhealthy (if food is microwaved all wrapped up in them, for example.).  Guests and children will assume they're normal paper towels.Also, you tend to use them next to the sink, as shown in the video -- so in roll form, they have to just sit there on the counter next to the sink.  If you need to grab a second towel, you have to pick up the towel with often wet hands to do so, which can start to activate the soap on the rest of the roll that you're holding onto in order to tear a new one off.  Also, the whole roll can easily become wet, since it's sitting on the counter where you're doing dishes -- unless you install a whole 2nd paper towel holder for just this product, of course!It would have been far more practical if they'd folded these (like individual paper towels in a school or other public bathroom) and put them into some sort of dispenser box.  That way you could easily take out one at a time, and store them anywhere.  They would also always be labelled correctly, nobody would get them confused with regular paper towels, and you could grab one out with wet hands and not have to pick up the whole thing.  You could just keep the box right next to the sink, and nobody would think that it was a roll of paper towels.So overall, while this product has some features I like, I won't be purchasing it again, at least not if they continue to make it in a roll form.  I don't want to have to keep explaining to people, ""Wait! That's not a paper towel...here, use these instead"" every time...and there's no logical place to store these where they won't get mixed up with the paper towels.For now, I have actually torn off--one by one--every towel on the roll, folded them, and I keep them in an empty garbage bag box, under the sink...it's the only way I could think of to keep these from getting confused with paper towels!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXGV4PFN9JV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYAMVTK#wasThisHelpful","R1SXGV4PFN9JV4","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This size ""small"" was EXACTLY what I wanted.  At 5x7, it's roughly the same size as an iPad Mini.  It's perfect for me to throw in my purse when I need it -- I use it all the time for everyday stuff, like shopping lists and notes/information from phone calls, etc.  It's not too big and not too small.Note the size you're getting--they make it confusing by showing a full-size notebook in the video!  They should show something to scale next to it, or somehow emphasize its smaller size as opposed to a standard notebook-paper spiral notebook.The cover is plastic and durable, it has a pen holder on the front, and the paper is decent (100 sheets).  The divider inside I was expecting to like a little more...it definitely won't fall out (like a bookmark easily could), but it actually has the opposite problem, where its a little annoying to remove and replace where you want it.  I want to keep moving it to my current page, but it usually gets too annoying to move, so I just bend the page over or use something as a bookmark.  The divider would probably be most useful if you semi-permanently wanted to separate two sections and didn't need to move it around a lot.All in all, it's really fit the bill for what I needed -- a small notebook that can fit inside any bag, glove compartment, etc., to keep miscellaneous information and shopping lists in.Oh, by the way, someone else didn't understand the point of the canvas cover over the spiral wire binding -- let me tell you, when winter hits and sweater season begins, you'll understand!

"""Signature Blend"" -- this is a pretty decent, fairly bold, medium roast coffee.  It claims to have a ""caramel"" taste to it, however, which I do not get at ALL from drinking this coffee!  I have literally no idea what they're talking about.  It must be an extremely subtle caramel!  But that's ok, I wasn't super jazzed about caramel flavored coffee anyway...These have worked perfectly in my Keurig brewer -- I've had the problem with grounds in my coffee from other ""off"" brand K-cups, but I haven't had a fail with a Cafejo one yet, so no complaints here.I would basically describe the Signature blend as similar to an Italian roast, but not as burnt/dark.  Nice and strong...I'd actually call it an ""extra bold,"" since most coffees NOT labelled that are fairly weak, in my experience.  There is a fair amount of weight to the cup as compared to non-bold K-cups, so I think there's enough coffee in there to be comparable to an extra bold (that's all extra bold means -- more coffee inside the cup).  Anyway, so I recommend this flavor if you like a bold, strong, coffee that isn't too burnt or dark roast tasting.  I think it makes for a very good wake-up coffee...and again, if you're looking for a caramel-flavored coffee, I would NOT go with this Signature blend, despite what the description says!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8Q7764UQ16DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OXY1R10#wasThisHelpful","R8Q7764UQ16DO","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was truly shocked when I opened the box -- this is NOT a ""Satin Nickel"" finish!  It looks exactly like a dull gray spray paint.  It really doesn't even look metallic...just matte gray.  I couldn't believe it -- it looks NOTHING like the pictures!It is nothing special -- it works just fine, the on/off click wheel (inline on the cord) is nice, and there are two different brightness settings.  The halogen bulb is 50 watts, and put out a decent amount of light, although it is yellowish and harsh.The adjustable arm on this lamp is not great -- although they made the base heavy, they didn't make it anywhere near heavy enough to actually hold the lamp in place when you adjust its position.  You have to use two hands whenever you want to tilt it in any direction.  It's not as flexible as I'd hoped, either -- it has a very limited range of movement for lamps like this.Overall, I don't recommend this lamp -- I don't think it's a high enough quality lamp for the price (which was around thirty bucks when I was writing this review).  The dull matte gray finish was truly disappointing and unacceptable.  A product really should look like its photo and match its description.  This is NOT ""satin nickel.""

"This would be a great curved double shower curtain rod, but it has some flaws, mainly in manufacturing/quality control.First off, the name of the rod I got was ""chrome"" -- but it is NOT chrome.  It is a satin finish.  I noticed that now, as I am leaving this review, it says that the color is satin...so why is the product called chrome?? (The product box also says ""CHROME"" in big letters on the front, so it's obviously supposed to be chrome.)  It will not coordinate with chrome bathroom fixtures, which is a shame.  Please change the product name to reflect the truth, or actually make a chrome version.The rods themselves are good quality, but some other parts aren't.  The gaskets that go between the telescoping portions of the adjustable rods do not fit properly and are the cheapest I've ever seen, so they don't stay in place, which looks really bad and makes the shower curtain not glide smoothly over the rod.  I've owned several tension rods, and this is the first time I've seen a manufacturer get that part so wrong.The end caps are too thin, so they arrive dented in a few places, and they will dent easily when being used.  They also do NOT screw on with the included hardware.  The little screw things provided to secure the end caps in place are far too short, and are basically useless.  I am currently using tape to keep them in place!There are odd-looking giant gaping holes in the end caps where the rods enter them, which you can see the black plastic base through after the product is installed...this is pretty obvious in the product photos, but somehow in person I'd imagined it would look better.  It doesn't look terrible, but the eye is definitely drawn to it, and the gaps seem far larger than necessary.  They let lots of water inside...fortunately since the end caps don't screw on, you can remove them to dry it out whenever you'd like.  ;-)There should be, as other reviewers have mentioned, a rubbery quality to the hard plastic ""pads"" that contact the wall, as with all other tension rods I've used.  No matter how tight I make it, if I bump the rod at all, it moves it, because there's nothing ""grippy"" on the ends to help keep it from sliding out of place.As for the pros...  I'm a single woman, and I was able to install it myself by following the directions carefully.  It took some time to get it into the right position, but I didn't think it was more difficult than I'd expected.  It would certainly be easier with two people, but one person can definitely install this if they measure carefully and closely follow the instructions.  The trickiest part, I thought, was adjusting the tension on each rod when it's on the wall -- the directions say to first tighten the back rod, then the front, but I found it to work much better if you keep going back and forth between the two rods, adjusting each one little by little, more and more -- that way one doesn't get way shorter or longer than the other, which would cause the rod to slip out of place somewhat.  Also, if they're not appearing to be parallel to each other, it's probably because one is tighter than the other.Anyway, so the installed double rod is generally nice, and I like the extra space it gives me in the shower.  (I put both my decorative and liner shower curtains on the same rod -- the rear one -- and use the front rod as an extra towel bar, which is very helpful in my tiny bathroom which only has room for one short towel bar on the wall.)  However, there are just a few too many quality control issues, with the ill-fitting dented end caps, the poor quality gaskets that will not stay in place where the rods telescope together, and the lack of any grippiness at all on the ends to keep the shower rod in place on the wall.  It would be a great rod if they fixed these issues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZQZW6GBRFY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92QI3K#wasThisHelpful","RSZQZW6GBRFY1","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted a diffuser to enjoy a variety of essential oils, particularly lavender at night.  The scent really helps me to sleep, but there's only so much oil one can put on one's skin before it starts to get gross, especially in the summer!This diffuser is easy to use -- it comes with a small ""pitcher"" which is the same size as the water tank inside the unit.  You simply fill up the pitcher, add 3-5 drops of essential oil, and turn it on.  The water vapor is produced by ""ultrasonic"" vibrations (not by a heating element), and a thin, steady stream of cold water vapor emerges from the top within a minute or so.  It runs almost silently.This particular oil diffuser also has an LED light...a feature which gives it the ambience of a lava lamp, with all the tackiness of a flashing fiber optic made-in-China Christmas tree.  The LED lights change color constantly every 3 seconds or so between blue, red, purple, and green (in a show I find to be annoying), though most of the diffuser still looks green throughout, because the outer housing is a lime green plastic.  It's just an odd light at the bottom that changes color (the photos are fairly accurate in is respect).  I find it to be a strange combination to have flashing lights with essential oils, which people usually use for some sort of relaxation or perhaps healing qualities...  A steady light would have been SO much better than the flashing.Seriously, the LED light component of it is pretty bad...there are 3 settings that the power button controls: Diffuser on/Lights off, a Diffuser on/Lights on, and Off.  You simply toggle between the three settings.  The problem with this system is that there is no tiny indicator light anywhere on the diffuser to indicate when the diffuser is on, but the LED lights are off...so you can't really tell if it's on unless you make the room quiet and listen very closely (the water vapor stream can be nearly impossible to see in certain lighting and backgrounds, so it often is invisible).I personally always use it with the LED lights OFF, because I get migraines that are triggered by flashing lights (and because I'm not running it in a brothel).  I just really wish they'd just put a tiny LED light somewhere on the unit just to indicate when it's ON, but the blinking LED lights are off.  The best thing to do, of course, is to just unplug the unit when not in use....but that is hard to remember to do consistently, so a light to alert you it's on would be even safer.  I may put it on a timer just to be sure it's off after a certain length of time (it says not to run it for ""an extended period of time,"" but it doesn't define what ""extended"" is...?  6 hours?  24?  Who knows!)Anyway, so overall, the diffuser works well, the oil seems to be diffused evenly and then scent is heavenly -- it even comes with a 5 ml bottle of lavender oil, which is nice.  Note that you cannot use this to inhale vapors directly (it's not something that's intended to be breathed in when you have a cold).  It is to infuse your home with the scent of essential oils, and it does that well.  It basically works ok (could be nicer, but it gets the job done), the LED light show is truly awful...but if you like flashing lights, you'll love it!  It would be great for a party or something.  I'd upgrade it to 4 stars if there was an ""on"" indicator, and if the housing was white instead of green, which would be more attractive (I'd actually hoped the green in the product photo might have been just from an LED light, but the whole top is actually green plastic).FYI, I don't think it would work well as a night light (for a child or adult), because the only setting for the lights is flashing, which would be too distracting when trying to sleep.  A soft, steadier light would be nicer, especially if you could choose one specific solid color.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZWVADSMJI9TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9OO60S#wasThisHelpful","R2ZWVADSMJI9TH","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Do you ""need"" a special towel with which to dry off your four-legged best friend?  No.  But it's really cute, and it does tend to prevent people from inadvertently using the dog's furred-up towel to dry themselves off after a walk in the rain.  :-)The paw print is embroidered on, and it's done really nicely, actually.  The black embroidery looks quite handsome against the taupe/tan towel color, and it stands out distinctively.The towel itself won't seem absorbent at all when you first get it -- as with most towels, it needs to be washed first to wash off the ""sizing"" (finishing product on fabric products that make them look nice and travel well to the store).  Wash it on hot, and don't use any fabric softener.  I think it gets most absorbent after a few washes, so I threw it in every time I did a load of laundry at first -- but it'll be noticeably more absorbent after just the first wash in hot water.The size is just right for my dog (a larger Shih Tzu, about 20 pounds).  It wouldn't be big enough for a big dog, except for just wiping off its legs and back, etc., after a walk in the rain or something.  I can mostly dry my dog after a bath (if his hair isn't long) with this, but I usually need a second towel to really do the job.  I have never found that ANY single towel will dry my dog completely anyway, I always think you need two, unless maybe you have a chihuahua or something!  (Plus, I need that extra towel anyway to dry off the 10-foot ""shake radius"" of water droplets produced, so that's hardly a deal-breaker for me!)Anyway, this is an excellent towel to keep by the door after walking your dog in the rain -- clearly marked with the paw print, it's perfect for this purpose, and it looks attractive enough to keep out all the time without looking odd.Oh, it dries pretty quickly, too -- MUCH faster than a regular bath towel.  Lightweight too, so it's great for travel -- I usually line the dog carrier with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T4OIU36M3BC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QOBTBO#wasThisHelpful","R1T4OIU36M3BC6","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I questioned whether or not an air purifier would do anything at all in my home, since a newer furnace boasts that it contains a ""whole-house air purifier"" within it.Well, clearly the furnace's ""purifier"" is missing a lot of stuff!  After using this Holmes model for a week, both the black sponge-like filter and the Hepa filter show copious amounts of dust and fine particles it has filtered out of the air.  I moved the purifier between different rooms of the house, and what I discovered is that after it ran in a particular room for 24 hours, I would notice that the room smelled as if it had been ""aired out""...I found myself checking a couple times to see if I'd left a window open in a room, forgetting the air purifier was in there.It runs quietly--no issues there.  It has 3 running speeds: low, medium, high.  The low speed is so quiet that I thought it had turned itself off.  The medium speed is so quiet that I can't hear it either if there is anything in the house making any noise at all...i.e., air conditioning, television, etc.  Even without background noise, the medium speed is quiet enough that I completely tune it out, even if it's sitting right in front of me.  The high speed is louder -- much like a white noise machine.  I actually very much like the sound of the highest speed, especially when I'm sleeping.  It is consistent and perfectly ""white"" and even, no awkward motor sounds, etc.  It's great to sleep with, and it keeps my dog from hearing another dog bark a mile away, so it's made for a pleasant and quiet summer!  :-)I am certain this air purifier is doing a great job of filtering particles out of the air, especially allergens such as pollen.  I only have mild allergy issues, but my dog has significant seasonal allergies.  It never occurred to me that my dog would benefit from filtered air, but ever since I started using this purifier, his symptoms have been significantly reduced -- I am now keeping it close to his sleeping place at night, in fact.  I think it must be filtering out the pollen he brings in on his shaggy coat, which reduces the amount he inhales, steps on, licks off his feet, gets on his belly, etc.  Great benefit I never predicted!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XESHLRH6WYFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DK35B#wasThisHelpful","R1XESHLRH6WYFE","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dimensions:Total length (tip to tip):  6 1/2""  (16.5 cm)Cord length (between tips):  4 1/2""  (11.5 cm)This 6"" cord is PERFECT for charging my iPhone with an external battery!  I have a flat rectangular external battery, which is about the size of the phone itself.  It allows me to charge my phone without an outlet, and without carrying the phone in a bulky battery case.  With the 6"" cord, I can easily hold the battery and phone together to continue using the phone while charging -- no long 4 foot cord to trip over or get tangled in my purse!It charges extremely quickly -- I think the length of the cord is directly related to the length of charging time...in other words, the longer the cord, the longer the charge time (it's why Apple doesn't give you or even sell a 6 or 10 foot long charge/sync cord).  So this 6"" cord charges even faster than the 3 foot original cord (although not a lot faster).The cord itself (gold metallic) is really attractive -- both ends are clad in a matte finished aluminum, with a durable plastic on the inside.  But the cord itself is really beautiful -- it is covered in a sleeve of closely braided gold satin thread.  It has a soft feel to it -- it is not covered by clear plastic or anything, so it actually has a fabric/cord feel to it.  I would seriously wear a bracelet made out of this cord, it's that nice!  It can get ""pulls"" in it or fray, since it is a fiber, so just make sure you don't plan to keep it near something like a Velcro strap, or similarly rough items that could snag on it.It still has plenty of strength to it -- flexibility wise, it feels slightly more flexible than a regular Belkin plastic cord, and slightly less flexible than Apple's original cord.  It feels like it'll hold up for a long time (which has been my experience with Belkin cords, they last longer than the Apple ones for me).I've had no issues with compatibility with this cord (but I have in the past with others).  One thing I read is that you should plug the cord into your other source FIRST (outlet, charger, computer, speaker, whatever), and THEN plug the cord into the iPhone itself.  That should get rid of the ""this device is not compatible"" message (for devices you know ARE compatible, of course).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y0ORQUDGIT24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTXV3ZS#wasThisHelpful","R2Y0ORQUDGIT24","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very handy wipes...love that these come in a 3 pack, so I can keep one in each car and one in the house!  The dog likes to leave nose prints on the windows in all three locations, so this makes for a quick cleanup when it gets too gross.  Previously I'd tried the flat ""packets"" with the peel-off flap to open, but those always seemed to come open and dry out before I could use half of them.These leave no noticeable lint behind like some paper towels can.  They're also not too wet, so they don't tend to streak or leave residue.  They are not, for example, nearly as wet as a Lysol wipe; Lysol wipes are more of a fully saturated wet wipe, and this is more of a ""damp"" wipe -- just what you'd normally want when cleaning glass.Only drawback is that the cans could be a little more tightly sealed...I haven't had issues with liquid leaking out, but I have had the cap open and the towels dry out, I think when there were multiple items competing for space and the can got jostled or squeezed in a little.  I now keep a little piece of scotch tape on the lid just to make sure it stays shut.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I8HGEFNDT09R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNT6BR4#wasThisHelpful","R2I8HGEFNDT09R","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Flair pens!  I write with exclusively either these (which I would call ""regular"" Flairs) or Liquid Flairs every single day.  I get severe shoulder and hand pain if I try to write with a ball point pen, and these require almost no pressure and little hand strength to write with.The tropical colors are nice -- know that about half of these colors won't be great probably to write with for ""official"" purposes, because they're too light or lower in contrast-- but they're excellent colors for drawings, emphasizing certain words, color coding, etc.I think the tips on these last a long time.  If you press really hard, they'll get larger and probably won't last as long...but you don't need to press hard at all to write with these, so if you use them nicely, they should last at least as long as other pens, probably longer.  Make sure to snap the caps on all the way.They are not permanent (they're not Sharpies), so you can't use them to write on plastic or magazine type paper, because they'll smear.  They also don't smell bad like permanent markers, and they don't tend to bleed through paper (although they will a little bit, especially with thinner paper, like newspaper or phone book type paper).  I would say you probably wouldn't want to plan to write fully on both sides of notebook paper with these, because you'll probably be able to see through to the other side.  This doesn't bother me, because of the ease in writing with Flairs.  They don't bleed through the paper that checks are made from, so they're fine to write checks with, they won't ruin the next check or anything.FYI, you can't press through to multiple carbon copies with Flairs (or any felt tip pens) -- you'd need a ball point pen for that.  You'd damage the felt tip if you tried, and even then it wouldn't be hard enough to provide the pressure needed.  I find that there are few instances nowadays when you are required to write on forms with carbon copies, so I don't think that's a big problem.  (I have also just written on each of the carbon copy pages individually to avoid shoulder pain from ball point pens.)These usually wash out easily of clothing (assuming the clothing is washable and you don't wait too long or accidentally dry it before noticing the ink...though even then I usually can get it out with an overnight soak in detergent water).  I wouldn't necessarily give them to little kids, though, unless they're wearing old clothes and stay away from upholstery!  :-)Overall, I prefer the Liquid Flairs (aka Liquid Expresso), because they're even easier to write with than these Flairs -- but those are significantly more expensive, and they also take longer to dry, so they can be impractical when you're in a hurry (like with check writing).  The Liquid Flairs can also be more prone to leaks, mostly caused by broken caps...these regular Flairs have caps that never break, in my experience.  I keep both kinds in my purse, on my desk, and pretty much everywhere else I write!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BQXXAQAWXGIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHJC480#wasThisHelpful","R3BQXXAQAWXGIJ","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd forgotten how Tammy Fay Baker's eyelashes looked...but I remember now!This is some seriously heavy-looking mascara.  I was hoping for more of a voluminous look, sort of like the gel lashes look...but this is more of a ""look how much mascara I have on"" look.  It's virtually impossible to put this stuff on even slightly normal looking, because of the weird applicator.  I may actually try to put a different applicator in if I find one that fits from another mascara that I use up all the way...I suspect that's the only difference between this and any other (cheap) mascara.It also flaked and smeared...really bad.  Like Wet-n-Wild bad.  I think this is marketed towards teens, because the regular price is slightly lower than other L'Oreal mascara...but I wouldn't recommend it even for club-hopping, because I don't care what your age is, girls want their mascara on their lashes, not smeared on their cheeks and undereye area.It's worth paying an extra 2 or 3 dollars and getting a better mascara:""L'Oreal Double Extend"" is great (provides great length, doesn't come off, yet weirdly comes right off all at once with only water!).  Two coats, but worth the extra time.Also nice for making very beautiful lashes is ""Cover Girl Clump Crusher"" -- not as long wearing as the Double Extend, but makes more of a statement, and is faster to apply.

"These pads do seem to have a lot of potential - they really seemed to minimize pores and generally smooth my skin.  (The effects kind of reminded me of when I used to use Retin-A gel.).  The pads felt exfoliating to me, kind of rough, at least with the product on them.Unfortunately, the pads quickly became too irritating to my (sensitive) skin, and I finally had to stop using them.  I could not find a schedule or application method that worked for me.  So, as long as you don't have sensitive skin, these will probably work well...but if your skin can't take products that sting a little, you probably won't be able to tolerate these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OBHIYUCJJQZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI6TSHI#wasThisHelpful","R2OBHIYUCJJQZA","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this serum on my face and neck -- for everywhere else, I use the Sublime Bronze spray.I find that the tan color matches between this serum and the spray (they're both L'Oreal, so not surprising).  The serum actually colors better and more efficiently than the spray -- there's little or no wasted product, versus the spray, which is easier to apply evenly to awkward areas, but ends up with a large amount of product on the floor.I have fair skin, and I don't need 3 consecutive days for this to look like a nice, light natural color -- I'd say two days is almost always just right.  I reapply (once) after about 3 days, or if I swim, exfoliate, sweat a lot, etc.  I like that it isn't too much, too soon -- easier to correct minor mistakes (uneven application or skipped spots).I would DEFINITELY get a pair of latex or vinyl gloved to apply this, however!  It will stain your hands (hard to wash it ALL off, it always ends up somewhere), and also, you'll waste a lot when it soaks into the skin on your hands.

"I'm overall not impressed with this bacon grilling rack.  The reasons why I WOULDN'T recommend it:- The rack itself is designed with two separate ""channels"" for grease to drain on either side -- this makes it difficult to drain the hot grease after cooking (since obviously you can't pour hot grease into a garbage bag or can).  You either need to pour it into a very large-mouthed contained (like a mixing bowl) first, and THEN pour it into a grease jar; or you need to pour it simultaneously into two separate jars spaced perfectly apart.  (And you can't just carefully fold the rack back up and THEN drain it all at once from the now-close-together channels, because they tilt at an angle when folded and would spill.)  Also, they could've at least put a small spout at the end(s) of the grease channels to aid in draining them...it is hard to predict which direction the hot bacon grease will pour out.- For a bacon cooker, it doesn't fit many pieces of bacon -- maybe 6?- It's not easy to clean, because the grease draining channels and every other corner of this metal rack is squared off -- so there are lots of deep, squared-off inside corners to try to reach and clean out.  Rounded or curved surfaces anywhere would have been a much better design.  You need a Q-Tip to clean this thing out thoroughly.- You can't flip the bacon halfway through cooking, because it is rigid and v-shaped.  You can flip the bacon much earlier in the cooking process--maybe 1/4 way through cooking--but even that is a little awkward.- The draining channels are not big enough to catch all the grease from any more than a few pieces of bacon (unless you have really lean bacon, like turkey bacon, maybe).  So you'll need to drain this thing halfway through if you want to cook 10-12 pieces.So overall, while it generally works, it is not designed well enough for me to recommend it.  It will cook about 5 or 6 pieces of bacon, but I'm afraid people will burn themselves trying to figure out how to drain this thing, or trying to turn it to get the bacon to cook evenly.  It is also annoying to clean, due to the squared box-shaped grease channels, and folds up a little awkwardly -- seemingly bulkier than it would need to be.I'd keep looking if I were you!","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FR693W4MBTJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0L5NGM#wasThisHelpful","R1FR693W4MBTJ8","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This BB Cream (""BB"" stands for ""Beauty Balm,"" in case you didn't know) is basically a tinted moisturizer with SPF 15 sunscreen.  I'm not certain what else a ""BB Cream"" is SUPPOSED to do, but I can tell you that to me, they perform just as a tinted moisturizer with SPF...so I think it is primarily a newer marketing term.Anyway, this Proactiv BB Cream is both non-comedogenic (won't clog pores) and fragrance-free.  (Note that it is not labeled as hypo-allergenic, however.)  I have very sensitive skin, and this product did irritate my skin a little on days when it was sensitive already (if I'd exfoliated recently, or if it was very hot or windy outside).Anyway, this isn't going to replace a sunscreen if you are OUT in the sun -- it's really better for everyday exposure to the sun, in small amounts, like walking to your car, etc.  Not for the beach (you have to keep from exposing the bottle to direct sun anyway).  Be sure to not get it too near your eyes...apply it AFTER any under-eye concealer.It works ok as a tinted product -- not much coverage, but it also has a nice, natural appearance, unlike a lot of BB Creams I've tried, which tend to make the face look dirty.  It works very well on me as a moisturizer, at least now in the warmer months.  It feels very smooth on the skin, and it felt moisturizing all day.  It doesn't feel greasy, and it feels especially nice and ""clean"" around the nose area, which can easily feel oily, and is a region where I often feel products don't ""sink in"" to my skin very well.Overall, I like this BB Cream -- I wouldn't use it if I were to be in the sun a lot on a given day (it warns you to reapply every 2 hours in the sun, and that would get expensive fast!).  I like it for everyday use -- for something like work or school.  I use it instead of a foundation, with some concealer, since it's a lighter product and is not intended to provide a lot of coverage.I have pretty fair skin, and the ""Light"" wasn't too dark, didn't make my skin look dirty or muddy, and blended well with my (pale, reddish toned, Scandinavian-type) coloring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DJO9M7U6RFGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTCUQ2Q#wasThisHelpful","R3DJO9M7U6RFGL","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have sensitive skin, and Cetaphil is one of the few face washes that won't break the bank.(During severe sensitive skin flare-ups -- typically during extreme cold/dry weather or when I've been swimming in chlorine -- I use CeraVe, but that doesn't clean quite as well if my skin is particularly sweaty or dirty.)This formula for ""men"" seems to me to be exactly the same as the regular formula, except for its scent.  It smells slightly like most men's toiletries, but nothing overpowering.  The scent is mild and refreshing.  It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.  I think it actually smells better than the regular, so I'd either buy whichever one is cheaper, or just get the men's if they're the same.  No reason a husband and wife couldn't both use this product.It rinses cleanly and really doesn't leave a lingering scent behind that will clash with aftershave or cologne.  My skin doesn't feel dry and tight after using it (unless it already felt that way before washing). Works well to prep the skin before shaving, since it removes dirt and oil but doesn't strip or irritate the skin (except in cases where my skin is extremely dry in the winter).The shape of the bottle is nice, because it doesn't tend to tip over or need to be held with the other hand when using the pump to dispense the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVNZDJ2VZ4SJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHNZZ4G#wasThisHelpful","RVNZDJ2VZ4SJI","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought from the picture that this nail clipper was a wider, unique design, which had a larger area to grip (better for men's hands).However, this is simply a standard, regular nail clipper, which is placed inside of a black sort of ""shell"" that supposedly catches the clippings.  You lift the clippers out of the black part completely to empty it (which is extremely difficult!)It does NOT catch clippings in the black part, however -- there is not a ""reservoir"" for clippings in that black area on the sides, it's just solid plastic!  Clippings just get crammed behind the blades, so it will fill up quickly.It takes a lot of force to pull the metal clippers out of that pointless black plastic shell to empty them, too...and then you have to smack the clippers to get the clippings to come out, because they're just packed in right behind the blade.  This takes approximately 100 times more effort than simply getting a garbage can and clipping over it to begin with.The clippers are nice and sharp, but are only on the nicer end of a normal drug store set of nail clippers...they do not work ANY better.  They are the exact same design as pretty much every nail clipper you have ever seen, nothing special.  The black plastic shell is so annoying that it's about the end up in the garbage along with any clippings that it didn't really catch.  Oh, and if you can see what appears to be a metal edge along the side of the black plastic shell...it's just a strip of thin metal trim that has been glued on!  I think it's placed there to make it seem like it's a pull-out file or something useful, or to make you think the black plastic part is integrated into the clippers...either way, just something to fool people into thinking these are nicer than they are.There is no swing-out file/nail cleaner, FYI...kind of surprised they'd charge this much for nail clippers and not even bother to throw in that feature.These are definitely NOT worth the price they're listed for.

"This review is for ""Unstopables Febreze Air Freshener - Fresh"" (the scent of the can with the blue top is called ""Fresh.""  It is a Febreze-containing air freshener, but at least at the time I am writing this review, its product name inadvertently leaves out the word Febreze, unlike the other two scents).This 9.7 ounce can is a slightly larger size than most air freshener cans (the Air Wick can I most recently bought is 8 ounces).It has a trigger-pull style top, however, I should point out that in fact this IS an aerosol can.  The trigger makes it look like a spray bottle (like what Windex comes in, for example), but in fact when you press the trigger, aerosol-propelled air freshener comes out.  It will keep spraying continuously if you hold the trigger, just like when you hold the button down on a regular can of air freshener, or a can of spray paint.  It is easier to spray than a regular air freshener can because of the comfortable trigger style, and it won't clog or need to be tipped in a certain direction when it's close to empty like a spray bottle does...but I wanted to be clear that if you wanted to purchase this product because the can style is better for the environment, the trigger is just for looks and ease of use; it's still aerosol.Anyway, the ""Fresh"" scent of this air conditoner is actually a pretty fantastic smell!  It smells to me like rain, combined with a sweet women's cologne.  It has a slight smell of Febreze as well, which I like.  It doesn't smell heavy to me, it smells very appealing, and indeed I think 'fresh' is a good word for it.  It does a very good job of covering up odors, in the bathroom or otherwise.  It lasts pretty long -- I'm not sure I can smell it 6 hours later as the can claims, but I definitely can still smell it at least a couple hours after spraying it.  I can use far less of this to cover an odor than most air fresheners...just a very short spray will eliminate an odor completely in most cases.A note on prices...at the time I wrote this review, this 9.7 ounce can was being listed for 3-4 times the cost of a regular 8 oz. can of air freshener -- I believe it was about twelve dollars!  I do not understand why, or if that was an error (maybe it was supposed to be a multi-pack?), but there is nothing that should make a single can of this product cost that much more than a regular air freshener; in stores it is only marginally more expensive, due to its larger size and the Febreze name.

"I actually think this ""Saggo Worry Eater"" is just ok...it's not quite as nice as I thought it would be.He is 14"" tall, from his foot to the top horn on his head, and 9"" wide from arm to arm.  His zippered mouth is 6 1/2"" wide.  He is 90% polyester, 10% cotton.  There are no clear washing instructions -- only on the sewn-in tag are there some of those extremely tiny ""cleaning hieroglyphics"" that nobody can translate (such as the triangle which has been crossed out...do not put this into a triangle or pyramid of any kind!)  It appears that the only symbol which has not been crossed out is possibly a hand reaching into a basin of water(?)  It's very small, but I think that's what the symbol shows...so I'm guessing it is saying to hand wash this only.  Or maybe to have it baptized.  Your call.  ;-)His tag says he is suitable for all ages, 0+ months.  You must remove the orange plastic loop sewn in at the top if a baby is to be around this.  I don't think I'd be comfortable giving a baby this toy, with a zipper.  I think this toy seems more suitable for a child who is at least 2 years old (but ideally one who can write at some level).It is very soft material, just slightly less plush or not quite as nice quality as I was expecting.  The orange stripes aren't as bright as they appear in the pictures.  On the one I received, the striped material is slightly duller in color than the solid orange material (but neither appear ""vivid"").  I hate to say it, but I'm sure I've seen a stuffed ""Worry Eater"" toy like this that used to actually be made in Germany, and was quite nicer...this is now made in China.  It seems mass-produced now...nice enough quality, but not made with the same level of care it once was.The zipper is excellent quality, and the way the mouth is red inside is very cute.  I wish the pocket inside ran the whole front length of the body -- the pocket only extends about halfway down the front of the striped body.  Still, it is big enough to fit a lot of paper -- you'd just need to use small pieces.  Would be cute if it came with a little pad of paper!There is an 2"" orange plastic hanging loop, with a break at one end for removal, which is sewn in with a small white loop of cord, at the top of the head, behind one of the ""horns.""  It is odd that this isn't sewn in behind at the top horn, though (it's behind horn #4, if you count from left to right).  The plastic loop is visible when not in use, and if used, won't hang the Saggo straight.  (Not a big deal, since you can take it off.)The thing that kind of bugs me is that for a ""Worry Eater,"" this particular character (Saggo) seems to exude anxiety, from his stripes to his psychotic eyes.  He looks kind of freaked out...  I feel like if I were a child with a lot of worries, I wouldn't find it soothing to have that strung-out, fearful expression in my bed!  I know, he's supposed to look worried, since he ""eats your worries""...it makes sense, and honestly, many kids will probably love him.  I just think many of the other ""Worry Eater"" characters actually have nicer looks -- they have the same nervous zippered mouth and a worried expression, but goofier, sillier faces (with less frantic eyes!)...I'd pick one of those instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1259AF0OA7QND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VZ36JLK#wasThisHelpful","R1259AF0OA7QND","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used many ""contractor"" bags since buying a fixer-upper of a house a few years ago.  Every brand of black contractor bags I've tried is strong enough to not rip under even pretty brutal conditions (such as broken asphalt tiles, splintered wood), within reason of course.  A nail sticking out of a piece of wood will poke through any bag, including these.However, the other non-flexing and non-drawstring contractor bags have a big problem: they are extremely difficult to move!  They can be filled, but then have to be tied off at the top with a cable tie or large twisty -- then picked up and brought to the curb (or thrown into a garbage can, which is even harder, since construction waste is usually quite heavy).  Unless non-drawstring bags are only half full, I can get a good enough grip on the bag to carry it very far -- so I end up using more of them, which wastes money.With these Ultra Flex drawstring bags, I find it much easier to carry them out of the house or out to the curb, since they have a handle.  I can also fill them up more, both because I don't have to allow room for a loose area of the bag to be tied off at the top with a twisty tie, and because these expand to allow more awkwardly-shaped items inside.So even if these are more expensive to begin with than plain contractor bags (and they're not that much more expensive), I use less of them...even half as many in some cases.  They are also far less frustrating to deal with, I spend less time trying to fit garbage inside them a specific way, because they will flex to accommodate items that are a little too large/long for regular contractor bags.  They are extremely difficult to rip -- even when they tear, it's not usually ""all over""...they seem to just tear in one place, but often can still be used.  These also don't open up after they're tied off, so when they're all piled at the curb on trash day, they don't come open if they fall over or another bag lands on top of them.  Saves a lot of headaches.  Highly recommend having a bag of these on hand for any household renovations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZKRQC06N6JIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028LQ4U4#wasThisHelpful","RZKRQC06N6JIJ","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not like this set of hooks as much as I'd expected to.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.PROBLEM #1: STRIPS SHOW THROUGH!My biggest gripe is that you can see right THROUGH the hooks...you can even tell which way the strips are facing!  These are special strips, made exclusively for these ""clear"" bath items -- but they made the plastic hooks TOO clear, so you can see right though it to the Command strips behind it.  (Naturally, this has been photoshopped out of the product photos.)  Ugly and tacky!PROBLEM #2: HOOKS TOO WIDE TO HANG MOST THINGS ON!The hooks themselves are too thick/wide to hang many bath items on.  No items I have for the bath that have holes on their handles for hanging will fit on this hook, because the hooks are wide at their tips to begin with, and get even wider towards the bottom.  Items with loops or strings (such as bath puffs or soap-on-a-rope) will fit, but many things like foot files, a back brush, a loofah on a stick, any bottles with hanging holes for the shower -- won't fit onto these hooks at all.  BOO, 3M!  I don't understand that product design decision at ALL, it makes the hooks far less useful.  Loops of string will hang off just about anything, including a shower head, I hardly need a fancy hook set for that...I assumed a specially designed set of bath hooks would also accommodate other hanging bath items.  (You'll notice in their product photo, only items with strings are shown hanging, because that's probably all they could find to fit on these hooks too!)PROBLEM #3: ONLY 1 SET OF STRIPS COME WITH IT!Have you ever bought a Command hook that DIDN'T come with 2 sets of strips (so you could install the hook somewhere twice?)  Me neither.  Well, on the package, this one says ""2 Large Strips"" -- but guess what?  You need BOTH strips to put the hook up ONE TIME.  So you'd better get it in the right place the first time...no second chances here!  It should have said ""One set of strips included"" or something clearer.  Especially annoying, because these types of strips are more expensive, and much harder to find replacements for.  Also, the adhesive strips that came with mine had far less aggressive adhesive than comes with every other Command hook I've ever used.  I pressed it on like crazy, but I fully expect it to fall off...FYI, I think these hooks are VERY old (I bought this in May 2015)...the adhesive seems dried up already.  The date on the packaging says 2013.I wouldn't buy this product again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23174KH5ZVEOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCP7MNE#wasThisHelpful","R23174KH5ZVEOC","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very sweet, soft all over doll, with a lovely lavender scent.  The doll itself is perfect for sending the little one (must be at least 12 months old) off to sleep...although I don't think the accessories, which include a pacifier, bottle, and lamb, as well as her clothes and the hat (which comes off to reveal a tuft of blonde hair), are a great idea to send to bed, because they just end up getting lost inside blankets, behind the headboard, etc.The pacifier is magnetic and sticks to the baby's mouth, and the BOTTLE is magnetic too!  They don't mention that the bottle is also magnetic in the description.  Very cute...the baby has an adorable smile without the pacifier blocking it.  Wish the pacifier had a clip to attach it to its outfit or something, it's very easy to lose.  Also wish the bottle wasn't white, because you just know that thing is going to end up in an actual child's mount at some point, and it gets a little gross...  But it's nice that even a young child can put the pacifier and bottle in, because you don't have to do anything more than just get them near the mouth, and the magnet pulls it into place!The doll itself is quite well made -- not just a flat, poorly constructed doll like many that are dressed.  It has a round belly, curved legs, a little bum...very cute!The clothes can be taken off -- they have Velcro closures.  They're pretty good quality compared to other doll clothing I've seen recently.  The sleeper is one piece (in the picture, it appears that she is wearing pink booties, but in reality just the bottom soles of the feet of the sleeper are pink).  The diaper isn't as nice, it's kind of cheaply made...real preemie diapers will fit, but they'll be a bit large.  (Stella is potty trained, so she won't make a mess if she loses her diaper.)  ;-)The lamb is cute -- it has an elastic loop sewn onto it, so I'm the package it looks like Stella is holding it in her hand.  The loop is permanently sewn on (it can be cut off if you're concerned your child may put it on their wrist too tight, or on the dog's mouth or something!)The lavender scent is heavenly...they need to make an adult version of this!  I'm not sure yet how long the scent will last.  It isn't overpowering, and I really do think lavender has natural relaxing effects that promote sleep (it does for me!).  I washed it once, and it still has a little scent.  I keep a bottle of lavender oil on hand anyway (only a few dollars on Amazon), so when the scent begins to fade, I will just put a drop on the doll somewhere in a hidden area to ""revive"" the scent.I should mention, the face is embroidered on, so there are no eyes or other small parts that can come off.  The doll itself is nicely made.  (But again, 12 months and up.)I have washed it in the washing machine on a delicate (""hand wash"") cycle, then tumble dried it on a very low setting for a bit, let it dry in a sunny window (just to make sure it didn't develop mildew) -- it did great!  I don't know if you're technically supposed to machine wash it, but I didn't have any problems.FYI, this is made in China.

"This cordless vacuum is a great solution for a large finished basement with multiple rooms, crevices, and hard-to-reach areas, like under/behind a staircase.  No cord to get caught on furniture and fixtures, or knock over lamps!  Also no constant looking for the next outlet that will allow me to reach everywhere I need to vacuum in the next room.  (This is a huge help, since bending over a lot to reach outlets near the floor hurts my back after a while.)It is flexible and small enough on the roller part that it fits nicely into smaller or wedge-shaped areas.  I am not very strong, and this vacuum is easy to pick up and move where I want it.I use it only to vacuum hardwood floor and tile floors (there's no carpet where I use it, except an extremely low-pile little rubber-backed door mat, which is does fine on, although it tends to pick it up off the floor with its powerful suction, like every other vacuum I've used on a door mat).I think this is specifically designed for hard floors, not carpeting.  This is perfect for my needs, and it means the vacuum doesn't have to be as large and heavy as one powerful enough to suck dirt out of thick carpets...so it is light enough to carry up and down a flight of stairs easily.One charge lasts me for at least 30 minutes, no problem, which is as long as I need to use it at one time -- it isn't showing any signs of dying at 30 minutes, so I'm confident it would work for 45 minutes or longer...maybe even an hour.  It does not take long to charge.The detachable DustBuster-like device isn't my favorite thing...I find it helpful in some situations, like getting some dust out from extremely small areas, such as behind the water heater, or vacuuming in a corner that has too many cords criss-crossing on the floor to be able to push the whole vacuum cleaner.I've never tried an Electrolux brand before, but I am impressed with the ability of this cordless vac!  I absolutely LOVE not having to navigate around with a cord.  It's great to use in a situation where there's a room without available or easily accessible outlets.  Also great if there are kids running around (or a spouse texting and not paying attention!) who will trip over unplug the cord by accident (or worse yet, fall and hurt themselves).I also like the freedom the cordless design gives you to vacuum from any direction -- with a cord, you tend to have to approach many areas with the outlet behind you, since if you turn around, the cord is in front and in the way...it's SO nice not to have to keep picking up and throwing the cord over coffee tables and things, or use your other arm as a ""cord wrangler""...now you can just hold the vacuum in one hand, and a martini in the other.  ;-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAW3DKBIO1YQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQHJV8C#wasThisHelpful","RAW3DKBIO1YQ8","A141W8WHW9AC3H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A141W8WHW9AC3H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dog is 8 years old -- he loves this food, eats it voraciously.It doesn't make him sick (with lower quality food, I've noticed that he will get sick a couple of times a month, on average...I have no idea what causes it, but I believe there is some ingredient missing that he requires to maintain a healthy digestive tract or something).  He never gets sick on this (Purina Pro Plan ""Bright Mind"") food.I deducted one star primarily because it contains meat by-product, and within the first 10 ingredients.  I would greatly prefer that by-product not be included in dog food -- I was a little surprised to see it in this food, because it is a premium line.  It's a very low-quality ingredient, and I hope Purina considers taking it out.Other than that, I'm generally satisfied with this food...my dog seems happy and healthy.  He does not, however, now have a ""bright mind""...but he was born a knucklehead, and he will stay a knucklehead!  He thinks the world is a great place to be, and acts accordingly.

"These arrived just thrown into a box, no directions.  There aren't directions printed onto the pod covers themselves, either.  However, maybe that's not supposed to be the norm...so I can overlook that and find the information I seek online.The biggest problem is that half of these were spilling open...seed and fertilizer all over the box, things inside the pods now mixed up or no longer at the depth they were supposed to be.I also am not sure these have been stored correctly, which is why I suspect the tops have come off some of them.  There was no protection from water, as they were just sitting in a cardboard box, so if the package got rained on...there's the end of your seeds and peat!At the end of the day, this is just not a good value, even if it does survive the journey intact...for example, zucchini doesn't even need to be started indoors or in a pot, the way tomatoes do.  Zucchini seeds can be sowed directly in the ground...and you can buy a whole package of seeds for each vegetable for the same price as just getting 4 seeds of each here.  Ideally you want to start many more plants such as tomato, because it is a ""tender"" plant, and you want to choose only the healthiest baby plants to try to get a harvest from...you want lots of choices when you thin them down to the final plants to grow, not one (or four from one pot!)I think this is a gimmick, and not a good value at all.  They give you far too little info as to how to grow these successfully (these included vegetable plants all can't start the same week, for example...tomatoes may need to have been started as early as March if you live in northern areas such as Chicago, for example).  So, if you buy these in May, it's already too late for the tomatoes, but too early for the cucumbers (again, this is an example...if you live in a warmer climate, the rules are different!)Overall, I wouldn't recommend this.  A better gift would be a lovely assortment of seed packets, with all their plentiful information and climate maps.

"I just got this, unboxed, and already realize I don't like it. I should have paid more attention to the ports and connectors.This battery may be great for power. I don't know and no longer care.The only port on the battery is a female micro USB, which sounds good and standards-based. But the battery uses this port for self-charging (a standard use, much like a phone) but then also uses the same port backwards for powering your dead mobile device (non-standard). You will need a male to male micro USB wire. Ask yourself, how many micro USB to micro USB wires have you ever seen?To make it work with just the one port, they include their own custom wire kit of 2 short adapter wires. One is the fairly standard male USB to male micro USB cable you can use to charge your phone or this battery. The other is a male micro USB to female USB. To charge this device is thus completely standard, and you could use your phone's charger and wire if you wanted. But to USE this battery on the go would require you to carry both the short wires they provide.

"Stop thinking about it. If you have a indoor Foscam, and you are spending the time worrying about signal strength, and you have invested your time, money, and wishes on the cameras, just get these antennae for EVERY one of your cams. Here's why:Unless the Foscam is in the same room as the router, an IP cam puts a lot of strain on your WiFi. Unlike web pages or email, a cam streams video, video is high bandwidth, and if you're storing your video on a PC (usin Blue Iris software, for example) the cam is streaming 24x7. Add a few more cams, and that's a lot of bandwidth.As your wifi channel becomes slightly congested, and your signal strength is not ideal, the cameras start dropping data packets, and trying to re-send, and then conflicting with the other cameras which all want to send their video NOW! Stronger signal avoids the lost packets and the resends. Use these, or even better, run Ethernet cable. You won't believe how much better the cameras work on Ethernet.By running all upgraded antennae, you will get better framerates from all cams, more reliable connections, the ability to have more cams on the same wifi network, fewer crashes, fewer bugs, faster PTZ response, etc. That's true even if your system works just fine with the shorties.Here's the downside, which is manageable: these antennas aren't magic. They don't make your signal stronger, they just change the aim of the signal. With the shorter stock 3dbi pole antenna, picture a big donut around the tip of the antenna. That is where your signal goes. Now, with this longer 9dbi pole antenna, picture a flat pancake around the tip of the antenna. That is where your signal goes with this unit. That means you have to aim the antenna in such a way that the wifi AP is on a plane perpendicular to the antenna. If your Foscam is one floor above your WiFi, this antenna will make your signal WORSE if you keep the antenna straight up, and don't ""aim the pancake"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DFI7JYBODRNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TPS9PC#wasThisHelpful","R2DFI7JYBODRNR","A1DDZTDK7NKWQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZTDK7NKWQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a couple of important scientific principles at work with this spa cover, but most people assume the second-most important one is the most important, and that causes misunderstandings.1) Evaporation barrier. Note, this is not the same as a vapor barrier, which blocks water that has ALREADY evaporated into vapor. An Evaporation barrier can be a smooth impermeable blanket that sits over water, preventing the water from contacting the air above. Such a barrier prevents passive evaporation (not boiling) of your spa water. If you remember your science, evaporation requires heat energy to occur (it's endothermic), so when some of your spa water does vaporize, it sucks heat out of your spa. If your top cover isn't perfectly airtight, that water vapor will leak to the atmosphere, fresh air will enter, and then you'll vaporize some more spa water. This type of blanket almost stops evaporation. And believe me, your spa water DOES want to vaporize -- if you've ever seen steam off your spa, then you can believe me. Every bit of that steam sucked heat energy from your spa as it left. Not just the heat it took with it as warm steam, but additional energy it already stole when it converted phase from water to vapor.2) Insulation barrier. By separating your hot spa water from cooler air above, there is less transfer of heat. This is one thing the bubbles in the blanket help with (floating is the other thing). The insulation component of this blanket is most useful if you don't have another spa cover, and the outside air is significantly colder than the spa water. But if you already have an insulated cover, the role of the bubble blanket is trivial. Think about it: 4"" of closed cell foam versus thin plastic with a single bubble: which one is giving you more insulation?For a blanket like this, evaporation blocking is FAR more important than insulation. For that reason, BUBBLES UP IS THE BETTER WAY to install it. The smooth bottom will separate water from air more, and prevent more evaporation. Bubbles down will allow some evaporation, and allow the vapor to escape through air pockets out to the edges, and into the air cavity. Bubbles down does offer more insulation, because the air pockets between the bubbles offer some additional insulation, along with the air trapped in the bubbles. But, as stated, stopping evaporation is what is most important.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGIG79PLBLGHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O640HO#wasThisHelpful","RGIG79PLBLGHJ","A1DDZTDK7NKWQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZTDK7NKWQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Time for an angry review, since I just wasted the last 4 hours of my weekend on this.I was hoping for a sprayer to aim directly on poop in my RV toilet. Once, installed, this thing does NOT produce a jet, as one would desire for such a product, but rather a ""gentle spray"". This means it will be rather ineffective at its main task. This, by itself, is enough to rate this produce a one star.It gets worse. On my Thetford Aqua Magic V, which is designed for such a hand sprayer, I cut off the appropriate nozzle, and connected it. This was relatively easy. But it turns out that the way the toilet is plumbed, the hand sprayer will only operate when the flush nozzle is ALSO held open. This means it has to share pressure with the bowl filler, AND that the bowl will fill as you spray. How exactly does this save me water? Remember, this isn't my fault for bad plumbing - I connected the hand sprayer to the correct optional nipple. In retrospect, I WISH I had plumbed a T into the supply line, and connected a cheap unit like this one:Plumb Craft 7635700 Sink SprayerThe product listed here is basically the same, except that it comes with a toilet bottom gasket for re-sealing the toilet in case you need to remove the toilet to get enough space to access the connection point. As fate would have it, that applied to me. So, I spent a fair bit of time removing my toilet, peeling, then scraping off the old (gross) gasket. Then attaching the sprayer, then replacing the toilet, then trying to solve the leaks that came where the water supply connects to the toilet. Because while they gave the big gasket for the toilet outlet, they did not supply a replacement washer for the water supply connection.Now, I have a variety of drips going on back there. One slow one from the bad washer, but one that seems to be caused by thehand sprayer itself. I think the hand sprayer and its hose drain back and out of the toilet valves when the water pump is turned off and pressure drops. Either way, I'm glad I have  my toilet mounted in a ""wet"" shower in the RV. Cuz it's wet.So, doesn't work for intended purpose, was a pain to put in, seems to cause backwash leak, wastes water, is far more expensive than the same product for your kitchen sink.

"This camera works great for me. I installed it in my Dodge RAM because the truck is huge, and it's very hard to see what's behind, and also to hitch up my trailers. This cameras is mirrored, and has the guidelines on them that can't be turned off.I plugged this rear cam into a LockPick, a device that allows owners of various vehicle brands to use their factory radio screen to display other video sources. So my cam is fully integrated into the OEM car display. Awesome. I put it in reverse, the rear view image comes up on my screen in 1 second. I bought the Lockpick at Amazon, and recommend it: B008MTYEZS  Be sure to find the Lockpick model for your carmaker, this one is for Chrysler.The camera's 170 degrees is a pretty wide angle, which allows me to see the ground directly behind the truck, and captures the ground below both corners of my rear bumper. A narrower view would be OK, but less useful for avoiding close objects near the corner of the bumpers. I bought and tested a 120 degree camera, but didn't like the width of view, so *before* I installed it, I just bought this one instead.Install is pretty straightforward. I needed some RCA extension wires to reach all the way to the back of my full size crew cab.The image is very good for the price. I don't think it's worth the $300 the OEM camera cost for a slightly better camera. I'm really just trying to avoid hitting obstacles, not watching Avatar in 3D. It is color, it works. At night, the camera works OK just using the lights from the truck. It is notably dim when I look at it while moving forward (a Lockpick option), but putting the truck in reverse turns on even more light. When an obstacle gets close, it gets bright because of proximity to the truck lights, and that makes obstacles easily noticed. At night, you won't see a tree 15 ft away, but you absolutely will see one 5 feet away. Perfect.Here are the cons:Packaging is random. It may come in a box, or in a bag.

"I use two 28"" screens with my desktop computer, so it's always been a big hit when I go remote and need to work on my awesome laptop. No matter how good this laptop is, it still only has a 14"" screen. With the smaller single screen, I estimate I can be about 70% as effective as I can while working at home. This AOC screen allows me to take *some* of the benefits of a big desk setup with me on the road. I don't carry this for meetings, conferences, or for using at the coffee shop or on the train! But I DO take it when I'm likely to be in the same hotel for a few days, or abroad for a few weeks. It helps me set up a remote office without a big productivity hit.Pros:Simple USB-only hookupcan work off laptop batteries, which drain faster, but still no plug is requiredI plugged it into Windows 7...it found its own drivers, then just workedLightnice built-in standeasy for portrait or landscapesame resolution as my laptopFor sales guys, or people making presentations, it's easy to point one screen at the customer, and the laptop at you.I plugged a single plug into a single USB 2.0 port, and that worked (no second USB plug needed for power.)Easy to shareCons:thicknot protected for travel, you'll need to get a bag or some container, or fit it into your existing briefcaseI don't like the location of the USB port, which is hiding in the slot where the stand retracts. You need to remove the wire to fold in the stand.Some of the ways I use two screens to be more productive:1) I can have email on one window, and a browser on the other, when I click news links in newsletters, it opens a browser and loads the page while I can still continue reading the newsletter. This way, I'm not waiting for web pages to load, I only look at them after they are ready.2) I can be writing one document while viewing source information on the other screen instead of needing to flip back and forth.3) Multitasking, such as viewing a video while managing files or cleaning up an inbox.4) I put one in portrait to view a full paper page of a document, instead of a partial page.5) There are many more little ways two screens helps. It ends up saving a few seconds at a time...but it does it over and over, ALL DAY. It adds up. I put two screens on the desks of all my staff, so they can work better and the response is universal: Day 1: ""I don't really need 2 screens, I work fine with one."" Day 3: ""I see what you mean, there are a few things I can do faster.""

"Summary: This is a great shield for the price. It is a wet install, so takes a few days to look its best. But wet installs adhere better, and are easier to rid of air bubbles during installation.As an industry analyst, I go through a lot of phones and tablets. I usually put on a screen protector, so that I can get top dollar when I sell my old stuff (I keep all the boxes and materials, too.) So I've put on a bunch of screen protectors, and can confidently say: it is always a pain. Dust is very easily trapped, and alignment is always a challenge. Any efforts to clean out dust, or re-position the shield will almost always result in MORE dust.That said, this screen shield comes in a complete kit, with good instructions, good installation materials, and results in a good tight attachment. Unlike dry install shields, wet install shields require time to cure. They look much better after a day, and better still after a week.My advice, follow the instructions, but also do these important steps for ANY shield installation:- close windows, turn fans off, reduce opportunity for dust- do it in a bathroom after a shower (moisture drops dust out of air)- wash your hands first with soap to remove oils- keep fingers wet with application fluid (if available - this kit has it)- Worry about getting alignment right first, worry about bubbles AFTER- work the bubbles out to the sides patiently and diligently. Do it right away, tomorrow is too late.- I like to apply a little fluid on top of the screen guard as I work out the bubbles, so the tool slides better","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X9MXJINW7DR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057RMQA8#wasThisHelpful","R2X9MXJINW7DR9","A1DDZTDK7NKWQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZTDK7NKWQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No reviews here yet, so I thought I'd be helpful and do a quick one.Most RC cars and trucks require an expensive handheld remote to be packaged along with the toy, but a new kind of toy relies on something you might already have, a smartphone, then saves the cost of producing the remote.But smartphones can do more than basic remotes. Because they are expensive computers with accelerometers and touchscreens, the controller can provide battery information, tilt control, touch control and more. This RC truck does all that.I do not yet own one of these, but I tried it at a trade show, and found it lots of fun. There is a similar car product that doesn't handle carpet very well, but this truck model is fairly versatile.The toy does not use the phone's wifi or bluetooth, but instead needs you to plug in a RF transmitter to the phone's port. I'm sorry, but I don't know the range of the controller since I only used it up to 8 feet away.You should probably know that the toy is small.

"I've had and installed a few different front baskets lately, and this one is head and shoulders above the rest.PRO:- Not made of plastic. Most others have plastic mounting hardware.- Has a solid hold-off lever made of metal. Most baskets clamp on the handlebar with plastic, and have some mechanism on the clamp that prevents the basket from ""rolling down"", that is lowering when loaded, and rotating the mount that is on the handle. Most baskets, therefore, have very little leverage holding the basket up, and so it just pivots down around the handle. This basket uses a separate hold-off, which supports the basket lower down and pushed on the handlebar stock, and is adjustable to suit your bike.- Strong, can carry serious weight.- Easily removal that smartly uses the carry handle to unlock, good carry handle for the store.- Sits lower than the handlebar, so any lights mounted over the handlebar still can project forward.CON:- Somewhat inflexible in the width of the mount on the handlebar. I had an existing light that took up 3"" of space at the center of my handlebar. I had to bend the basket mount slightly outward so that it would fit around my light. But it did bend without any breakage.- Like any basket, it will interfere with your brake/gear cables that stick out in front of your handles. Not a big deal, and I tucked the cables in behind the mount so they never get in the way of the basket.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R341E0X4M4241G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001947Q44#wasThisHelpful","R341E0X4M4241G","A1DDZTDK7NKWQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZTDK7NKWQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good:- This unit is bigger than the others. It is 24"" wide, when most are 20"". I like the extra space for holding those plastic boxes.- Arrived fast- Seems strong enough, looks good enough- Weighs 60lb. Easy to carry by rails with one person and lots of space. For tight areas, may be better with two people.Not so good:- Shipping box, as others have said, seems inadequate. My UPS guy apologized and said I might want to inspect the package. I told him it's OK, the thing is strong metal, won't be broken but will be scratched. No big deal, since it's not fragile, but it should be better.Assembly:- Very easy, I thought. BUT, you are asked to provide a torque wrench - and not just any torque wrench. I have two, and one only goes up to 45 ft-lbs. Only my heavy-duty torque wrench can handle the 75 ft-lbs required by the 3 big bolts of this carrier. However, my thinking is that you could use a regular ratchet/wrench if you are a strong 175lb+ man and just tighten it as hard as you can. (You assume the risk if your bolts don't hold, of course.) Better to do it right at some point, or swing by any mechanic once you have it basically built - but you could use it right away, and fix the torque later.- 13mm and 19mm wrenches/sockets needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ATLMRM8GKN0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G4Z5J0#wasThisHelpful","R2ATLMRM8GKN0G","A1DDZTDK7NKWQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZTDK7NKWQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This single brake is a solid deal at around $10, and was easy to install and use. I use mine on an Adams Trail a Bike, where my bicycle pulls my kid on a bicycle trailer. With my weight, my bike, and her weight and her bike, I needed more braking power down hills into stop signs. By putting a brake on her trailer, she now can both pedal her own weight, and brake it.There are not 3, as in the picture, but one.The sizes, which the description fails to mention, are as follows:-  I put mine on a kid's 20 x 2.0 back tire. Fits easy.-  I measured the distance from the center mounting pin to the long sliding hole mount for the brake pad, it ranges from 3"" - 3 3/4.-  The shielded cable run jacket is 43"" and the brake cable extends about another 4"" beyond.-  The handle lever portion is smallish, a three finger brake for an adult, or normal for a child.People have noted that the instructions are poor. I agree. But not much instruction is needed for this item. Really, if you have an example brake anywhere in sight, you can just look and copy. But here are some instructions, follow them in order:- note that there are extra/optional parts. You don't need to use every part-  - use the shaped washers only if you are mounting to a circular tube.-  - use just one of the bolts, short or long, to suit the size of the bike's post to which you are mounting the brake-  - the s clip is for clipping the cable shield to another existing cable shield if you wish-  - there is one tie-down for holding the cable shield to the bike crossbar. Didn't fit for me. Used a zip tie instead.- mount the handle lever firmly, then the brake caliper firmly, then adjust the pads to the wheel rim, then tighten pads- route the cable intelligently to the caliper-  - put enough slack in the cabling to allow the steering wheel to move freely.-  - cut the cable jacket to size...but make sure you have slid the cable out first-don't cut the cable.- then thread the cable into the caliper, squeeze the caliper closed (use a friend or a clamp), then tighten the lock nut on the brake cable at the caliper arm- test, then adjust last step as needed for preferred operation- cut the brake cable as the very last step, after you have fully mounted, adjusted, and tested the brake. Leave 2 inches and cut the excess beyond that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ON5B9Q66QH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FJR0MM#wasThisHelpful","R20ON5B9Q66QH2","A1DDZTDK7NKWQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZTDK7NKWQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Read my updates at the end...the product has had its ups and downs.I've had my LX1 for about 6 months now (Oct 2010 - April 2011 through the winter in CA) and I absolutely love it. I used to ride my bike everywhere as a teen, until I got my first car. Since then, biking has been relegated to ""sport"" meaning that I mountain bike with friends for a high-octane workout, but I stopped doing it for transportation.Well, 30 years later, I'm biking for transportation again. And, believe me, it's not because I have more spare time. I always loved biking, but the trade-off versus a car just made the decision simple:- arrive sweaty?- short practical range?- arrive tired?- spend more time in travel?- carry almost nothing?Just about every time, the choice was the gas-burner. But with the LX1, many of those downsides of cycling have gone away. The hills between me and downtown are irrelevant, the time is about equal to a car, and I put on panniers to carry some things if I need.I sweat sometimes when I ride it, but that's by choice. I can pedal as hard or as lightly as I choose. Usually, I decide how hard I want to push the pedals, and just keep that pressure the whole ride. Now, when you're on a regular bike, you simply don't have that luxury. When faced with a hill, you HAVE to push harder. To start, you have to push harder. Not me. I just push steady and let the motor make up the difference.I have pushed this bike's limits, too. I decided that I wanted to bike my daughter to school instead of drive (just twice a week). I bought a bike trailer (trail-a-bike) and attached it. This adds substantial weight when my daughter is included. Anyway, it's great. On my regular bike with the trailer, we took 16 minutes to get her to school, and I took 17 back. 33 minutes, and I was a sweaty mess. With the LX1, it takes 10 minutes each way, I'm back in 20 and am not worn out. That's about 3 minutes faster than a car (because of shortcuts). This is good exercise, but not a ""workout"".Friends have made fun of me saying that an electric bike is ""lazy"", but they are missing the point. They are comparing it to a bicycle instead of comparing it to a car. I am out in the fresh air, getting some exercise, not burning gas INSTEAD of sitting my tush in a car. That's fantastic. I now make runs to the store on my bike, trips downtown on the weekend, post office runs, etc. All things that I used to do in my car...and I enjoy it.BTW, it's probably fair to note that I also have an awesome 1000cc motorcycle, which I ride less since I have my LX1. They're both fun in different ways. That's probably why I never ride the LX1 in ""throttle mode"". If I wanted to just sit and twist a throttle, I'd ride my motorcycle. But my advice to everyone is: pedal if you are physically able to do so. Electric bikes make it easy to ""get a little exercise"" while you go about your regular errands. Throttle riding is wasting a free opportunity to be healthier.I imagine it would be fun to travel with an LX1, and tour new towns, but with a family of four, it's too hard to carry all the bikes. However, for the motorhome crowd it could be great. Instead of towing a jeep around, just carry a couple of electric bikes. I have also added some really fat seats to my bikes, and baskets on the handlebars. I highly recommend the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001947Q44/ref=wms_ohs_product Lund from Amazon - it can handle much more weight than other designs.As for my review of the LX1 itself: It arrived as promised, was easy to get started. After six months of use - no problems. Instructions for the electronics are a little chinglish and unclear, but good enough. The bike is very solid, and appears well made and assembled. The motor is reliable, fairly quiet, and powerful. The controls are simple and clear, and the gears are smooth. The tires seem tough and heavy duty - good thing, because the rear end carries lots of weight. It's a good bike. But it's heavy! Which brings me to my only gripe: I feel like the brakes are underpowered given the heavy bike and rider. That's true with just the bike and my 215 lb. But I really push the brakes when I'm riding with a bike trailer and a daughter, and I live among hills. Going down a hill I always wish I had more braking power. Disc brakes on this bike would have made it a perfect machine.I have never managed to kill the battery. The claimed range is 30 miles, and I tend to ride < 9.Riding as a family was always tedious for me, because I was always waiting for my wife. Now when we go riding as a family, I put my wife on the LX1, and struggle to keep up with her on my regular bike. It actually is a real problem, because even on low power she cannot pedal and go slowly enough for me. With the throttle, she could go slowly, but with the pedal-assist, even if she just pushes feather-weight on the pedals, the motor kicks in (at I guess 60% power)and she will outpace me on a hill. I wish there were a lower setting. Naturally a second electric bike is in my future.============================Update: 6 months later (Aug 2011)I liked it so much I bought a second LX1 and have now had two for 4 months. I actually shopped all brands and models of ebikes again, but still ended up back on the LX1. It just suits me right. I also liked the e-moto brand. On the second LX1, I upgraded the brakes by calling and customizing the order. Now I feel better on big donwgrades. I also added a cheap brake to my kids bike-trailer for just $10, so they can do their own braking, too.For the problem in my last paragraph or the original review, where my wife could not ride slowly enough for me, we figured it out. If you use the pedal assist, you can choose 3 levels of assist. I would guess they are about 60% power, 80% power, and 100% power. None was low enough for me to keep up on a regular bike. But if you use the throttle, the twist throttle over-rides the pedal-assist. So by twisting the throttle just a little, she can add as little as 10% motor power to her pedaling, and then I could keep up. Of course, I solved that problem with a second LX1, and now we bike-trailer our two kids all over. The issue of one spouse being faster than the other on a bike is non-existent with 2 ebikes.The first LX1 continues to hold out with no problems.The second  LX1 had a problem after I assembled it. The motor inside the rear hub made a terrible noise, like skipping gears (which is probably what it was). I called R. Martin, and without much of a discussion at all, ""Randy"" agreed to ship me out a replacement. It arrived four days later, rear tire, wheel, hub and motor. I just swapped it with the broken one. I called Randy to ask how to ship the broken tire back, and he said ""Keep it. Sorry for the trouble."" So now I have extra tire, tube, wheel just in case of future problems.============================Update: 18 months of ownership (April 2012)Well, I had to deduct two stars - and I'm very sad about it. Around the time my first bike was almost a year old, and my second was about a half a year (sept 2011), both bikes started to show problems. What happens is that the entire electronic system shuts down when I am climbing a hill. That means you are left pedaling a heavy bike up a hill, which is way harder than a regular bike, which is exactly the opposite of the reason I bought these bikes.When you climb a hill on a fully recharged battery, the battery needs to deliver extra power to the motor. The motor on my LX1 is a powerful 350 Watt motor, not the more common 250 Watt. That wattage puts a high current demand on the battery. During this spurt, the apparent voltage of the battery drops from the full 40 volts down to low 30s. Although this is just a temporary drop, and the battery is still fully charged, the control circuitry interprets the low voltage as a near-dead battery that has traveled 30 miles. The control circuitry is designed to protect your battery from draining (because once fully drained, it cannot be recharged) so it shuts off the whole bike. The only way to turn it back on is to turn off the battery switch (inconvenient when you are mounted), turn it back on, and press the on/off switch again.The battery is clearly not dead, because it will happily run me for another 15 miles on flatter ground, even after cutting out on every hill.So, now I have one battery under warranty sent back to the seller, and they have had it for 6 weeks. I'm not sure what's taking them so long. But my concern is that even if I get a new battery back, the problem is in the control circuit's incorrect evaluation of a near-dead battery condition. If a battery is designed to last through 500 charge cycles, but can only climb hills in the first 6 months of its life, then the bike becomes a big paperweight. I don't need an e-bike to ride on flat terrain, so if it can't do hills, it has lost its main purpose.============================Update: 24 months of ownership (Oct 2012)Good news. I got both my bikes working fully - no thanks to the manufacturer, though. I sent them the battery that was worst, and they evaluated it to be A-OK, and sent it back. But the problem of the bike shutting itself off on any hill got worse. As I said, I tow a bike trailer often, but the battery would shut off with or without the extra weight. Well, with the fall coming, I wanted to ride my kids to school again, and just decided to fix it myself. I did a lot of research on electric bikes, control circuits, batteries, and Battery Management Systems. I was correct in my guess at the problem on the last update. The battery, if not brand new and in perfect condition, is just not adequate to drive the bike up hills so the system shuts down to ""protect a dead battery"" that isn't dead. That's why I got no help or useful advice from the bike maker: I doubt they would choose to admit the bike was under-powered by design.BTW, I added to the stress the bike needs to handle, too. Now I have two kids going to the same school, so I have a DOUBLE bike trailer that I pull with this LX1 ebike. And it still works!So, here's how I solved my problem, and am now as happy as Lindsay Lohan at a Jack Daniels factory. I went on the big online auction site and bought a second 36 volt lithium battery for each of my bikes. I bought one called ""kettle bottle"" which is smaller and basically fits on the bike like a water bottle often does. Understand that I did not buy this battery for increased range, but for extra current when climbing hills. Now, instead of one battery unable to provide current and voltage on an uphill, I have two that can share the load. And it works like a charm. Now, the batteries have more than enough power, and will last for years until they only put out 50% of their original peak current.Sure, this represents extra weight (3.1Kg), extra cost ($280 shipped from China), and extra work...but it returns me to my original happy review, above.How does one do this hack? You have to be capable with wiring, but don't need to be a pro. Take the new battery, and it's wiring output, and mount the battery to the bike. Use existing water bottle holes, or drill new ones, or use self-tapping metal screws. Open the control box and find the wires that come in from the existing battery. Add the new battery's wires old by stripping, wrapping, soldering (optional), and then tape thoroughly to protect. Positive wire to positive and negative to negative, use a voltmeter. Don't get positive and negative wires mixed up -- these batteries are powerful. Turn both batteries on and you're ready to tackle any hill.I'm back to riding over hill and dale, alone, or with my two kids on a double Adams Trail-a-bike. It's reliable, fun, and fit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FKSR3Y4IRKD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002X38JUA#wasThisHelpful","R2FKSR3Y4IRKD9","A1DDZTDK7NKWQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZTDK7NKWQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My keyboard linked up well with my iPad, and I played around with it, testing it's usefulness one night.Then, one week later, I took it to a meeting, and it didn't work. After, I brought it home, and connected it to another laptop, and got the same results. The batteries are fine, the bluetooth connection is solid, but most of the keys on the right side of the keyboard don't register at all on either iPad or Win7 laptop. This keyboard broke and was almost new. I never really used it, it only worked once for my setup test.Separately, I did not really like the typing experience. Yes, it is slightly better than typing directly into the iPad, and it allows you to prop the iPad up, facing you, while typing flat on a table. But it is useless without a table, since it is floppy. On the table, I just didn't like the 'feel' of the keyboard...kinda seems irrelevant since it's busted!!Given how many people have had quality issues, I'd steer clear of this one.REVISED: I bumped my rating up from 1 star to 3 because the vendor was very responsive and sent out a replacement.

"Hi, just a word of caution, I bought this card from Amazon, foolishly assuming it would fit in my PCI Express slots. It turns out it does not. Take careful note of the shape of the slots on this card. There is one wider and one narrower set of connectors (tabs) that drop into your motherboard. For this card, the narrower slot is closer to the rear of your PC, and the wider slot is closer to the front. This, I imagine, is the ""PCIe X4"" configuration (although I'm not sure). All I know is that my PC has  three PCI Express x1 slots, a PCI Express x16 slot for the graphics, and three PCI slots -- none of them a fit for this card.The slots that I though this would go into, on my PC, were wider tab at the rear and narrower tab to the front.

"The very best part of this mount is the suction cup platform disk with special bendable ""wings"", which can be stuck to your dash with the included 3M adhesive and alcohol wipe. This may seem like a small thing, but it is very important. Most of these disks are flat disks with double sided tape. The flat disk NEVER seems to contact well with a curved dash. But this mount's disk has five ""wings"" on the underside of the disk, which are flexible and can be bent to the shape of the dash, then stuck to it. Making contact between the adhesive and the dash truly separates this disk out from the pack, and is the difference between staying on, and falling off.This is an excellent universal mount for any kind of mobile device in your car. Universal mounts (IMHO) are better than dedicated (ex: iphone only) mounts, because as you upgrade your phone every 2 years, the same mount can still be used in the car.This mount works fine for my Nexus one, my wife's old iPhone 3GS, and her new iPhone 4. It also works with those phones naked, OR when those phones are in a gel or metal case. The bottom supports easily allow the wide iPhone plug to connect to the phone.The side arms, as in most similar mounts, can open and close to fit many devices. I measured their range as supporting phones with widths of from 1.5"" to 3.75"". The button to release and widen the side arms (spring loaded) is on the back. I prefer a side button, but I don't use it frequently.The side arms are angled in slightly, so that the phone is wedged up against the back, as well as squeezed in from the sides. I prefer to let the sides be a little loose, and just slip the phone in from the top. This way, you don't have to adjust the side arms.The strongest aspect of this particular product has to be the arm, suction cup, and dash disk portion of the mount. It is far better than many others I have tried and seen. It is very strong and highly adjustable. All joints (ball, pivot) can be tightened by the user, so once set, don't move. The hinge is ratcheting to hold very securely, and the ball mount allows 360 degrees of rotation, as well as swivel. The hinge pin can be removed and the 90 degree arm can be placed in upside-down, allowing for more choices of mounting position. The window suction cup holds strong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UNTRCOA4N31Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G7PIDA#wasThisHelpful","R1UNTRCOA4N31Z","A1DDZTDK7NKWQX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZTDK7NKWQX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Psychiatrist Morgan Winters is on the job. Brought in to try and help her local police department solve a murder case, she is determined to get the job done. Twists and turns along with her own practice and personal issues make Surrender a great addition to the suspense world.There is also a religious/spiritual thread that runs through this read. Morgan has to come to terms with her past as well as recent personal decisions making her take ownership of her own moral code and expectations, all the while trying to navigate the maze of suspects in this New Orleans murder case.The plot is a good one. I was guessing right up until the very end. There are so many twists and unexpected turns to navigate.My only negative, if you can call it that, is I wish there was more: more inner dialogue, more in-depth emotion, and a more fleshed out backstory to the captivating Morgan Winters. I feel as if author Jill Collins is on to something here with her Morgan Jane Winter series, and Iâ€™m hoping for the next installment to be a beefier, more emotionally raw read. She has all the components and I am excited to see where she goes from here.All in all, a solid 4 star read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REDG5D47JTV65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0101762TE#wasThisHelpful","REDG5D47JTV65","AEAFST0PI00MZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEAFST0PI00MZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received the ring set very quickly. Within a week of the order being placed.  I have worn them for two days now, taking them off when washing my hands and showering. So far the rings haven't turned color or lost any stones. This is costume jewelry, so if you are looking for a realistic, all-the-time wear ring I would opt for a set in sterling silver. These are plated, with extended wear and tons of hand washing I am sure keeping the finish would be a problem. But for strictly fashion and occasional wearing I am positive this set will work well.I have added pictures of the ring set in lamp light and natural light so you can see just how pretty the setting is.*Item received from Bamoerjewelry","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39CGL7MS01ESH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPUP49S#wasThisHelpful","R39CGL7MS01ESH","AEAFST0PI00MZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEAFST0PI00MZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the BEST PNR series to come along in eons! Thereâ€™s action, witty banter, sexy alphas, kick-ass females with a winning combination of sexual tension and explosive confrontations of the mind. I absolutely loved this wicked read!No mussing or fussing about. From the very beginning you are thrown into the fray. Daire finds himself giving in to temptation for the nightâ€¦ or at least he thinks he is. Caught unaware with the petite, beautiful female, the enforcer finds himself drugged, his pristine office and pride vandalized.Cee Cee is on a mission, she just never counted on being waylaid by the Enforcer. She feels alive for the first time in decades, but Daire is a distraction she canâ€™t afford if she is to finally seek the vengeance she desires.Truly one of the best reads of 2015 for me. Donâ€™t walk, RUN, to get The Realm Enforcers series! A must read for PNR fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DCRXIK5YL2RQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URQETIG#wasThisHelpful","R3DCRXIK5YL2RQ","AEAFST0PI00MZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEAFST0PI00MZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dear Colleen Hoover,I hate you.I hate you for making me go in blind reading November 9. I hate you for completely captivating me in such a way that I was forced to stay awake until 3:30AM so that I could finish reading November 9 in one sitting. I hate you for making me instantly love these characters so much that my heart almost burst with their potential. I hate you for making me anticipate each chapter so much that I found it hard to breathe at times. I hate that I cried for fictional characters. I hate that, to me, they became real. I hate you for making me gasp and scaring my dog at 2:15 am. I hate you for making me shut off my Kindle because I was so angry. I hate you for making me turn it back on at 2:30 because I was tossing and turning and just couldnâ€™t wait to see how this played out. I hate you for making me laugh so much I almost woke up my husband who had to get up in two hours and needed the rest. I hate that even though I was angry at times, you made me love it anyway.I hate you.I hate you for making November 9 a book I cant stop thinking about. I hate to say that I will be re-reading it today. I am tired, Colleen Hoover - and itâ€™s all your fault. Now hurry up and write something else.

"This is a cute little read with some hiccups. Meeting in a comic book store, Reese and Adam strike up a friendship over the development of a comic book. It feels a bit rudimentary in its writing style. Itâ€™s not bad by any means; it just seems to be missing that extra oomph. I wanted to know more of the inner dialogue Reese and Carter would be having in terms of the obstacles their blossoming relationship has. And on that note, I really hope the cover changes. The current cover doesnâ€™t fit the storytelling of what Reese looks like. It needs to be authentic to its character description. I just see a really tan white guy.All in all it is a fun, short read that left me with a smile on my face.

"Game On book number three! If you think for one minute that this author has lost her steam, dropped the ball, or even phoned it in, youâ€™re in for a big surprise! I have spent the day with Dex and Fi, and Iâ€™m currently suffering from one of the biggest book hangovers I have had in a while. I just canâ€™t put my finger on what specifically it is about Callihanâ€™s writing that pulls me in, infuses my heart with love, and thrills me with such a powerful connection and palpable drive to just keep reading. Un-put-down-able? Sure, that word has been thrown around before - how aboutâ€¦I got carpel tunnel from the grabby hands when The Game Plan is released? A fever was induced when Dex did nothing but stand there. Am I fangirling a bit? Sure I am. I donâ€™t think consistent and improving authors get the credit they deserve some times. Kristen Callihan is headed straight to my insta-click-author list.Fi and Dex are combustible in a slow burning I-will-wait-for-you kind of love. As much as itâ€™s escapism at its best, itâ€™s also a realistic love story, and for me that just ups the game.We also get a welcome look into the current lives of Anna and Drew, as well as Grey and Ivy.

"Hot sex and great leading men are becoming trademarks of Katana Collinsâ€™s writing. Fun, witty and filled with sarcastic banter, her books are an insta click for sure.Jessica has decided that she will do anything to find her sistersâ€™ killer/killers. Even if it means submerging herself in a world that she never expected to find herself in. Masters and subs play games Jessica just cant seem to get a handle on. Add in drugs and murderâ€¦. Well, youâ€™ve got an erotic cocktail of mystery to solve.There are multiple POVâ€™s. I think I counted five? And without a notice of perspective change, it could be a bit confusing. I found myself re-reading at times just to make sure who was who. Itâ€™s such a good mystery that I didnâ€™t want to miss anything. I mentally changed who I thought the killer was 3 times!!!I am also excited to see a chance of more books, or at least a spin off in this series.

"The first half of this book was on friggin FIRE! Love, hate, vengeful seething emotions with heart breaking yearning, and a need too strong to ignoreâ€¦ just GAH!! I have never been so turned on and so heartbroken all at once. Itâ€™s a purely visceral read for me in the beginning. I could not stop devouring this book. Really, itâ€™s some of KAâ€™s best work to date.The second half returns to a more subdued feel. Not all tied up in a pretty bow, but diving into the more meat of the Chaos series that has been put on the backburner from the Dream Man Series. I like the stronger return of this plotline. Especially since it brings in more of my other favorite sexy leading men from before.Itâ€™s a total 5 Star read for me.

"What an amazing read! Truly, the Guardians of the Realms series has hit its stride. I was absolutely glued to the pages. Its intense, creative, and magnetic coupling of Delia and Drake is one of the best duos thus far in the series.Author Setta Jay is developing a family of characters in her Guardians world that has the potential to become one of the best PNR series around. The more I get into the series the more I want to know. Adding in the secondary characters paralleling the main couple is a fantastic way of keeping up with the â€œfamâ€ and I love it!Book number seven has just blown its predecessors out of the water. Mighty dragons, mystical mist, and sultry nights combine into one epic read. Searing Ecstasy is a dark, uplifting, and erotic read and, quite frankly, one of Jayâ€™s best works to date.Oh and P.S. the last paragraphâ€¦. O.M.G!!

"Cracking good read! Get it? Cause it's called Nuts! .....yeah, yeah I know :PItâ€™s with a jovial heart that I say that Nuts by Alice Clayton has been one of the most enjoyable reads I have read all year! Easy lovinâ€™, uproariously funny, and so tantalizing itâ€™s impossible to put down! I mean, come on! Farmers have never been so sexy.Private chief Roxie is leaving California for the summer to bail out her mother, yet again. It comes at a perfect time, really. Her job has just hit the skids. One bad night at work gets her fired and soon her client list crumbles. So a long drive cross-country to get her head together just might be the help she needs before Roxie lands back in upstate New York.The small town that Roxie couldnâ€™t leave fast enough after graduation, is now her new summer destination. Only Roxie is seeing things from a new perspective and with a different set of eyes. People arenâ€™t who she thought they were. Truly, are any of us who we were in high school? With growth and age comes a bit of understanding.The one bright, bearded perk of being home is the mouth-watering guy that brings the produceâ€¦ and the fruitâ€¦ and the nutsâ€¦ you should see his zucchini. Organic farmer Leo just made coming home a lot more interesting. A series of bumbles, trips, and falls attributes to the laugh-out-loud introduction of these two.What harm could a little summer lovinâ€™ cause? I mean,who wouldnâ€™t want their own Sandy and Danny moment right? Right. â€œSummer Loving, had me a blastâ€¦.â€The brilliance that created Wallbanger is back and better than ever!

She left town once, for college, but barely made it through the semester. She has resided to the fact this is kind of it for her.A blast from the past, Jake, just showed up out of the blue; the clear blue sky that is. A pilot now, and the only guy Lacey ever really loved. His no nonsense, say-whatâ€™s-on-your-mind, straight talking, sexy self is back. The chemistry is stronger than ever.Itâ€™s a wonderful second chance romance, and one Iâ€™m already excited to read again.

"Quickly becoming one of my favorites Kristen Callihanâ€™s Game On series doesnâ€™t disappoint. Nothing is more appealing than good guysâ€¦. Well sexy, smart and charismatic good guys that once they know what they want arenâ€™t afraid to do anything to get it. Or her as the case may be.Gray and Ivy start off their relationship texting from two different countries to becoming face to face friends and slowly turn into much more. They are beyond funny and absolutely perfect for each other.The best part of The Friend Zone is the journey they both go through deciding what it is they really want to do with their lives and careers. That parents can mold and help along that path but ultimately they themselves must decide what feels right. A great coming of age/new adult read. Real and honest with childish drama and angst left at the door.Laugh out loud, snarky, witty and oh so sexy.

"First, I must say that you are listening to a very biased reviewer. In case you didnâ€™t know, my co-blogger and I are military wives. We have a very up close and personal connection to the men and women in uniform. Therefore anytime we can help or facilitate our armed forces we step up, stand up, and commit. Itâ€™s what we are programmed to do.So needless to say, that when I saw a book by Suzanne Brockmann and then found out that all author and publisher proceeds will go to the Wounded Warrior Project, I was IMMEDIATELY on board.All eight stories center on people in uniform and a love connection. Some are warm, fun, and sexy. Others are heartbreaking, gritty and gripping. War isnâ€™t easy. The warrior has to be emotionally strong while being physically strong as well, and as for the loved ones at home?

"3.5(ish)Starsâ€œSo it's gonna be foreverOr it's gonna go down in flamesYou can tell me when it's overIf the high was worth the painCause we're young and we're recklessWe'll take this way too farIt'll leave you breathlessOr with a nasty scarâ€So yeah, the lyrics to Taylor Swiftsâ€™ Blank Space kind of resonate with my feelings after reading the second and final book of Cassie and Ethan. What a ride! After that cliffhanger for an ending in Bad Romeo I was ready to find out how this would end with these two: forever or down in flames.Again, we spend time in the juxtaposition of past and present. As I said before, I like present Ethan waaaaaay more than past Ethan. Itâ€™s enjoyable to see the man verses the boy. Bold determination is a sexy, heady thing.Itâ€™s also sad and disheartening to see the once spirited and hopeful Cassie so jaded, broken and caustic about life. Itâ€™s an embattled balance of love, heartache, redemption and revitalization. Although, at times I hated the past journey, I needed to experience it to fully embrace the tenderness of the present.â€œI got a blank space baby, and I'll write your nameâ€Couldnâ€™t resist *Giggle snort*","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QR0GKTVOBAHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O79HOGI#wasThisHelpful","R1QR0GKTVOBAHY","AEAFST0PI00MZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEAFST0PI00MZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Give me humor with my romance and I will follow you into the deep end of the pool!The Mistake is my kind of NA romance; a little angst, a little sexy and a whole lotta funny. Logan is still crushing on his best friendâ€™s girl when, by mistake, he meets the lovely but quirky Grace. They spend a surprisingly great evening together however the â€œgood byeâ€ ends up being an awkward bit of a mess.For whatever reason, Logan just canâ€™t get over Grace or his somewhat humiliating goodbye to her. What culminates is a fun and fulfilling start to a great friendship/romance. That is, until the lovable yet clueless Logan opens his massive mouth and sticks his ice skating foot right in it.Grace canâ€™t believe she just opened herself up to be the most vulnerable she has ever been with someone and gets slammed in the gut with words she never thought to hear in that particular situation. Have no fear ladies! Our Grace ainâ€™t no doormat! Wellâ€¦. not anymore. She takes her life and her self-respect and pulls herself up and into the woman she can and needs to be. If Logan truly wants her back and wants to prove himself he has to earn it and make amends.The Mistake is a laugh out loud journey. As funny as it is, I gotta say, there are some extremely touching moments. I shed tears for Logan. He isnâ€™t all he seems on the outside. His family life is far from perfect and you get an insight into the kind of childhood that shaped the person he is today.Funny, moving, endearing and a positively terrific follow up book in the Off-Campus Series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EHQQNHJUXK3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WASWK7Q#wasThisHelpful","R1EHQQNHJUXK3B","AEAFST0PI00MZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEAFST0PI00MZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Forensic photographer and sister of the deceased, Jessica must take an unexpected journey into the darker side of sex to find out what happened to her sister.Twists and turns abound as slowly evidence surfaces.

"Going in blind with just a snippet from Trick really did make all the difference. I was able to follow the good doctor, Darby Carmichael, along her journey of patient turned friendship turned more. Funny and captivating, Only Trick is a sexy mystery wrapped in intrigue.I really enjoyed spending time with a heroine that refused to be a door mat. She stood her ground and voiced what she would and would not put up with. Just because Trick was beautiful and every woman threw herself at him didnâ€™t change the fact that Darby has a standard of self-preservation. Sheâ€™s not gonna be a doormat or sit idly by, which makes for some amazingly delicious confrontations between these two.Trick was complicated and we get just enough of his POV to make it intriguing and draw more curiosity into who he really is.I know, Iâ€™m not telling you much and Iâ€™m being somewhat vague, but guys, just read it and donâ€™t over think it. It would be easy to spoil it if too much is given away.

So much was crammed into the pages of THE UNLEASHING that it is hard to breathe between the action and adventure.Kera and Vig make an equally amazing couple. Sexy funny has been and will always be my absolute favorite kind of read. Have no doubts that this measures up. I donâ€™t want to give much away, as I feel the best books are better when you go in blind, but I will say the pursuit/stalkerish behavior was just fab!Now, having said all the lovely gushing things above, I gotta say there is A LOT to take in.

I was worried that this series was starting to get stale. You would think that after eleven books I would I tire of it all. Nope, Nuh-uh, not happening. It is still fun, fresh and hella sexy.Mase Colt-Manning is such a modern day southern gentleman. His inner monologue is as funny as it is steamy. Gentle, caring, and protective is the perfect description for him.As for the lovely Reese, her childhood is a terrifying one. Still recovering and learning to trust, sheâ€™s cleaning houses for a living. When Mase uncovers one of her hidden shames, everything changes. Any adult dealing with a learning disability tends to struggle more so than a child. Especially if it has never been properly diagnosed or addressed.

" 3:29 Mins Pros:- Sound Quality: Great sound quality for its size. With 8W driver, the speaker can fill a small room or a small outdoors pool area with sound. However it may not be loud enough for taking to the beach which is a wider area.- Suction Cup: OMG! this thing can stick on anything from my forehead to the shower wall. Just stick it, and start the shower party.- It floats: Yes! this is a floating,waterproof, Bluetooth enabled speaker. That means go to the pool and just let it float around while playing music from your phone via Bluetooth.- Waterproof: Nowadays everyone claims their product is waterproof, but many fail in reaching the full waterproof status. However the Gshine SiRen is IPX7 proof that means you can submerge it one meter in the water for 30 minutes and the speaker will be just fine.Improvements:- More Colors: The speaker comes in only one color (black) making it a bit boring.

"These pot holders were received as a free gift. They are silky smooth to the touch and it's nice to have a pair instead of just one. They are pretty to look at and the nubs that provide extra heat guard are adorable little hearts. Without the heart nubs, however, the gloves are fairly thin when compared to other silicone pot holders.I learned the hard way that if I pull something hot from the oven and happen to grip the pan in an area where there is no silicone heart coverage then I will get burned or at least it will be very hot to the touch. I couldn't grip long enough to pull the pan and gently set it on the stove, I had to drop it quickly.It might improve the quality if the company adds more raised nubs to the glove or makes the smooth part of the glove thicker.On a positive note however, these gloves can also be re-purposed for other typical kitchen tasks such as opening jars, putting underneath pots and bowls to prevent slipping, and wrapping the glove around garlic and onions to help remove the peel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E8KT47VXZ3Q6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ZRDCZS#wasThisHelpful","R3E8KT47VXZ3Q6","A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:08 Mins The PECHAM C26 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker was close in meeting my expectations, but it's not the ultimate rugged Bluetooth speaker. PECHAM c26 looks rugged and it absorbs the shock of a drop, thanks to the rubber surrounding the speaker. However, nowhere in the manual or the product description page was I able to find the actual IPX rating of the speaker. I contacted the company to gather this info and received no answer (I assume poor customer service).â€‹I didn't want to fully submerge it into water so I tested it against a splashing water at the beach and it did great. I am assuming its rating is at least IPX4 or IPX5.Sound Quality:â€‹PECHAM C26 has a total output of 10W which is very loud for its size. When playing music on maximum volume the sound will cover a large room size and a poolside party. There are, however, a few flaws to having big sound without the proper execution. For example when a song has a strong bass the speaker starts to have some distortion when used on high volume.- Clarity of Sound  â˜…â˜…â˜… when the music is only vocals and mid-range the speaker has crystal clear sound, but once the bass starts kicking in you will hear a little bit (very little)  of distortion which affects the clarity of the sound.- Vocals and Mid Range  â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…- Bass  â˜…â˜…â˜…- Overall Sound Quality - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…Design and Features:Although the speaker has the typical design that many sellers on Amazon use, it looks and feels rugged.

Other features worth mentioning:â€‹â€‹- Flashlight -  This speaker has a built-in flashlight that can be turned on with a press of a button. This is a great addition especially because it is an outdoors speaker.- Water and Shock Resistant - The product listing on Amazon describes the speaker as ""waterproof."" However, as discussed earlier in this post there is no indication of the actual IPX rating, which could confuse the consumer. Remember water resistant is not waterproof and this speaker is NOT waterproof, only water resistant.- â€‹Overall Design - â˜…â˜…â˜…â€‹Improvements:- IPX Rating - providing the actual IPX rating to the consumer is a very important piece of information.

"What I like about this spray is that it has minimal ingredients which appear harmless for my dog to ingest such as baking soda and Aloe Vera, and contains no alcohol. I also like the quick shot foam which is easy to apply when your dog is not being cooperative. Once sprayed on to the teeth it sticks to the teeth and gums. No brushing is required. What I donâ€™t like is that the dispenser shoots out too much foam which actually dribbles out of my dogsâ€™ mouth onto the floor causing much of the product to be wasted. Also, even though humans prefer the freshness of peppermint and spearmint, I believe dogs would much prefer the fresh taste of chicken. This product works immediately in reducing bad breath, but needs to be used 1-2 times per day in order to sustain breath freshness.

"I love the small soft gel I always had Vitamin D as a capsule and they are usually big and hard to swallow for me, so this was a great solution for that problem.

Olive oil has a lower smoke point than vegetable oil because it has a lower fat content than vegetable.I received a complimentary sample of this product for my honest and unbiased feedback","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G13FJX7G7M9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQKI3W6#wasThisHelpful","R3G13FJX7G7M9C","A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The perfect desktop speaker! And by this I mean, if you're looking for a speaker to take to the beach this may not be the one for you. If by chance you aren't getting out for a vacation this summer, then the Eachine BAR Portable Bluetooth Wireless may just make your time at the office a little more pleasant.Pros:- Sleek Design: This speaker will look great on your desk or anywhere you place it. Comes in 5 appealing colors, black, black/red, white/red, red/grey, and blue/green.- 3.5mm audio port for non-Bluetooth devices.- 15 Hours continuous playtime: powered by a built-in rechargeable 2200mAh Li-ion battery.- Multi-use speaker: The Eachine is also an FM radio, alarm clock, and has phone call capability leaving your hands free to continue working on the computer. Displays time in 24h with LCD screen. Includes supporting TF card, USB flash disk, and 3.5mm audio port.Easy to use: Simply turn on/off with a switch on the back of the speaker. Enable your Bluetooth setting on your device, pair with the speaker in less than 30 seconds and voilÃ !Sound Quality:As mentioned before, this speaker is not for outdoor use and is better appreciated at close range such as at a desk or in a small room. After experiencing a variety of music, I noted that even though the speakers are advertised as having 3W audio drivers and subwoofer the deep base music lacks some body with this speaker.  Also at maximum volume the sound is not very loud, so if you like to feel your music in your chest, you might be disappointed.Acoustic guitar sounds and vocals, however, come through crisp and clear. If you happen to be a country music fan, you will be very impressed with this speaker. Phone calls on this speaker are effective, but again you will want to stay within a close range during conversations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MJVQCPPC477S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1R4I2U#wasThisHelpful","R2MJVQCPPC477S","A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Green Earth Pan by Ozeri is a dream come true. It states it is free of PTFE and PFOA chemicals which are believed to be harmful when consumed.Ozeri has done an excellent job of creating a non-stick coating that is ceramic based. The honeycombed shaped ridges in the pan allow for even heating and most likely also assist with preventing food from sticking.It is important to read and follow instructions to keep the pan in good working condition. I have only used this pan for a few weeks so I am not sure how this pan fares in the long term. Several other users of this pan have commented that the non-stick technology wears off in the long term.I suspect that using the pan on high heat regularly may eventually cause damage to the non-stick coating. Also frequent frying might damage the coating over time. It may be best to use this pan on the lowest heat possible since it is designed to distribute the heat evenly. Also be frugal with the amount of oil you use in the pan, but do use a little bit as mentioned in the directions. I have used this pan to make spectacular omelets. I was worried that the meat drippings and sauce that dried in the pan during cooking would not come out, but I simply soaked it in water for several hours or overnight and it easily wiped off. I own a couple of other ceramic coated pans that are white on the inside, and while they get the job done the Ozeri feels more heavy duty and capable of withstanding larger cooking jobs. I am very pleased with the performance of this pan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262P4STRKX34D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005473FMO#wasThisHelpful","R262P4STRKX34D","A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The headphones are designed to stay in place during an entire workout session so you can concentrate on the workout instead of wasting time trying to adjust the headphones.- Flexible/Foldable headband - I've had many experiences where headphones meant to be worn around the neck have a tough/non flexible band that can be extremely annoying. The Swage Sport however, have solved this issue by creating a flexible headband which sets perfectly against your neck to keep the headphones in place.- Battery Life -  With 10 to 12 hours of battery life you can get through a few workouts before needing to recharge.- Sound Quality - The sound quality has some room for improvement, especially for users that like loud bass. Still, for being workout, Bluetooth you can count on them to help you get into your BEAST MODE!!Improvements:- Carrying Case - I wish there was a carrying case, or even a cloth.

"I am in love with this phone! Believe it or not I gave my LG G3 away to use this phone instead. Why? because ""flagships"" phones are overrated, and thanks to BLU now I have a phone that does way better job than any other Samsung, LG, Sony, and HTC phones I owned.If you think I am over reacting or over selling this phone check out why I like the BLU Studio Energy?- Battery Life - the most annoying thing about flagship phones is the stupidly short battery life. My LG G3 used to die by noon if I don't charge it. This phone BLU Studio Energy has the best, and the longest battery life in a phone ever. Even though the phone has 5.0"" HD IPS Display.- I can charge other devices using this phone? What? this is absolutely ingenious! reverse charging works great I charged my smartwatch, and my friend's dying phone, and I still had enough juice to get through few more hours.- Great quality display - Even though the display is only 300ppi it has a beautiful quality, bright and easy to see in any light settings.- Included Silicon case, and screen protector - This just shows how much BLU cares about their customers. You will never find a flagship phone (LG, Samsung, and all the other they think they are cool manufactures) with an included protective case, and screen protector.- The Android software is smooth, and not slow. I swear to the technology Gods, and Goddesses, this BLU Studio Energy phone outperformed my LG G3, and Galaxy S4 in regard of speed when opening apps, and browsing.Look I can go all day, talking good things about this phone because it is AWESOME!! Don't let the fancy unneeded features such as Air Gestures, Laser Stabilizing Camera, IR Blaster,and other Shenanigans lauer you to buy a flagship phone, it is just useless. You will never use those features.This phone has all you need in a smartphone, with a long battery life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R310EUX103MAM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6J3V52#wasThisHelpful","R310EUX103MAM3","A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I know you might be saying no way!

" 6:59 Mins The creators at BACtrack are considered heroes for some. They have been working diligently, for more than a decade, on enabling individuals to check their own blood alcohol level.  BACtrack was the first FDA approved personal use breathalyzer, and was featured on shows like The Doctors, Dr Phil, and Mythbusters to name a few.BACtrack Mobile, Why You Should Buy It?The BACtrack Mobile breathalyzer, or any BACtrack breathalyzer in general, is a very practical item to own.  Having the option to connect it to your smartphone enriches the awesomeness, and the ingenuity of this valuable gadget.PROS:- Good visibility -Once connected to your smartphone BACtrack Mobile is no longer restricted to a small built-in screen (which might be hard to see when you are under the influence), but instead will have big, bright, and easy to see results.- Countdown to sobriety-I love that the app gives you the ability to see your past results, and uses that information to determine your ZeroLine, a patented technology by BACtrack which determines how long it takes your blood alcohol level to drop to 0.00%. This feature knows me better than I know myself. ZeroLine  predicted an accurate time frame for me to reach sobriety almost every time I used it. If at any time the prediction was inaccurate it was most likely because I didn't drink enough water.- Small and rechargeable- This device is truly mobile.  It is small enough to fit in your pocket and the included carrying case makes it even more mobile. Recharge it using the included micro-USB cable (battery life varies depending on usage)- Sanitary - It comes with three mouthpieces so you don't share it with people (don't be nasty!) and you can buy more mouthpieces here. Past users have shared that you can use a straw, and it works equally well.- Accurate - Thanks to some friends who work in law enforcement, we were able to compare the BACtrack's results to a device commonly used in public safety. We got the same results! This is because, BACtrack Mobile uses Police-Grade XtendÂ® Fuel Cell Sensor Technology (A fancy way to say it's accurate). To learn more about this technology check out this page.IMPROVEMENTS:One drawback that I was able to find with BACtrack Mobile is that if your phone dies, you're out of luck.  This breathalyzer is practically useless without a phone. However, it is really easy to borrow someones else phone and install the app. It takes literally less than one minute to connect the breathalyzer to any phone after installing the app. Maybe including a built-in screen that can be turned off when the breathalyzer is connected to the phone to preserve battery could fix this.In Summary:The accuracy of BACtrack Mobile is astonishing. The features, the design, and the app are like a team that complete each other.  Remember, BACtrack should be used to determine the alcohol level in the blood to give you a time frame for sobriety and allow you to monitor your drinking habits. It should not be used to determine if you can drive or not, as having any alcohol in your blood can impair driving. For it's practically flawless features, we give BACtrack Mobile the perfect 5 TechPicks stars â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1324EQZGYBB0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP9SJ56#wasThisHelpful","R1324EQZGYBB0G","A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6FGO4TBZ3QFZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 3:37 Mins Sound Quality:Not to bash any other manufacturers, but lately many companies have been introducing audio products with sound, bass, treble, etc... enhancement. All of these enhancements are actually a feature consumers look for when purchasing headphones/speakers, and to be completely honest I was one of those consumers.When looking to purchase an audio product, the bass enhancement  feature was a top priority until I listened to music with a set of Grain Audio over the ear headphones. I was surprised how much sound detail I have been missing.The sound quality of Grain Audio OEHP.01  recreates  an accurate representation of the music exactly as was intended by the musician during the recording. Grain Audio OEHP.01 changed my entire perspective of what should be considered when judging characteristics of sound.  These headphones have set a new standard for me when it comes to sound quality.The transparent, easy to hear sound, with sharp time response, and no distortion, (which is comparable to clarity and reveals all aspects of detail) is achieved by Grain Audio's  proprietary driver that features a Neodymium magnet and a CCAW voice coil.Design:These headphones look unique, and authentic. The oil finished Walnut wood is the centerpiece of these beautiful headphones.The leather ear cups, the cable, and the rest of the frame has a light grey color which enhances the look of the wood.In addition, this design did not compromise comfort. The headphones are very light and extremely comfortable. The memory foam padded ear cups hug the ears gently, and eliminate pressure on the ear when wearing the headphones for long hours. These ears cups can also create a great isolation for noise cancellation.Improvements: The Grain Audio OEHP  has a sound quality, and comfort that makes it the quintessential headset. For better mobile experience, however, the company might consider making the cable jack  an L/elbow shape .In Summary:If you are looking for the ultimate sound experience you must try Grain Audio OEHP. These headphones are truly a complete package with amazingly accurate sound quality,unique design, and comfort.

"There's a saying, ""Just because it's simple doesn't mean it's easy,"" and the inverse of that saying applies well to this book.On the surface, it's a ~200-page novella of short chapters and abundant white space, in which a woman recalls a time in the mid-1980s that brought a short reconciliation with her estranged mother and the chance to be curious and better understand both the family she grew up in and the family she co-created.Strout's gentle, reflective narrative is so easy to read that it threatens to be unsatisfying in an ""Is that all there is?"" way. But at the same time, its vignette-ish chapters seem oblique and, having read two of Strout's previous books, I knew of course that isn't all there is.

"Iâ€™m giving this two stars because, on a first sip/swallow, this cranberry/raspberry water tastes lively and refreshing. For some people, that may continue. But for me, it then turned into a watered-down juice with a strong artificial note (the raspberry, I think) that persisted harshly on my taste buds.I use cranberry juice with water and ice when I make cosmo martinis, so I tried one with this cranberry water and it did not taste good (maybe the raspberry aspect; maybe the sweetness). So whether on its own or in the martini, I didnâ€™t get past a few swallows before throwing it away. Since the deal-breaker for me seemed to be the raspberry, I might give the passion fruit or blood orange (two favorites) flavors a try.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K863U1K4Z5U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSC3B4O#wasThisHelpful","R1K863U1K4Z5U9","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I keep this 6-inch cable in my car. It connects through an adapter that plugs into the carâ€™s cigarette lighter and charges my iPhone 6s just fine. Or, it connects to the USB wire installed in the console between the front seats and plays audio through the aux system. In both cases, the cable is just long enough to let my phone lay flat on a nearby surface.To use it during hotel stays (connected through an adapter that plugs into an AC outlet) is slightly trickier. If thereâ€™s an outlet on a tabletop/desk lamp, the cable is long enough to let me lay the phone near the lamp and itâ€™s fine. But if the only electrical access is a wall outlet, the short cable makes the phone just hang -- unless I make a little stack of something (e.g. books, shoes, etc.) beneath the outlet and lay the phone on top of that.Belkin cables are thicker and sturdier than Apple versions, but this one is only slightly thicker, thus more aesthetically elegant than other Belkins Iâ€™ve had.

"This is a sweet, creamy, light-milk chocolate, very fresh, with crunchy hazelnuts and almonds and chewy raisins that give contrasting textures to the smooth chocolate.

"Since March 2000, Iâ€™ve been using a sealed foil pouch to cook a delicious shrimp/basil/feta/orzo recipe from Cooking Light magazine (search the site, the recipe is still there). In the beginning, I used Reynoldsâ€™ foil oven bags. When they discontinued the bags about 10 years ago, I started making my own pouches by folding a length of heavy-duty foil in half and sealing the three open sides. Not much work at all, yet I longed for the bag every single time and have periodically looked for it in stores.So Iâ€™m thrilled to see itâ€™s back! Itâ€™s approx. 10x15-in in size, fits nicely on a â€œhalf-sheetâ€-size cookie/baking sheet, and is at least as substantial as heavy-duty foil from a roll. Has a slight decorative pattern on the surface. The open end is on a short side, which takes some getting used to: itâ€™s a little clumsier to fill/serve through the narrow end; on the other hand, itâ€™s easier to seal the narrow end.

No first words of stories have captured me as quickly as each of these, and then held me their whole lengths, with their rural southwestern Michigan settings and lower-middle-class characters. I was chilled by their collective (and a bit repetitive) theme of womenâ€™s and girlsâ€™ vulnerability to men, and more so by the lengths women go to in avoiding and recovering from those harms.Campbellâ€™s stories remind me of Jo Ann Beardâ€™s (The Boys of My Youth), although Campbellâ€™s settings are a little bleaker and her characters a little rougher/tougher (at least on the outside).

"""---Dad, he says, with a kind swerve in his voice...""I can hear it -- that swerve nearly separating â€œDadâ€ into two syllables. Thatâ€™s Colum McCann, whose lyrical stories practically read themselves.Here heâ€™s assembled a novella and three short stories, each of which explores looking through different perspectives. In the stories, thereâ€™s the mind of a writer as he creates and bends and prunes a story; there's a nun who catches sight of the man, now renown, who raped her decades before; and there's a translatorâ€™s struggle to find, in any language, an equivalent to the Hebrew word, â€œshâ€™kholâ€ (a parent whose child has died), even as she deals with her own missing son. In the novella, a day in an octogenarianâ€™s life is interpreted through the lenses of numerous surveillance cameras.""[The detectives] will comb through the [camera] images looking for any random detail [...] The more obscure the moment, the more valuable the knowledge. [...] They work in much the same way as poets: the search for a random word, at the right instance, making the poem itself so much more precise.""Again, thatâ€™s McCann, who excels at finding the telling detail. This shorter collection wasnâ€™t as immersive as his 2009 Let the Great World Spin (ten stories linked through shared characters and a connection to Phillippe Petitâ€™s 1974 high-wire walk between the World Trade Centerâ€™s Twin Towers). But like every McCann story Iâ€™ve read, these touch gently on important topics via memorable characters, and each was individually satisfying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OO9KIGCSNUMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812996720#wasThisHelpful","R3OO9KIGCSNUMH","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This isn't my highest-rated of the four At-a-Glance planners I've used, but it's my favorite.It's extremely ""clean"" in design, with a cover that's visually simple but nicely tactile due to a faux sueded-leather that feels like nubuck. The spiral binding allows the planner to lay open and completely flat, or to be folded open, front cover to back, to lay flat at just half the width. I really like the ""nubuck"" cover, but it does sometimes drag against the spiral binding which makes it clumsy to close.The visual simplicity continues inside, where each tabbed month begins with a 2-page calendar spread of the month, followed by 2-page spreads for each week, and here each day of the week gets its own square-ish box instead of the typical vertical columns. I like that, since my days are currently filled more with task lists and notes than specific appointment times. I also like that Saturday and Sunday each get space equal to the weekdays, and that there's an area for the week's Notes. The pages are white with gray lines and a tiny orange font. Again, though I like that ""clean-ness,"" the font is hard to read and the lack of margins or borders at the page perimeters (see product images) makes it look a bit unfinished.The best feature of this planner is something I haven't seen in my other At-a-Glance planners -- its last page is a clear plastic sheet with two half-height pockets, one on each side! For me, a pocket is essential and if a planner doesn't have one, I make my own and tape it in.In summary, this is an academic-year planner (13 months: July 2015 through July 2016) with a clean, upscale feel that makes me eager for July to get here!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MVO46LWUPDSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCC6XZM#wasThisHelpful","R2MVO46LWUPDSW","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the authors:""[Graphic d]esign is not decoration but, rather, the intelligent solution of conceptual problems; it is the manipulation of type, image, and, most of all, the presentation of ideas that convey a message.""It was from IDEO CEO Tim Brown that I first heard stressed that design is not a tweak, made near the end of a process to fine-tune or make pretty, but rather is a substantive, beginning-to-end way of thinking. It discourages me to see that designers still have to fight that characterization. But this book encourages me, with its collection of Q&As with ~80 designers, and hundreds of full-color examples of their work, that showcase the substantive contributions of graphic design.The subtitle says it's ""A Guide to Careers in Design,"" but I think it's closer to ""An *Exposure* to Careers in Design,"" specifically graphic design. It's not a mind-focusing, how-to book; it's a mind-blowing primer on possibilities. It exposes the potential design student to a wide variety of content such as design genres and sub-genres, print and digital, from fonts to images to layouts and entire installations. It touches on design markets like publishing, packaging, commerce and advertising. It also considers the workplace experience as an employee vs. independent vs. with partner, and how to stay inspired and motivated.As a reader and writer, I enjoy author interviews for their behind-the-curtain peeks at other creatives at work.

"This is a very attractive water bottle, made of high-quality materials. If you have a zero-tolerance for leaks/spillage of any kind under any circumstances, its design makes it an outstanding water bottle. But if you just want a spill-resistant bottle for use on-the-go, look elsewhere because the design of this one, specifically its cap, makes it very complicated to clean. Moreover, while it seems designed to prevent spills from very young children who will tip, shake and even throw bottles, it seems way too big and heavy for such young children.The bottle itself and the straw, which disconnects from the cap, are simple to clean. But the leak-proof aspects of the cap necessitate countless hinges, valves and fittings that require detailed attention to separate and clean. I've only filled my bottle with water, never anything that could add a residue that supports bacterial growth, and even then the cleaning seems tedious. The bottle is too big to fit in the holder on my bicycle, so I take it to my workout classes, where it's easy to carry on the hook of a finger and I can sip through the straw rather than having to tilt my head back and squirt water from above.

"I don't consider writers to be ""Favorite Authors"" until I've especially enjoyed at least two books by them. This is my second by Keret, and yep! -- he's been Favorite-d.My first was his latest collection of flash fiction, which delighted me with surreal premises and imaginative twists. This book is a collection of 36 similarly short pieces, but here they're memoir-ish essays about the titular seven years between the birth of his son and the death of his father. They're not only poignantly optimistic, they're often outright funny.His observations from Tel Aviv on family -- his Holocaust-survivor parents, adored older brother and ultra-orthodox sister; his lioness wife and wise, tender young son -- stun me with their guy-next-door universality. They remind me of other writers whose landscape is family and humor, e.g. David Sedaris. But those others don't have stories of family road trips interrupted by air-raid sirens and the need to stop and lie at the side of the road until the bomb explodes, all the while distracting the frightened son by recasting the situation, Life-Is-Beautiful-like, as a game of ""pastrami sandwich"" where the child is protected between the adults.Plus, it's a treat to read Miranda July's Q&A with Keret in the opening pages. Considering they're two of the most unique writers I've encountered, I especially liked this:""The best trait I got from my mother is her confidence. Not the kind of confidence that makes you lead the rebels' attack on the death star, but [...] that your choices, no matter how strange and different they may be, are perfectly all right.

"I'm fascinated with insight and moments of awareness and have been thrilled by occurrences of it in my life. So I was interested to see this book-length work on the science of ""what happens in the brain at the instant when a person solves a problem with a flash of insight,"" and am happy to report that it's both informative and enjoyable.The authors describe insight, an unconscious thought process of quantum leaps that deliver a revolutionary idea in abrupt clarity, and contrast it with the conscious, deliberate, evolutionary process of analysis. They discuss the problem-solving styles of ""insightfuls"" and ""analysts"" (and the errors of omission and commission that they make when they run out of time when working out a problem; the insightfuls offering no solutions and the analysts offering half-baked solutions), and use EEG and fMRI data to describe what's going on in the brain and where.Then they devote perhaps half of the book to methods that increase insight, for example, getting as much life experience as possible (so as to better recognize patterns), taking a break/taking a nap (your unconscious will keep working the problem), scheduling your creative work for when you're typically tired (i.e. your censoring analyst is tired, allowing insights to bubble up), and further reducing the censor by developing a positive mindset and an unconstrained, long-term outlook.It's fascinating and a lot of fun to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R96W0MLAXPM7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400068541#wasThisHelpful","R96W0MLAXPM7R","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My favorite fiction format is a collection of linked short stories, where characters, settings, events and/or themes appear and reappear in lead and supporting roles in the various stories, and sometimes become more fascinating in the sideways glimpses of their supporting roles than when seen head-on. I didn't know it going in to this book, but this big novel is actually a collection of linked novellas. I loved it.They're linked through the title character, Radar Radmanovic (born in 1975 New Jersey) and a fascinating (and fictional?) branch of puppetry that takes the reader through time, geography, ethnicity and late-20th-century history. The linking is loose, the novellas nearly stand alone, but wow! Reif Larsen can write! His playful, curious, science-based (in this case, physics) narrative reminded me of Jeffrey Eugenides' Middlesex, and his insertion of photos, maps and other visuals amid the text reminded me of Michael Crichton's works.

"These 10-in and 12-in stainless-steel nonstick skillets are beautiful -- more beautiful than my Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick -- and I'm thrilled that they also cook well and clean up easily.I tested them with two of my go-to meals: grilled-cheese sandwiches and seared sirloin steaks. The skillets are thinner than the Calphalon, so I was worried about burning and possibly kept the heat too low -- the steaks looked great but didn't have the flavor that usually develops with the sear. (Looking again, I realized only the sides seem thin; the bottoms are heavyweight.) So I admit to being more attentive than usual when I tried the grilled cheese ... and they came out possibly my best batch in 25+ years! -- uniformly grilled all the way to the crusts, beautiful and flavorful, with no hint of overdone. (Plus, the 12-in skillet was roomy enough to grill my three (may even fit four) sandwiches at one time.) No sticking whatsoever, even the melted cheese, and easy to clean (I always hand wash).Do note: contrary to the current information on this page, these do NOT come with lids. Otherwise, a very nice set!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHN9IV5IRTNB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M31VM2E#wasThisHelpful","RHN9IV5IRTNB6","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have it programmed to light a lamp in an out-of-the-way area all evening, and the area looks so cozy now.Plus, it adds two features that my previous timers didn't have: 1) the instructions are printed on the back of the timer, making them always available (and they're quite intuitive); and 2) to operate whatever is plugged into the timer during the period it's scheduled to be off (without disrupting the schedule or unplugging anything), just slide a switch from ""Timer on"" to ""Outlet on"" (and then back to ""Timer on"" when you're done).I just ordered two more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MBGT4SEP5H69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002QB1AZA#wasThisHelpful","R3MBGT4SEP5H69","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy a glass of wine before dinner most nights and, despite using tight bottle stoppers, do notice the gradual decline in flavor / increase in acidity over the 4-5 day life of the bottle. I was excited (and dubious) about trying this product ... and I'm thrilled with it! It exceeds all of my expectations: great design, easy to use, excellent results.It's a 3-piece set: one hand-pump suction device and two bottle stoppers (for two bottles of wine; they're good, tight stoppers on their own even without creating a vacuum). Just press a stopper into a wine bottle, position the suction device on top, pull up to suction air out of the bottle, and keep pumping until you feel yourself pulling against the pressure of the vacuum you've created. The vacuum holds until you release it by pressing a little button on the stopper, causing an energetic ""whoosh"" even a full day later. Rinse the device and you're done. I've tried this on two bottles of wine so far and it seems that not until Day 4 can I tell the wine isn't ""just opened."" My only quibble is that the suction device pulls some humidity as well as air from the bottle, creating drips to wipe up (caution: red-wine dribble might stain).

"If you want to enjoy a hot beverage while being very active, this attractive Camelbak Forge is the leakproof (at all angles), vacuum-insulated mug for you, with a loop that's easy to attach to clothing or gear or carry with a single finger.But if you just want a mug/travel-mug to keep your beverage hot while you sip from it over time, be advised that the cap on this one is fussy and frustrating. To take a drink, press and hold a lever to open the drinking port; when released, the port closes to become leakproof again. To drink frequently, slide a button to keep the port open slightly (and I mean slightly; it dispenses a sip, not a swallow). Whenever the port is opened, by either method, a tiny bit of built-up coffee steam first spits out, so vent it away from your face (or shirt, so it doesn't stain). I tested the mug on hot cafÃ© lattes and hot brewed coffee, with the port open continuously or with it open only for sipping, and the beverages stayed hot for, respectively, an hour and two-plus hours.The cap's low-volume sip, annoying spray of coffee steam, and dozens of threads/crevices to clean afterward make it frustrating for casual use. But when I'm out on my bike, those frustrations are somewhat dwarfed by its leakproof portability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NENJHIH38DBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G46CR00#wasThisHelpful","R2NENJHIH38DBM","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent product. The packaging has a child-resistant cap that's fairly easy for an adult to open, and a body that's easy to hold in one hand and squeeze to direct a stream of cleaner all around the toilet bowl including under the rim. The cleaner inside is viscous enough to coat the sides of the bowl instead of all draining right down into the water. The scent is mild but the formula is strong; the clean bowl smells fresh and positively gleams.The cling coating reminds me of those ""disclosing tablets"" from childhood: you chewed them and they left dye wherever you hadn't brushed your teeth well enough, so you'd know to pay closer attention to those areas. This cleaner coats the whole toilet bowl, and you know you've done a thorough cleaning when you've removed every bit of the colored cleaner with your toilet brush.One caveat: in one test, I used the Lysol ""Cling"" formula on half of my toilet bowl and my usual Lysol ""Power"" (non-Cling) formula to the other half. The Power was actually more viscous and had a more noticeable blue tint than the Cling. So do watch the relative prices; while both are great products, I don't see an advantage that would justify a premium price for either over the other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131RYVFK5M0CG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SLFBCE#wasThisHelpful","R131RYVFK5M0CG","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been looking for two things in a neck pillow: support and washability. This pillow and its cover offer both.It's made of a very firm memory foam, providing neck support that I'd characterize as ""stabilizing,"" even ""bracing,"" more so than ""comfortable."" But stabilizing is exactly what my neck sometimes wants; for comfort, I do also have a pellet-filled ""Bucky"" pillow. My only quibble is that I have to be careful to position the pillow just right, otherwise its ""arms"" press a bit against the sides of my neck and feel like they're restricting blood flow to my head!The cover is perfect. It's attractive, of wonderfully soft velour, with a zipper that makes it easy to get on and off the foam form.

"These Depend seat protectors are better in every way to those blue institutional ""chux"" pads -- they're attractive, soft, substantial and not at all noisy. They're also more absorbent, but ""more"" might not actually mean ""enough.""When I tested one by quickly pouring 1/2 cup of water onto it, the water soaked in and spread to the edge of the pad, threatening to spill over. I tried again on another pad, pouring the water slowly that time, and again it soaked in and spread a bit. Both times, when I pressed on the surface, the water rose up out of the pad -- puddling, never gelling, and when I folded up the pads to throw them away, I could still squeeze the water from them. So whatever is on top of the pad is going to get sopping wet, with the potential of spreading beyond the edges. The good news is that the pad's backing is absolutely leak-proof and keeps the surface beneath it completely dry.These pads will absorb very small spills, and will keep the main part of a larger spill from wetting whatever is directly underneath the pad. They'll also work beautifully as a disposable ""towel,"" either when you want a clean surface to sit on or lay something on, or you want to keep a surface clean from dirt, sweat, sunless tanner that's drying, etc. They're likely the best product available but they're not yet perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5ZOKOXRJ83H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFDI2IS#wasThisHelpful","R3U5ZOKOXRJ83H","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"America's Test Kitchen shuffles and gathers its recipes into various collections based on themes, and this one interested me: ""recipes you can prepare on your schedule"" via eight ""make ahead"" strategies.The ~165 recipes for meat, fish, grain and vegetarian entrees  (serving 4, 6, or 8 people) are accompanied by full-color photos of almost every prepared dish (but without nutrition info). They cover the ""expected"" strategies, for example slow-cooker meals; big-batch meals (eat half, freeze half); and casseroles or marinades where the time-consuming prep/assembly is done in advance.But there's also a ""Sunday Cook"" section, where leftover roasts become weeknight soups/fajitas/fried rices/etc. There's a ""Shop Smart"" section, where a dozen ingredients mix and match over three days into three different meals. And there are sections for foods intentionally cooked ahead and then refrigerated, such as poaches/salads served cold or stews/braises that develop flavors while resting before a quick reheat. Throughout, the editors include tips for ingredients, preparation, storage and freezing that overcome the typical problems that otherwise make such dishes scream ""leftovers.""LOL my desire is not so much to ""cook ahead"" as to ""cook less often"" (and plan/shop less often).

"There are books written *for* child readers, and there are books written *about* children but with a wise narrative voice that also appeal to a crossover audience of young-adult and even adult readers (e.g. To Kill a Mockingbird, The Book Thief). This book is definitely for kids (ages 8-12), with an appealing first-person narrator, 11-year-old Naomi Orenstein. (It will likely grate on older readers, especially when the writing gets ""teachy,"" for example: ""Running this fast, I'll be home in a flash, a milli-flash, which is one thousandth of a flash."")HOWEVER. On a light note, the story is full of references to 1960s-`70s pop culture, which children born in this millennium aren't likely to understand. On a dark note, it also touches on bullying, mental depression, child abuse, and death, which may be disturbing and not well-understood by children.It's an accomplished debut novel, perhaps even an important story, and so my recommendation is that parents (or grandparents, etc.) and children read it and talk about it together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SYH7GWEMYG2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385386079#wasThisHelpful","R1SYH7GWEMYG2O","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a plastic, covered butter dish. However, it's OXO's version, meaning it has some tweaks in the design that make it innovative and easier to use. For example, there's the trademark black rubbery material on the bottom to prevent sliding around on the counter or in the butter compartment of the refrigerator door, and at both ends to enable a good grip in the hand or even just the fingertips. The clear cover is easy to lift off but doesn't slide off inadvertently. The white dish has raised markings at 1-tablespoon intervals; there are actually two sets of markings, one along each side, accommodating both ""eastern"" sticks and ""western"" cubes of packaged butter.When I first started using this dish, I thought it was good; I liked it.

"""This never happened.""Don Draper says that all the time on Mad Men, and in fact he says it to a character who's in the midst of a breakdown after an unwed pregnancy. Those script writers are good: although they didn't invent the line, it *is* fiction. It did happen, and the women never forgot.Subtitled, ""The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v. Wade"", this is an excellent exploration of the social and legal intolerance of teenage unwed pregnancy and motherhood in 1950s-`60s USA, plus a compelling collection of oral histories from those birth mothers.There wasn't much contraception and it absolutely wasn't much available (mostly denied to single women, or accompanied by a big dose of judgment, and condoms were behind the pharmacy counter). Even information about contraception was illegal, and sex education was nil. The 1950s was a period of extreme social conformity and violations came with catastrophic fallout. And it was all on the girl (reliable proof of paternity wasn't there yet), who generally hid it with tight girdles in the early months and disappeared for the latter months to group homes (e.g. Florence Crittenton), typically under the guise of an illness or caring for a family member, and then adoption.""They said, 'You can't raise the baby alone.' But no one expects a widow to give up her baby because her husband dies, do they? No. It's punitive.""I've always appreciated Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 for its mandate of equal sports opportunities for women, but until now I didn't realize its provision was broader (""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance""), prohibiting high schools and colleges from expelling pregnant girls and teenage mothers.I marked dozens of passages despite my having lived at the late edge of the time, and shudder at the lifelong burden these women bear.""One of the questions that come up when you go to court and relinquish is they ask you if you have been coerced in any way, and I thought it was the height of hypocrisy. Of course you're coerced. You're coerced by your parents, who said, 'Don't come home again if you plan to keep that child. We're not going to help you.' You're coerced by everyone around you because of the shame and the lack of acceptance by society and your community. You're not acknowledged as a fit mother because you had sex before marriage.

"Bruno Schulz's The Street of Crocodiles is Jonathan Safran Foer's favorite book, and he likens its existence (amid the destruction of most of Schulz's work) to the fourth wall at the ancient temple site that resisted destruction and became the Wailing Wall. Foer had long wanted to ""sculpt"" a new book by redacting words from an existing ""block"" of text, and TREE OF CODES is that, and an homage to Schulz.I went through phases as I read: he's stealing Schulz's story; then: no, he's just using words that are freely available, including in Schulz's work. In the end, it did seem to be Foer's own work, yet with a feeling of the larger original, particularly that so much is a father, mother, family in decline. Most pages are a mere sentence or two, written with the brevity and imagery of poetry. Schulz's work is surreal fantasy and Foer's even more so.

It's the growing worries about safety and medical emergencies; the move to assisted living; the flip in parent/child roles; the purging of possessions; the end-of-life.

"The name of this product (""pestemal"") flummoxed me at first and I didn't know what to do with it. But now I appreciate that it deserves its own noun -- it's not really a towel or a throw, and yet it's both and a dozen things more. I've used it to cover the worn upholstery of a chair while I waited for shipment of a slipcover and now I have it spread across a table in my sunroom.It's large and of very good quality (soft and absorbent; nicely woven pattern). That pattern and the tassels make it look thicker than it is; it's actually about as thin as a flat dish towel (thus great as a tablecloth, no tipping of glassware; but too thin for a picnic on the ground). I actually expect it to prove quite durable. The product description specifies dimensions of 64-in x 39-in x 1-in, but after three trips through the washer and dryer, mine measures 60-in long (not including tassels) x 35-in wide x 1/16-in thick.

"I have a lot of hair but it's very fine and tends to wilt. I've used a Paul Mitchell mousse for years with good results, then for the past year have bumped it up to a gel with great results. But a gel can feel like a lot of ""product,"" so I was interested to see if this volumizing mousse would get me back to a lighter effect.It comes out of the canister as luxuriantly creamy foam, then collapses instantly between my hands to a film that initially seemed to make no difference in the texture of my wet hair. But as I blew it dry, it developed noticeable body. It felt soft and luxurious when I took sections to use with a curling iron. When I brushed it to smooth it into a style, there was a slight drag that felt like ultra-thick hair. Wow! And there's zero flaking. I was so impressed that I bought a little 2-oz travel size of the volumizing shampoo to pair with the mousse, and the two together seemed somehow to lift my hair and make it dry faster.This is the best mousse I've ever used. My only waver is that it *is* a mousse, and doesn't have the staying power of a gel, especially in heat and humidity. But I'm very impressed, and even if I use a gel this summer, I'll look forward to this product again in the fall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJEJGE907NLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMWMMOC#wasThisHelpful","R3NJEJGE907NLB","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My credentials don't add up to ""audiophile"" -- I just want to connect my iPhone wirelessly to a speaker and listen (without earphones) to music, podcasts and audiobooks. This Sharp system accomplishes that using Bluetooth technology.It's a sleek, nice-looking system with two speakers laid out horizontally (overall: 17.5-in wide, 6-in tall, 6-in deep). That width makes it very stable side-to-side; but it's narrow front-to-back, with even narrower little feet-strips that make the unit prone to rolling. It operates on AC only (not batteries). When turned on, the speakers each move outward a couple of inches, revealing center panels of decorative blue light that respond to the system's functions; the light is dimmable and some (but not all) of the light features can be disabled (as I chose to do). It was easy to pair with my iPhone 4S, and (unlike other Bluetooth speakers I've tried) the connection has never failed. There is also an audio jack and a USB port to play/charge other audio devices (my 6th-generation iPod Nano worked fine).Functions are accessible via a tiny wireless remote that has very good range but less-good sensitivity (it needs to be pointed directly at the speakers, the buttons pressed very deliberately and often more than once). Sound quality is good. Bass/treble is good, easily adjustable via the remote over a decent range. The volume is unimpressive; even with my iPhone and the speaker system both set at max volume, it's not as loud as I sometimes want ... which means it's way too quiet for most people.In summary: this Sharp speaker is attractive, easy to use and meets my basic audio needs. But audiophiles will want to look elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZDAN57IYBXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JD4T4CY#wasThisHelpful","R1QZDAN57IYBXC","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pen is a combination of four colored inks (with fine-point writing tips) plus a mechanical pencil and eraser.As with ink-jet printers, I'll likely run through some ink colors faster than others, but they're apparently refillable (I couldn't locate refills but maybe it's because the product is new?) and the pen's casing seems durable for refillable use. It's an attractive, good-quality pen.

"I've used Paul Mitchell Soft Spray for a decade, it's the only hair spray with a fragrance light enough (essentially: none) to please me. And I've used pump-action sprays instead of aerosols for longer than that because chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants were environmental hazards. But now there are new propellants and I was interested to try this product.Pros: I like it. It's light in scent (again, essentially no lingering fragrance), and although there's a ""crispness"" to my hair immediately after use, that softens while still maintaining good hold all day. I wash my hair every other day, and a huge plus to this product is that my hair continues to smell fresh on Day 2 (vs. my previous spray).Cons: It's expensive. And I remain conflicted about the aerosol aspect. On the one hand, I'd forgotten how much I like an aerosol -- the spray is so fast and sheer. On the other hand, this product's label lists a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) propellant, which is better than a CFC but not without risk (it doesn't destroy the ozone layer but does increase greenhouse gases). And, unlike a pump spray, the pressurized metallic canister is not refillable. I'll use the product until it's gone and update this review with final impressions about cost and quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26OBAX5PXXL0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMWMMOW#wasThisHelpful","R26OBAX5PXXL0R","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've embarked on some WWI reading during this year that begins the centennial commemoration of The War to End All Wars. So far, it's been enlightening and satisfying (for example: fiction such as All Quiet on the Western Front; nonfiction like The Proud Tower and The Last of the Doughboys; and tangential nonfiction like The Great Influenza). But it also feels overwhelming and sort of scattershot, and I began to want to map a loose plan for my reading -- areas of interest where I want to delve deeper, and especially areas of my ignorance where I want to learn the basics.I discovered this book at about that time, and although I've been neutral-to-negative about other Dummies volumes, I decided to see if this one would at least give me an overview that could direct my reading elsewhere. It's given me so much more than that!My complaints about the Dummies series go back some years: 1) the numbing repetition (with little actual content) and 2) the silly (disruptive) tone. Regarding the first, this book is organized like others in the series, so there is that necessary redundancy (see? I didn't sense it as repetition) between the overview sections and the detail sections. And regarding the second, there's silliness here only in the headings that break up the text. The narrative itself completely respects the reader and the topic; it's light and conversational (engaging, never boring) and the flow isn't interrupted by inane asides. Written by a British historian, there's a LOT of content -- the world before, during and after the war, through international lenses of politics, military, technology and society/culture. It's much more a complete treatment than the overview I expected. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CRVURZ233R3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118679997#wasThisHelpful","R1CRVURZ233R3P","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use both manual and powered toothbrushes because they seem to get at my teeth in slightly different ways, plus a powered brush is a fun change. I still love the Oral B I bought 15+ years ago, but it uses rechargeable batteries and they no longer hold a good charge. So I've been eyeing other toothbrushes like the Spinbrush and was excited to try this one.Pros: I like that it uses regular batteries (2 AA); they're more convenient than needing to keep the rechargables charged. The unit is easy to hold and it's easy to remove the brush head for thorough rinsing.Cons: The motor is louder than the Oral B; the brush head seems to buzz more than actually move (I get less of a fresh feel after brushing); and the brush head is HUGE (not just the bristles but also the frame; very difficult to get around the back of my upper molars).

"This is an excellent anatomical atlas of the human body, lushly visualized through large, full-color medical illustrations (not photographs). It's organized by 11 functional systems (e.g. skeletal, muscular, cardiovascular, reproductive), each section beginning with a system overview and then delving deeper -- in Dorling Kindersley (DK) style, meaning mostly images and minimal text. That said (""functional systems""), keep in mind that this is a book on *anatomy* (structure), not *physiology* (function), and that it's geared to a lay or student audience.I have a special interest in the digestive system so I turned to that section first, and was discouraged that the first page I read defined the appendix as a ""dead-end tube attached to the last part of the large intestine, with no function in modern humans."" Actually, it's attached to the *first* part of the large intestine, and its function is *unknown* but thought to be involved in the immune system. Both of those errors are corrected on a subsequent page, but that put me on high alert for other errors; I'm happy to report that I didn't find more.An Index and a significant Glossary complete the book. The illustrations are never morbid; rather, they inspire profound awe at how fabulously everything comes together.*NOTE for readers who have other anatomy books and don't want to duplicate: the cover and copyright pages note that this book's content was previously published in ""The Complete Human Body.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQEGTOAO38697/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465419543#wasThisHelpful","RQEGTOAO38697","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I subscribed to Cook's Illustrated magazine, I read each issue cover to cover, enjoying every bit of deconstructing a recipe or technique and evaluating commercial pantry staples and cookery tools. And now I devoured every word of this big volume on the science behind 50 fundamental concepts essential to good cooking.Each concept is presented as an 8-16 page chapter that begins with the science/theory behind a technique, followed by a cooking experiment that tests the science, and then much further exploration of the concept via at least half-a-dozen recipes (for generally familiar, delicious, foods). Note: this is not an ""illustrated,"" coffee-table book; there are some graphics to help describe the science, and some simple photos of experimental results, but this is a text-heavy book -- lush with information not visuals.The topics mostly concern meat, eggs, vegetables and baking. All of it feels solid -- the reinforcement of concepts I already know about, the confidence to try techniques that are new to me, and many ""aha"" moments about the whys behind the science, some of which come to mind even now:* when to cut a food with the grain vs. against the grain (answer: onions and tough meats, respectively; cutting across cells breaks them, resulting in a too-pungent onion but a more tender meat);* the difference between baking soda (which reacts with an acid in the recipe to create CO2 bubbles that leaven) vs. baking powder (which contains baking soda + a powdered acid) vs. double-acting baking powder (which contains a second acid that works later, in the oven's heat) -- and why you ever even need separate baking soda (it leads to flavorful browning);* why adding eggs to a batter one at a time, and alternating the addition of wet and dry ingredients, does matter (both cause ingredients to incorporate faster/better and prevent the over-mixing that toughens the batter);* whether to salt scrambled eggs before or after cooking (before: ""Salt affects the electrical charge on the protein molecules in the eggs, reducing the tendency of the proteins to bond with each other. A weaker protein network means eggs are less likely to overcoagulate and will cook up tender, not tough."")If you have an opinion about Cook's Illustrated magazine, that will be your opinion of this book -- multiplied by 50 :) If you're unfamiliar with the magazine, I highly recommend using Amazon's ""Look Inside"" feature to browse the Table of Contents for the concepts/techniques covered, and then read the ""First Pages"" (which is ""Concept 1: Gentle Heat Prevents Overcooking"" and is representative of the book).Enthusiastically recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZR7HTLMOQIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933615982#wasThisHelpful","R1YZR7HTLMOQIX","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On paper and in the hand, this product seems terrific. In use, it's okay: it does soften the bright sunlight, but it's clumsy.It's a ~17-in square roller shade made of black plastic-ish mesh, housed in a plastic tube. It mounts on a side car window via your choice of suction cups (included) directly onto the glass or hanging from hooks (included) placed over the top edge of the window. To use, you pull the shade down by hand to the desired length and secure it to the window there with an additional suction cup. When not in use, you can leave it down, or you can retract the shade into the housing by pushing the auto-rollup button and then either leave it in place at the top of the window or pull it off until the next use.In use, the pull-down/roll-up aspect works very well. (*I definitely advise caution/supervision with the auto roll-up because it really snaps up the shade fast and will bump anything in the way.*) In use, the mounting features work less well. I'm in Chicago, and the suction cups didn't adhere to the window for more than literally a second until just now when the air (and the window) have some warmth to them. So instead, I use the clips to mount the housing over the top of the window. But they're a little too thick for the window to close easily and fully, and I fear that forcing it will eventually damage the window seal or mis-align the window track or stress the power motor. So that means the window stays open a tiny bit, which is disappointing. Plus, because the suction cup at the bottom of the shade doesn't adhere to the cold window, the shade hangs loose and flaps around every time I speed up/slow down/change direction. That's a dealbreaker during the cold months.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DGQ9NBZV0KL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3X7ZT6#wasThisHelpful","R1DGQ9NBZV0KL4","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been happily using the MarBlue Vassen cover on my Kindle Paperwhite at home, but have been hesitant to travel with it because its velour-ish interior seems like it would be difficult to clean after use with dirty hands or in rustic environments. So I was interested to see this cover, and thrilled to verify that its plastic-coated canvas exterior and neoprene-ish interior can be easily and thoroughly cleaned. It's exactly what I was looking for.Like many other covers, this one has four corner elastic bands that hold the Kindle extremely securely, a front cover that folds back for one-handed holding, and a supple elastic band along the side edge to hold the cover closed (or open). This unit also has a slide pocket on the inside front cover; I wasn't sure what I'd use it for until the moment I loaded my Kindle and picked it up, and my index finger slid right into the pocket and made holding the device effortless. The stitching is perfect, and other than having a slightly higher price and not having an auto-wake feature, this cover has all advantages and no disadvantages; my only quibble is that the ""Jonathan Adler"" logo on the inside could be more discreet or attractive.My cover is in the ""Bargello Waves"" pattern and I may order another in the ""Turquoise Mandala.""

"I'm an organized packer (think Jack Nicholson in ""As Good as It Gets"") and these packing cubes are fabulous. I've used these 3-piece sets for two years in three colors (aqua, denim and red paisley), plus the Shoe Bag and the pair of Shoe Sleeves. The top three benefits: 1) they organize clothing (by whole outfits or by types of clothing, e.g. shirts or pants vs underwear/socks); 2) they ""contain"" the clothing, keeping things folded neatly instead of wrinkled from sloshing around loose in the suitcase; 3) the different colors can visually differentiate whose clothing it is.I use them on every trip and usually live out of the suitcase. But I just returned from a cruise, where you really have no choice but to unpack and use the stateroom drawers, and these cubes were even better there: unpacking took about 5 minutes (I just transferred the cubes from the suitcase to the drawers); the cubes kept everything neat in the drawers; and the cubes provided a hygienic layer against direct contact between my clothes and the public drawer.After each trip, I simply wash them with the rest of the laundry, air them dry, and they're ready for the next trip.

"Soon after I'd enjoyed Waldman's 2009 essay collection, Bad Mother, I heard an interview where she characterized her writing philosophy not exactly as ""write what you know"" but ""write what you *want* to know."" Walking the talk, she then described the genesis of her next writing project: she'd Googled keywords of topics that interested her: ""Hungary"" (she wanted to visit a friend there and liked the excuse of researching a writing project) + ""the Holocaust"" (she's Jewish and hadn't written about it) + ""art"" (she was interested) = ""a novel about the Hungarian Gold Train at the end of WWII."" I was thrilled to learn that she's seen her idea through to publication here.""[On the train were] 1,500 cases of watches, jewelry, and silver, 5,250 carpets, thousands of coats and stoles and muffs of mink, fox, and ermine, crates of microscopes and cameras, porcelain and glassware, furniture, books and manuscripts and tapestries, gold coins and bullion, the few remaining precious gems, the liturgical objects, the stamp collections and silver-backed hairbrushes, all the items, valuable and less so, that constituted the wealth of the Jews of Hungary, 437,402 of whom had been deported to Auschwitz over the course of just 56 days almost exactly a year before.""A bit like Nicole Krauss's Great House, this novel is written as a series of novellas linked by a shared item, in this case a jeweled pendant. In the first, the pendant is discovered by an American army officer charged with securing the contents of the Gold Train in 1945 Salzburg amid displaced persons and the aftermath of war. In the second, that officer's grand-daughter works with a gray-market art dealer in 2013 Budapest to trace ownership of the pendant. And finally, that owner and her life are explored in 1913 Budapest.I had a couple false starts with this novel; the first section felt wooden and I feared that Waldman's ""Googled"" premise wasn't going to work. But near the end of that section, she captured me and I felt a story begin and then get better and better. She writes well, the material is always intellectually interesting (the aftermath of war, especially regarding Hungarian Jews; art history; feminism and suffrage), and eventually it also becomes emotionally engaging. And enjoyable! -- in the second section there's a nod to a fairy tale that's a blatant chuckle between writer and reader, and the third section, narrated by a Freudian analyst, has much amusing satire. And the story is important: in the end, it's clear that the value of the stolen contents of the Gold Train is insignificant compared with the exterminated human potential.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO0DL5UWH4V7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385533543#wasThisHelpful","RO0DL5UWH4V7J","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the one hand, this book is, itself, as â€œnice {a} little placeâ€ to spend some time as the title promises of a day at Chicagoâ€™s Wrigley Field. George Will, a Cub fan from age 7, compiles an altogether pleasant -- funny, optimistic, smart -- collection of stories and statistics about the history of baseball, its players and its playing fields.I recommend it ... as long as you go in knowing what is my â€œon the other handâ€: that much of the content is about baseball in general, not the Cubs or Wrigley Field specifically. Also on the other hand, is a wholly frustrating lack of organization to the bookâ€™s content -- the narrative jumps all over the place in time and topic. Still, over the 200 pages, a bit of Cubs/Wrigley history does accumulate. I especially appreciated the look at the business side of baseball and attendance; the lack of standardized field specifications and how teams use their fields to their advantages; and how antiquated Wrigley has become in light of the amenities that fans (and players) expect at a ballpark (its newest owners are beginning to remedy that).In the end, I was disappointed that this is not a satisfying history of Wrigley Field ... and I was entertained and informed by what it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T76UHW99QFH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385349319#wasThisHelpful","R1T76UHW99QFH5","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We had our sump pump replaced on a muddy day and I had the opportunity to try out these wipes on the clean-up of the basement floor and stairs afterward.They're smaller than I'd expected but still a decent size (approximately 9x9-in square), and drier than I'd expected (but easily remedied with a little water). They're saturated with a cleaner, and the chemical scent is light (maybe because it had dried out a bit) and didn't linger too long after use. They're impressively strong -- a textured surface that scrubs well and a thick, toughly woven material that never tore or shredded even in use on my concrete basement floor -- and cleaned impressively well.My only negatives are one quibble (that they could be better perf-ed to tear more easily; I needed to use two hands and some strength), and one potential deal-breaker for future purchases (that they're manufactured in China, where unlabeled ingredients seem to pop into products; I was careful to wear gloves but that doesn't protect against something that may be airborne). I'll definitely use them on my outdoor furniture come spring.Other than feeling wary about the China aspect, I'd recommend these for tough and/or long cleaning jobs. They're more a disposable cloth than a wipe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30BLOVIELRQSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HBBX4EA#wasThisHelpful","R30BLOVIELRQSG","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was excited to see this book since I've enjoyed several others about cartooning and/or The New Yorker magazine (see some recommendations at the end of this review*). Here, Mankoff (cartoon editor at The New Yorker) writes a little about his life; a little about the history of magazine cartoons; about work at The New Yorker; about launching The Cartoon Bank of cartoon art.And he writes a lot about cartooning (he calls cartoons ""drawn jokes"") and cartoonists, including the basics of humor and where creativity comes from. For example, there are ""word firsters"" vs ""doodle firsters"" (cartoonists whose ideas come from, respectively, words or images), and there are cartoonists who riff off those who came before (the so-called collective cartoon conscious) and those who are inspired by real life (e.g. Roz Chast).The book's title comes from Mankoff's best-known cartoon, the caption of which has become a cultural aphorism. His best line in the book has also become an aphorism to memoir fans like me: ""[Y]ou can't spell memoir without the *moi*"" (though he does veer away from himself often enough that I think the *moi* here is almost as much cartoonists in general as him specifically). He sprinkles hundreds of cartoons throughout the text to illustrate and entertain, and I enjoyed every page of it ... which is satisfyingly long at ~300 pages and I would have read 1000 more.* If you liked any of the following, you'll love Mankoff's book (and vice versa):The Naked Cartoonist -- Mankoff's previous book on cartooning and creativity;The Rejection Collection and Blown Covers -- about cartoons and artwork that *didn't* make the cut into The New Yorker;On the Money -- more serious: cartoons that reflect nearly a century of commentary on social economics; andMy Mistake -- Daniel Menaker's recent memoir that includes his decades as editor at The New Yorker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12T72YDHRJEMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080509590X#wasThisHelpful","R12T72YDHRJEMK","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This package contains three triple-blade razors plus one trimmer-cap -- essentially a tiny comb that snaps onto the head of the razor and lifts hair so that the razor can cut it.The razor itself works very well, shaves closely and without razor burn or bumps later. While I always nick myself during the first use of any disposable razor, I did not with this one -- maybe it's the blades or the angle of the head or how the handle is shaped to be held -- and that was great.As for trimming, I've been using a Schick Quattro TrimStyle, which has a razor at one end and a battery-powered trimmer at the other, and it trims very well. But I wouldn't mind doing without a battery gadget so I was interested in this Bic. Unfortunately, the Bic functioned more as a ""thinner"" than a trimmer -- after going over the area numerous times at different angles, the hair was definitely sparser but what remained was as long as before using the trimmer, and there was no way to customize the length to individual preference. I'll stay with the Schick for trimming.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28CP02GAZ36CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D18ZDM8#wasThisHelpful","R28CP02GAZ36CV","A3QOIDA6B2NIPO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QOIDA6B2NIPO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The color is actually a little lighter than it is here on screen but that doesn't detract from the quality of this jacket. The sherpa lining is all the way through, even through to the hood, so I know he's going to be warm. Once zipped up and the hood is on it really protects his head.

Not only does it look great aesthetically wise but it has kept the air in my room nice and moist.

"I've always loved the skeleton style watches and this is certainly no exception. I also own a few other Lucien Piccard watches and they have all stood the test of time. This is truly a beauty and it feels really solid, not like the cheap watches you might buy at the mall counters. I do have to say that the retail price is kinda stretching it a bit but I would certainly pay the price that Amazon lists it for with no problem. Makes a great Christmas gift, birthday gift or even think Father's Day. Presentation is truly there in a nice gift box. You really only need a bag.We didn't have problems adjusting the watch as most people seemed to have but I did take off a start because the ""leather"" band while it may be leather doesn't seem like it will hold up over time.

"As huge Assassin's Creed fans we just had to have this cane sword. After all the boys were Assassin's Creed characters for Halloween and we're currently playing Syndicate as I type this. Now first of all you must remember that this is a TOY. It's not a real cane sword but a replicate and a nice looking one too. It's made entirely of plastic but it's pretty sturdy. The hidden blade in the handle is a nice touch but we had a bit of problem with the one at the end of the cane coming out without you ""activating"" it.This would make a great prop if you have the costume for Halloween or even Cosplay and even would be great if you're a collector of the Assassin's Creed memorabilia. The boys love it and so does my husband who put it together. Came in three pieces and was totally easy to put together even without the piece of paper instruction that came with it.I took off a star because I wish the construction was a little better allowing you to use it as a real cane or that we didn't have that defective hidden blade problem.

"I've always wanted a dehydrator and I've had this for quite some time to really write my review. First let me say that this does come in a big box but it's not as heavy as you would think. I haven't yet used it to dehydrate meats so I can't really write about my experience on that but I have done quite a few fruits and I'll have to say that you'll NEVER buy dried fruits again. I have done bananas, apples, strawberries and even did mangoes and all came out really good!Now I gave this 4 stars because the manual is almost laughable. If they had a manual that you could really understand and was easy to use then this would have been a 5 star product. You basically have to figure out how to use this on your own but once you've got it down you're good to go. There is no assembly needed which is great so that's a plus!I have a lot of counter space in my kitchen but I can say that it takes up as about as much space as a microwave. They trays holds quite a bit of product so this is perfect for families. I have kids who loves dried fruit and we've been having a lot of fun using it thus far.

"Over the course of having several children, I have become pickier and pickier about my car seats. The Maxi-Cosi Vello 65 Convertible Car Seat meets several of my car seat standards. The first thing I loved about the car seat was when I took it out of the box, it had some weight to it. Thatâ€™s always a positive in my book. I donâ€™t want to stick my child in a flimsy, light weight car seat. The total weight of this car seat is 23 pounds.I loved the color of the car seat. The one we received was black. If you touch the material on the car seat itâ€™s very soft, almost like a cozy blanket.Here are a few of the best features of the car seat.·  The headrest is super easy to adjust, which I love. I can pull the red tab up or down to make it fit my child the way it needs to.Â·  The straps are super easy to move up and down.Â·  The straps tighten and loosen with the pull of a strap or push of a button.Â·  The car seat also goes from 9 pounds all the way to 64 pounds.There arenâ€™t many cons to this car seat, but I did see a few.Â·  Itâ€™s not super easy to install. I struggled to make it extremely tight in our vehicle. I feel like itâ€™s a little complicated for a parent to install. I actually plan on taking mine to the fire station to make sure itâ€™s properly installed.Â·  I did not like how the buckle has to be adjusted at the bottom (where their bottom sits). You have to take it out of the slot to adjust it. Not really ideal.Overall this is an excellent car seat. Comfortable, safety tested, stylish, and can last an incredibly long time. Also, itâ€™s forward facing and rear facing, which is always a plus in my book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WSGF5D7MA30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU9CKTG#wasThisHelpful","R1WSGF5D7MA30","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the Invicta brand and own two of their female version. With hubby's birthday coming up I decided to get him this one. It comes in a big bright yellow package (reminds me of Big Bird) and for a moment I thought, why this cheap packaging. However on the inside is a nicer package with your watch enfolded in it. The watch is heavy, not your regular cheap $20 watch but $595 is a bit of a stretch because personally I don't think this watch is worth maybe more than $200, but who am I to judge, I'm no watch maker. It's a beautiful watch and it looks just like the photo on Amazon. Haven't had a chance to test out the water resistant function but my old Invictas have held up so I'm sure this one will too.My husband is a big guy, 6' 5"" and 220lbs and with big wrists.

"I have to say that this compact baby swing is just that, compact. Not like the big ones that you usually see. Assembly is also pretty simple and straight forward. I like the fact that its  a 2 in 1, both a glider and a bouncer so you're generally saving yourself a bit of money. The glider according to Graco is for babies up to 30lbs and the bouncer for babies up to 20lbs. It does come with a newborn baby support insert so it's great for your newborns and you'll be able to give mom a break while baby gently glides or bounces so you can get things done around the house. It's not loud and obnoxious but the toys could have been a bit prettier in my opinion.Another feature that I've been loving since they've introduced it is the battery/AC option. Now you can take this to any room in the house as long as you have an outlet there and if you don't then you have the option of using a battery. The seats are plush and nice so I know your little one would be comfortable in it.Now I gave this 4 stars because there were a few things I didn't like. For 1, the toys don't do much. They just sit there so they're basically useless. The swing itself doesn't seem to swing very well the heavier the baby is but I guess that's to be expected but even at just 15lbs, it was a hit or miss.

"OK so I might be a bit prejudiced but I've always been a fan of Turtle Beach and it's what I own and use with all my gaming systems. Now I like giving others a try and having boys who destroy headsets I personally don't buy Turtle Beach for them but get them cheaper versions. This I got for my 14yr old who games more than he reads.I decided to test this headset out for myself while doing the Gears of War beta. Now if you're a big fan of FPS then you know why games prefer the Turtle Beach headsets. With a TB you feel like you're right there in the game. Sounds is amazing and you can't beat that. These on the other hand, the sound wasn't spectacular but at this price I wasn't really expecting them to be. The set up was easy enough and I was able to wear them for about an hour before they started to feel irritating around my ears. TBH that's a problem I have with most headsets anyway because of the bulkiness. They do feel comfortable once you put them on and the padding is enough to not make my ear hurt on instant contact.Now I did have a bit of problem with the mic. It seems like I had to shout a little louder for my teammates to hear me. Not something I want to be doing in the middle of the night. I seem to be hearing them ok but they couldn't hear me well. Besides that small issue these would have been a great headset. Maybe they could get that sorted out.Now if you have kids and don't want to spend the money for a Turtle Beach then this is a safe bet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R253CC14DRG5WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XO041RQ#wasThisHelpful","R253CC14DRG5WQ","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I got this I owned the Yale Security YRD240-NR-619 which is the keyless touchscreen version and I loved it. I've had no issues with it but my home currently has 3 entry ways and I wanted something that I felt would keep me safe. When given the chance to test this one out I jumped at it because I was actually looking into getting one on my own. I loved my first Yale and wanted to keep my love going. This one isn't touchscreen but great for the entry way I was going to use it for.One thing I should mention is that installation and set up for these are actually pretty easy. You would think that since it seems so complicated it would be but they're not. I was able to install mine in less than 10 minutes. One of the feature that I just love is the illuminated keypad. While it's not a glowing light, it's bright enough for you to see without having to peer really closely. Perfect for those late nights from the club when you're not quite yourself.It does come with 4 batteries already included (thank you Yale) and from using my other one I would say that battery life is long lasting. So far I've had no issues with my old one batteries going low and I've had it for quite some time now. So far I have programmed it with 3 codes. One for me, one for my kids and another for my mother-in-law who's visiting. Once she leaves that code will be deleted. It's another safety feature that I love about these locks. Set the code for maintenance crew coming in to your home etc, and delete once they leave. Better than leaving a key laying out that they can copy.If you're big on home security and don't want to invest in a home security system, this is by far one of the better locks that you can buy. Thieves would have a hard time trying to break in and you'll feel secure knowing that you can change codes as often as you want. No more need to change locks and get new keys.

"This is your very basic musical mobile. For the price it isn't bad. It's pretty easy to install on your crib and love the fact that the toys are removable. However in this day and age it's the norm for parents to want something such as a remote. You know, you don't want to actually go in the room and put the mobile on if you can avoid waking up baby. This unfortunately is not the case. The music plays for about 20 minutes so when it ends you have to go and turn it back on. Volume is either low/high but not too loud to be annoying.

"I recently got this to replace an HTC that was broken on the Cricket network. I was at first amazed at the price and the fact that it doesn't really say much about the phone in the description. Set up was super easy once we got it and we were pleasantly surprised at the cameras. While it's not as great as my Galaxy S6, it's still a great camera. As a matter of fact the front facing camera actually took better photos than my Galaxy S6. There's not a lot of apps downloaded on the phone but you can always delete what you don't want.It came with some really nice headsets and it has an FM radio to boot. Not much phones come with FM radios these days. My last one was a Nokia many years ago. The only con and I'm sure there might be a way to do is, is the talk to text feature that I just love on my Galaxy. I couldn't figure out for the life of me how to get it, or maybe it's just non-existent.The battery life seems to work as any typical phone. While I don't talk much I do spend a lot of time surfing the web and texting and so far I've been able to go for about 8hrs with still about 40% of battery life left. For an unlocked phone this is a great price and I wouldn't hesitate to get another if needed. This may be cheap but it certainly doesn't look or feel that way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELJ4LIF3IXVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129T0XXS#wasThisHelpful","RELJ4LIF3IXVM","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased one of the Classic Doodle with Stamps for my pre-schooler and it was a total waste of money. It lasted about 1 week before the erase board was totally unusable if that long. When you spend money on a toy you want that toy to last for as long as it can and 1 week doesn't cut it for me. I threw it in the trash and we decided to just practice using crayon/pencil/pen and paper. When I saw this one from VTech I decided to give it another try. After all this one had a carrying handle and can be taken on our road trips which we just love to take. All pieces were intact and it does come with 2AA trial batteries. I decided to leave the batteries in because they worked. If you have a pre-schooler you know how tough they can be on toys. So far she had written so roughly on the pad that it leaves the indentation on it but I was still able to erase it and it looks so much better than the Classic Doodle.The stamps are an added touch and she has been happily stamping away to her contentment. I love the fact that the pen is attached and also the voice is clear enough for her to follow the instructions. She has been having a blast and this is now one of her go to toy. Now I didn't give it 5 stars because the writing pad is slowly losing it's life. I just wish there was a way for toy makers to make this last a little longer, at least it lasted more than a week!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ELNA0YMPM0OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUZH4LK#wasThisHelpful","R3ELNA0YMPM0OY","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have the Woodland Friends line then I would suggest getting this to complete your collection. If you don't then I would say give this one a skip. While it is easy to set up, all you need is a Philips screwdriver and a D battery, you may want to rethink if you have a baby older than say 3 months old. This is perfect for newborns with a very light vibration and the toys are bright enough for your baby to look at. Reaching them on the other hand may not be an easy feat. The cover is removable so it's hygienic, after all you don't want your baby sitting in a dirty seat.If you're looking for music then there is none, just vibrations. This is very basic and I think you can do a lot better for the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CGKEGN6T8FJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STTR0UM#wasThisHelpful","R3CGKEGN6T8FJ3","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have a baby/toddler still in diapers and you're looking for a great diaper pail, I think this is the one that you should be thinking of getting. While most diaper pails are made of plastic, I love the fact that this one is made of steel which means that it will last a lot longer than usual. I've noticed that it does keep the smell in but beware once you open it, you will surely smell it. That's expected of course though since after all it's meant to keep the smell in. I love the toddler safety lock which is great for those who have kids who love to open things. Another of the plus is that you don't need any special bags. Unlike those where you have to buy replacement bags which ends up costing you an arm and a leg this one doesn't. Setting it up was pretty easy and emptying was also pretty easy too. You'll definitely love this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5GKGLZ4R6W1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00821FLT4#wasThisHelpful","R5GKGLZ4R6W1G","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've always been a big fan of Dr. Martens and my oldest daughter own a few pairs so when I saw the toddler version I just had to pick them up for my 3 year old.

"My daughter recently got decided that Monster High was the next best thing so when I got the chance to give this a try we couldn't say no. This is big and it however does come in a box that you can wrap so have no fear that the receiver will see what's inside. Although it's recommended for ages 6-12 it can be used for those a little younger with supervision. This is 3 stories tall so there is lots to do and your little one will have fun playing for quite a few hours. Just let her imagination take flight. With movable parts it is truly a lot of fun.It did take a little time to put together because the parts although labeled was a little confusing.

"I love Fisher Price Swings and would probably not get any other when shopping for baby gifts etc. This however is one that I might pass on if shopping. While this is easy to set up as most FP swings are and is considered deluxe, it's not quite as plush as most of their other deluxe swings. I love the plush comfort and this certainly isn't. It is however removable and machine washable so makes it easy to clean. It does come with 2 different swinging motions (front to back & side by side) and even with the smart swing technology that gives you 6 different swing speeds, I noticed that the baby who weighed about 15lbs, didn't swing quite as well as in an older FP swing we had. It comes with 16 songs but the sound wasn't that great either. The owls overhead is a cute factor but doesn't do anything, your baby just looks at them but I did love that their is a mirror overhead since babies love looking at themselves. Another thing I loved was the tray that included beads that will give older babies something to play with. It has 2 power option, battery and AC Outlet so you can save money on batteries if you prefer which I do.Bottom line, while I love the bright colors, I personally wouldn't pay this much for the Woodland Friends swing. Not as soft and plush and the swing technology didn't perform as well as the more expensive models. I give this one 3 1/2 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8E2GGD55TED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8VPWNC#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8E2GGD55TED","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though I have boys my daughter is as big a Thomas fan as any of them, maybe even bigger. When given the chance to get this to review she couldn't wait to open the box, and boy what a big box it was. It is HUGE! Since this comes in it's own packaging it might be a bit difficult to conceal if you're buying as a gift. As soon as she saw it she made her dad open and put it together. Set up wasn't too difficult but since we have carpeted floors it wasn't too much fun at first. I bought a play mat and placed it on there and boy what fun she had. I love the fact that this doesn't come with motorized trains so it makes it a lot more fun for her pushing the trains around the tracks. Going under the bridges and even rolling up to the station.

"I'm usually a fan of Amazon jewelry but this one is a definite pass. Personally I would not pay close to $100 for this, maybe $40/$50 max. It's 10k and truly looks better online than it does in person. See all the fancy gift boxes that Amazon shows you? First it does not come in anything quite so fancy but a regular plain blue box and the earrings in a little ziploc bag. Not gifting quality at all. The earrings are pretty light but I don't like anything weighing me down so that's a plus. They are pretty sturdy but the hooks are flimsy and really sharp going in your ears, so be careful putting them in. While I personally wouldn't give these to an adult my teenage daughter seemed to like them and they're a better fit for the younger kids. Maybe as a graduation gift perhaps.I give these about a 3 1/2 stars not quite 4 because of the packaging, size and the overall quality of these.

"If youâ€™ve ever put a baby item together and were annoyed with the process, youâ€™ll love this basic kidâ€™s toy. Literally 4 snaps and youâ€™re done putting it together. Would I pay $25 for this toy? Probably not. The quality of the item is good, but still feels like itâ€™s cheaply made. Thereâ€™s nothing incredibly special about this toy that would warrant such an expensive price. The toy is lightweight and easy to move around. The batteries do not come with the toy.The activities on the Fisher-Price Animal Friends Learning Table are pretty age appropriate. Iâ€™d worry that a child would become bored with it pretty quickly though. Overall, a good toy, but the price is a little too much for something so basic.

Besides that it is pretty good. I'm surprised that they said that there was a hint of chili pepper because I personally couldn't taste it. You'd have to add a bit more peppers if you're looking for a spicier taste. I was able to make a bit of Thai-style curry chicken and I have to say that it came out pretty good.

"There are a lot of places where you can get cloud storage for free or cheap, which is great and has its uses, but there are also a lot of reasons for having a local backup and storage solution. If you have a data cap or a slow connection, nothing beats a portable hard drive.

It supports the latest USB 3.0 standard for fast transfers of up to 5 GB/s and lets you set up password protection for solid security if your drive is ever lost or stolen. Data is encrypted with a hardware based, 256-bit encryption solution that is very secure if a proper password is used.If you arenâ€™t a Mac user, have no fear because itâ€™s easy enough to plug the drive in and reformat it for Windows with just a few clicks of the mouse. All the same security and convenience features are available with the included software package.As is typical with Western Digital products, you get a solid feeling, well made and attractive piece of hardware available in several colors. The My Passport has a compact footprint of a little over 3 ¼â€ by 4 Â¼â€ by Â¾â€ thick.

"When you have a newborn, you will do anything to protect them. Theyâ€™re so fragile and everything is about them. The Britax B-Safe 35 Elite Infant Car Seat is one of those car seats that you want on your side. Everything about is screams safety. They didnâ€™t just slap something together to try and sell it, they carefully put every detail in to ensure your baby is comfortable and safe.It was a very simple installation and also every easy to do. One thing I hate about infant car seats is that they tend to take up a lot of room and that's pretty standard with this one. I love the click and go feature that allows you to connect it to a Britax stroller but I don't own one at this time but it's good to know that it can be used.I have to admit that the easily adjustable straps are also a nice perk of the carseat. I love the no-rethread harness which makes it super easy to adjust and keep your little one secure in his/her seat. The frame is incredibly sturdy and thatâ€™s what matters when it comes time to utilize the carseat. I also love that this carseat goes up to 35 pounds. So many people switch their babies over too soon because the weight on a normal infant carseat can only hold 22 pounds.Britax B-Safe 35 Elite Infant Car Seat puts safety and quality first but also manages to create this insanely stylish carseat, which amazes me.

"I just bought a house and the one thing that was highly recommended and one that I would recommend to anyone getting a new home, or even a rental, is to get a new lock. Since this is my home which includes children I wanted a lock that would keep us safe. We have a security system and I live in a cul-de-sac in a very safe community but you can never be too safe. When you have kids one thing that you worry about as well is the fact that they're going to lose their keys and someone is going to find it. So when I discovered this Yale Security lock I just had to have it.Installation was a breeze and took me about 20 minutes. It comes with 4AA batteries but I also love the fact that it uses a 9V battery back up in the case of anything remotely happening. I can't say how long the AA batteries will last because I haven't had it that long but so far so good.One the features that really sold me on this is the fact that I can give each child a separate code, so my 10yr old who is autistic was able to choose a code that he would remember fairly easily. I can also give the babysitter or the dogsitter a separate code just for the night. No need to pass out keys because there isn't any so I don't have to worry about someone making a copy of my house keys. That was what really sold me on this. It has been easy to use and we just love it and now wonder why we never thought of getting one before. I now recommend it to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UC4ZRAGJ65KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPP33LW#wasThisHelpful","R1UC4ZRAGJ65KG","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As a blogger I work with quite a few companies and I have to know when to schedule out their reviews.

There are tabs for each month making it easy to find the month that you're looking for without having to flip through pages.

"I've had a few Manhattan Toy dolls but this is by far one of my favorite. We just moved into a new house and of course my toddler refused to sleep in her own bed because she was now in a strange room. Although all her old furniture is in the room she decided that the best place to sleep was in my bed. When we received the Baby Stella Sweet Dreams I decided to introduce it to her as a way to transition to her new room. The soothing lavender scent isn't overpowering and actually smells pretty good. The fact that the doll is soft all over makes it the perfect bedtime toy. No hard heads or limbs to bump into in the middle of the night. She loved taking the clothes off and trying to put them on by herself. Great learning doll as well and if you have a baby in the family, it's great to teach your little one how to hold the doll and feed it properly, instead of giving them their baby brother or sister. The magnets gives it a nice touch.So why did I give it 4 stars? Well since the smell is released by hugs, if you have a child who loves hugging after a while the scent will become too much. It is also pretty pricey for a doll, maybe wait for a price drop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TEP6ICOIUZ7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TR0C3P4#wasThisHelpful","R3TEP6ICOIUZ7F","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't let the price fool you, this is a really great piece of jewelry. The size of the pendant is about the size of a nickel and the diamonds of course are almost invisible but still this makes a great graduation gift for your teenage daughter. If they're fans of silver it could quite possibly be their very first ""diamond"" piece. It comes packaged in pretty box that is perfect for gifting.

"Received this and placed this in my guest bathroom. It's a beautiful lace design but you'll need a liner of course. I love the fact that it is machine washable because being white you know that it will show up dirt rather quickly. However I'm not so sure how much it will hold up in the wash since the quality isn't that great in my opinion. It is rather pretty thin which means of course that it is totally see through.

"I live in a ranch style home with a walk out basement. I with Comcast and pay for their Extreme Internet package which is supposed to give me 150Mbps download. With our router and modem connected downstairs sometimes those upstairs weren't able to connect and we would still have dropped connection. We currently have the Motorola SurfBoard SB6141 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem connected to this router and so far we haven't had any problems.As far as the set up process, it took me quite a few hours to get it set up even with their guide. I wish that Linksys would make their set up a lot easier. I've never had a problem setting up my Netgear router and I hope Linksys would get with the program. Plug and Play is definitely the way to go.I have to state that we usually have 3 computers on at any one time along with 2 smart TV's possibly watching Netflix or Hulu, along with 3 Xbox One's and a PS4. At any given time they may all be in use and so far I have actually seen an improvement in my connection. I'm finally getting what I paid for from my cable company.As far as the price, its on par with what new technology cost these days. I expect it to drop in a few months.

"We recently got a Siberian Husky and I wanted the best for him. Before him we had a Shih-Tzu that we had since he was 8 weeks old. A few months ago my toddler opened the front door and he got out in the yard. By the time I realized he was outside, he was gone, someone stole him. We decided that we would get another to fill the void of losing our beloved Gizmo so got Shadow. His owner stated that he was being fed Pedigree Puppy. I've never used Pedigree dog food but decided to take a look at the ingredients and wasn't happy. If you're a pet owner you know that you have to mix their food until he gets used to the new food. I initially bought Blue Wilderness because that's what we were feeding our Shih-Tzu but after hearing the debacle with Blue about where they were getting their ingredients etc, I decided to switch to Wellness CORE and I have no regrets. Not only is it cheaper but it's also a pretty darn good puppy food and the ingredients are just as good. He was able to tolerate the switch pretty well and I'm hoping this is the last switch we will have to make until he weans off puppy food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FA30M61E379S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007M0J7Z0#wasThisHelpful","R1FA30M61E379S","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed something for my toddler daughter for special occasion and I've always been a fan of Pink Sugar in my younger years. Now that I'm older (almost 40) my taste have matured. I use this whenever we go to church etc and the fragrance last a very long time. I don't spray it directly on my skin but on her clothing before she puts in on and everyone says how sweet she looks and smells. The price is really good compared to what you pay at Sephora and I've read reviews stating that this is fake. I got mine directly from Amazon and it does have a little lighter scent that what I knew before but it still lasts a long time. I'm thinking the manufacturer might just be making it differently.

I bought these for my toddler as she has wide feet and this brand has always been one that accommodated that. She wears a size 9 1/2 so I got her the size 10 and she wears them with socks and so far we've had no issues. She runs around in them and has worn them for a few hours at a time. I originally bought the mocha but loved it so much also got the grape. We love the fact that she can put it on by herself since the laces are really more for decoration purpose since it has a side zipper.

"I have kids so what that means is that I usually have a dirty vehicle filled with sand from the park, left over food, you name it, it's in my car. I usually take my car to the car wash to get it cleaned and then every once in a while I take it to get a thorough cleaning if I can't do it myself. This little vac has saved me quite a bit of money so far. While it doesn't leave my vehicle looking like it just got detailed it comes really close. I was able to vacuum the sand and grime from my minivan and when I picked up my son from school he asked, did you get your car cleaned today. I said ""Yup I sure did,  and I did it myself"". My daughter uses it on her VW Beetle Convertible and now she refuses to take her car in as well.This little vac has great suction power and the filter that's included helps keep the dust down. I've so far only used 2 of the extensions, the slim one (the crevice tool) which gets ever nook and cranny and the brush which I use when vacuuming.It was super easy to put together and so far we've only used it as a dry vac.

So naturally she was drawn to this High Heel Stapler. Should have named it ""High Hell Stapler"" because it was hell to get it to staple a few pieces of paper together. First of all beware, it does not comes with staples (not even a starter pack like most staplers) so you'll have to buy the special one that they say you need.

It does make your iPhone a bit heavier but that's to be expected, after all this is a whole other battery that's being added to your iPhone. Otterbox claims that this extends your battery life but I couldn't see it personally. It doesn't take long to charge but to me it seems like it drained just as easily and maybe even easier than the original iPhone itself. The biggest issue I had is that there is no screen protection on this at all. You'll have to buy a screen protector for your iPhone. Kinda defeats the purpose of having major protection doesn't it?

"I have a Himalayan who isn't particularly picky. I'm saying she would eat our dog's food if you aren't watching. I've used Wellness Complete Natural before and while she loved it she wasn't that big of a fan so I switched her to Merrick Before Grain which she loves. The first ingredient is chicken and she's a big fan of meat. When offered to review the Wellness TruFood I decided to give it a try. After all it had wholesome ingredients and I always look at the ingredients before buying food for my pets, after all they're family. My Siberian Husky is currently using Wellness Core Puppy Food (currently transitioning from Blue Wilderness Puppy after hearing the complaints about Blue) and he loves it too. There are no by-meat products and we love that chicken is the first ingredient in both of their foods.The first time I offered her this food she basically ran through the food in less than 5 minutes and was still licking her tongue. She knows the sound of the bag being opened and I have caught her trying to claw her way into it to get it open herself. I've seen reviews about picky eaters not liking this food but my cat is totally the opposite. If your cat isn't too picky he/she might like it as much as mine does.

It did take a while to heat up, which is a bummer if youâ€™re in a hurry.Within a few minutes my hair was as straight as a board. Keep in mind I have thick hair, so the ceramic flat iron works great on hair of my thickness. The hot brush part of the styler is not ideal for making cute little singlet curls. Instead, itâ€™s ideal for curling your hair under or out.Comparing the price against products just like it, the InStyler Ionic Styler Pro Ionic Hot Brush and Ceramic Flat Iron is an investment.

"I haven't always been a fan of Huggies  but I can say that I love these Pull-Ups. The cooling feature has been working great on my toddler. She hasn't really been wanting to use the potty and it's been a struggle. She's not consistent. One minute she wants to use the potty, the next she couldn't be bothered. Since using these she has been wanting to use the potty a lot more. I think it's the cooling feature. Whenever she goes she doesn't like feeling the coolness on her bum so she wants to keep it dry. While these would be fine for daytime use, I would prefer her not to sleep in them so I don't use them for sleeping. Kids go in their diapers when they're asleep and feeling cool all night long isn't something that I want her to feel, especially since she's such a heavy sleeper.I love the fact that the front and back are easily to see with these and she just love the Disney characters on these as well. So while they're great for daytime use I'll look for something else for night time, unless of course you're training your toddler to wake up and use the potty at night.

"Having the right set of bottles for a newborn baby is extremely important. The Philips AVENT Classic Plus Newborn Starter Set comes with several different sizes of bottles, which makes caring and feeding a newborn extremely easy on the parents. Obviously the smaller bottles work perfectly for a newborn. I love it because you donâ€™t have to waste formula or breastmilk by adding too much to a bottle.The bottle cleaner is a huge bonus for me in this newborn starter pack. I love how the bottle cleaner is made. If you notice, when you use the bottle cleaner, it gets every corner of the bottle and is very well made. I think Avent bottles are very easy to clean and this bottle cleaner is to thank!You'll also love the idea that you're set for your babyâ€™s first 0-12 months when you purchase this bottle set. You can even transform them into sippy cups, which is awesome feature for me.The bigger Avent bottles work perfect for the baby who is growing and needs more to eat. Everything you need for your new baby is right in this newborn starter kit from Avent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12O7AEPWFW34T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF8AYMQ#wasThisHelpful","R12O7AEPWFW34T","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When it comes to feeding a baby, a mom wants to do whatâ€™s best! I have used many bottles in the past but the best bottle I have found on the market has been from AVENT. Our babies have always been colicky and Iâ€™ve searched high and low for a bottle that will help our situation. The bottle helps prevent air from going in the babyâ€™s tummy (air is believed to upset the babyâ€™s tummy).The nipple has also worked wonders with our children. Iâ€™ve never had a nipple confusion problem while switching between nursing and bottle feeding with our babies. Can I also say that these AVENT bottles are SUPER easy to clean?! These are by far my favorite bottles for any baby ages 0-12 months.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37X4KSUM94QIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF8ACFU#wasThisHelpful","R37X4KSUM94QIU","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Breastfeeding has always been a huge part of my life with my little ones. However, unthawing breastmilk and having it readily available for my child can be tough. There are times when you cannot nurse or need to leave the baby with someone else. I donâ€™t like unthawing breastmilk unless I know Iâ€™m going to use it. The Phillips AVENT bottle warmer can defrost breastmilk in a matter of minutes. I also love that it warms the bottle evenly, so I donâ€™t have to worry about cold chunks of ice upsetting the baby. Of course, warming evenly also means there are no hot spots either. I love having a trusted brand like AVENT in my home, knowing it can help make my life as a mom a whole lot easier is the topping on the cake.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HV3KO5LMJQ11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJ64JR4#wasThisHelpful","R1HV3KO5LMJQ11","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With little boys in the household Cars is a huge deal around here. We waited until the little ones had gone to bed and had the 9 year old set up the Cozy Cone and Mack, along with the Tractor Tippinâ€™ and Pit Stop Launchers. They got up and sat down to eat breakfast as usual. About halfway through breakfast, our three year old goes, â€œHey, Whatâ€™s Mack doing over there?â€ and breakfast was over. The rest of the day was spent in Cars heaven.The playsets are all modular so they can be arranged a bunch of different ways, including using the Pit Stop Launcher next to Doc Hudsonâ€™s garage, which makes a great launching ramp. The sets are pretty well built, although there are a lot of small pieces so little ones have to be watched. They have a good level of detail, there are road signs, billboards and overhead wires - right down to the â€œplasmaâ€ inside of Mackâ€™s trailer. Assembly is required, but our nine year old handled it all.

"We've had a few other T.S. Shure products and I have to say that I just love them. With a toddler who is into Jake and the Neverland Pirate I knew that she would love this and I was right. This comes with quite a few pieces (40 to be exact) and all attach magnetically to the 2 characters included. I love the fact that it comes with the plastic carrying case that has a snap closure that makes it easy for her to take with her whenever we visit friends. Also keeps the pieces safe and secure in the bag. It's a great toy and will keep your little ones entertained for quite some time. She just loves changing the clothing and making her own outfits. The pieces are well made and I have had no complaints with the others I've gotten either. This would be a great toy for all the little pirate fans in your life.

"I've had quite a lot of baby monitors. My toddler is exactly that, a toddler and sleeps in her own room. She's in her room most of the time playing her toys, trying to read, watching a movie, whatever she's doing in there I like to keep an eye on her. She loves to climb and I have even caught her on her dresser trying to mess with her TV. It's one of the reason why I still use a baby monitor. I love knowing that I can check up on her without her knowing (she knows) but I also like to give her her space and not barge in her room like a helicopter mom.Having a monitor with video has always been one of the main options for me. I couldn't just have sound, I need to see what she's up to. This was however disappointing, while it wasn't too bad it not at all what I expected. For a price tag of $200 I expected high quality picture and what I got wasn't. I've used Motorola which has an excellent picture and even VTech's monitors are pretty good. It was difficult seeing her at night and even during the day it's not as clear as I would like it to be.The range on this monitor is pretty good and so is the sound. The 2 way communicator is also good. I'm now able to talk to her without going in the room and have her answer me. Imagine her surprise the first time she was doing something she wasn't and I spoke to her. Having control of the camera is also really nice.The app for this is also pretty good. I was able to download it on my S5 and I'm able to use it in the house and outside. Pretty cool! Now I would give this about a 3 1/2 stars. I wish the video quality was better but I really can't recommend buying this at this price tag. There are other monitors out there that do just as good a job for a whole lot less.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R60AUX1J4JD3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5QTESS#wasThisHelpful","R60AUX1J4JD3T","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most important parts of being a new mom is making sure youâ€™re in touch with your baby at all times. The Phillips Avent Baby Monitor is very simple to put together and doesnâ€™t take longer than a minute to set up. I like how easy the directions were to follow and all I had to do was add batteries or plug in the baby monitor to the outlet.A lot of baby monitors in todayâ€™s day and age are so high tech that you canâ€™t even figure them out. The Phillips Avent Baby Monitor is budget friendly and also technologically friendly. I didnâ€™t have to spend my whole day trying to figure out how it works. Time is precious to me as a mom and I appreciate the time this baby monitor didnâ€™t take from me.Itâ€™s pure joy to hear your baby cooing or talking, but to also get to them quickly when they need you. The Phillips Avent Baby Monitor offers no static and I can hear whatâ€™s going on in the other room very clearly.

"If you are like most people youââ‚¬â„¢re probably wondering what the point of a separate router is when most modern cable and DSL modems have routers built into them.There are a couple of reasons, the first one is range.  If you are in an apartment, this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really an issue.  In medium sized and larger houses, or if you want to use Wi-Fi in the yard and garage, the range on your modem probably wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cut it.  This is a strong selling point for the Netgear N300.  The external antennas give a solid boost to the range and strength of signal.The second big selling point to a third party router is security.  Your modem comes with a certain set of preset security options, but making changes isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always easy and with so many of them in use, there is a big incentive for black hats to figure out how to exploit any weaknesses.  The Netgear has a number of great security features built into it, even beyond its ease of use.  It has a Guest mode that allows you to let guests connect to your router without giving them the ability to change settings in the router itself.  In addition you can allow a guest to access other devices on your network but not the internet, or the other way around.  The Netgear also has built in parental controls to give you the ability to filter what web pages can or cannot be seen on your network.  This is great for letting your kids use the computer without worrying as much about them stumbling across content that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t age appropriate.  It is, of course, no substitute for monitoring them, but it lets you build up the freedom they are allowed.The third big selling point of the Netgear is the Netgear Genie App.  This is a easy to use home network manager that lets you seamlessly share between your PCs/Macs and phones (both Android and Apple).  It also lets you make any printer Airprint compatible for easy printing from your phone or tablet.The last main reason is bandwidth.  If you have several devices connected to your modemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wireless and all are making heavy use of the internet, it is possible that you will see performance degrade as it struggles to meet the demand.  The Netgear N300 is capable of speeds up to 300 Mbp/s, meaning that unless you are lucky enough to have and EXTREMELY fast internet connection, your internet connection will be your bottleneck long before your router will be.The Netgear is easy to set up, easy to use and offers a lot of great utilities, making it a worthwhile upgrade over the capabilities of your cable or DSL modem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AAA6MSX6GX8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVJYEI#wasThisHelpful","R3AAA6MSX6GX8B","A2K75QOCP9ZHSL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2K75QOCP9ZHSL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My best friend recently had her very first baby and when I say this is a lifesaver I mean it. Where was this when I had my own kids 18 years ago. Back then I did everything manually and I did so 3 years ago when I had my toddler as well but this would have saved me so much time. It is super easy to use, instructions were well written and the concept was well laid out. Now you don't have to worry that you're putting ""too much or too little"" formula in the bottle. Love the two temperature setting and my thing I would say is that I wished that the tank held a lot more water for those growth spurt days when you need just a bit more.Cleaning was super easy and I can't recommend this anymore than I do right now.

"My toddler is at that age where she does pretend play very well. We got another T.S. Shure product recently and she loved it. When given the chance to try out this magnetic Pocket Bear I jumped at the opportunity because not only does she like playing with dolls, but she also enjoys dressing them. This was a way to do both things and have fun while doing it.The set comes with 2 bears and lots of pieces to dress up. When they say they're magnetic they truly meant it. She dresses them in whatever style she wants, complete with top, bottom and shoes and they actually stay on when she holds her bear upside down. There are so many different pieces that allows her to be creative.The set comes in a wooden box used for storing the pieces when she's done playing and there's a clear plastic lid that slides on that keeps them in place. Its also light enough that she can take it with her if we decide to go visiting.I do recommend this set highly.

"If you have a newborn you know that there are times when you need a break and this is such a lifesaver in that fashion. Most babies like motion and if you have dinner to make, homework to help with, you're going to have to put that baby down. The Fisher Price Moonlight Meadow Deluxe Cradle n Swing is there to help you. The assembly for this was pretty easy and took less than 20 minutes to do.Not every baby likes the standard back and forth motion so I was happy to see that this includes side by side. Now the reason I say this is a money saver is that it uses an AC adapter, meaning it can be plugged into the wall. Now you don't have to keep this in the same place all the time because it also uses 4D batteries as well. So you can move from room to room or even take it outside on the patio for baby to have some time outdoors in the fresh air (weather permitting of course).The smart swing technology is awesome because I remember in the days of having to actually push the swing in order to make it move. With smart swing technology (from what I gathered) it measures your baby and swings accordingly. It says according to the instructions that the speed won't slow down as your baby grows so I'm hoping that's true. The seat reclines and the fabric is pretty nice too. Baby is almost snuggled in it.While the color is unisex, I however found that this would be better for a little boy since I love getting pinks for girls, but it can be used for both genders. I do however wish that the mobile was a little better and the mirror isn't too bad either. After all who doesn't like looking at themselves? I recommend this as a great gift for all new moms, and even those that aren't quite new.

After all I personally won't spend this much money unless there were guaranteed results, or it was recommended by a friend. I've tried cheaper products that just seemed as though I've wasted my money.I have been using it for close to two weeks now and I think that while this might not be a fair review since I'm sure you'll have to use it a lot longer than that to actually see the difference, from what I've seen I can recommend this. Now the reason I took off a star was not because of the price but because I had a little mild irritation while using it. I would recommend testing it out on your hands before using it on your face. Although I did that and my hands turned out fine. It was my face that turned slightly red.This has pearls on the inside that when pumped comes out in a milky like consistency. You can also feel a slight difference when using it and I must say that it was great to actually feel it. Others takes days before you can actually see it but this one was so much faster.

"I happened to be looking for mattresses for my boys bunk bed and purchased one just a few days before being offered this one from Amazon Vine. The other I purchased was a little bit more expensive than this one. I had actually bypassed this one because of price and now I wish I hadn't. It came compressed which made it easy for me a female to take to their room. Usually I would have to have help from hubby to do things like this but this surely made it super easy. It came packed again in a bag and once I opened the bag and took it out the plastic it expanded fully. I didn't notice any ""new"" smell like some stated and the room didn't have any windows opened so I would have noticed it. Once I put it on the bed (all by myself) my son couldn't wait to get on. I actually had to test it out before he did and while it's not as soft as I like my mattress it's not too firm either. I would say that this is close to a medium/firm. It is super comfortable but more for kids and not adults. I personally couldn't see myself laying on this every night. I'm 160lbs and I was able to feel the springs a little. My son who is about 100lbs though said that he couldn't feel them so it's great for him. If I was a smidge lighter this would have been the perfect mattress for me.

"I have ""collected"" all the Assassin's Creed game sine Desmond was the star in the original Assassins Creed 1 which is by far one of the most difficult to play. It took me a while but I finally got a hang and love for the game. So when AC2 came out I was all over it and totally loved it. I spent hours and hours playing, trying to find the collectibles, trying to 100% all my assassinations. It seems that every year a new game comes out and they keep going from bad to worse. This is by far one of the worst that I have yet to play.Unity feels like a game that was rushed to market to make a quick few dollars. Looking at the price it is now I'm really not surprised that the price has dropped that significantly this quickly. Don't worry after purchasing this game Ubi wants you to pop a few more of your hard dollars once again. There is also a companion app that is required for you to even a few chests. If you're not happy with that, then I assume you won't be happy with the game glitching either. I'm consistently being stuck and have to turn it on/off. The graphics also aren't as great as predecessors.

The 3-in-1 tightly attaches to our dining room chair and sits up to the table just right. Your little one will be so excited that they get to sit and the table and join the rest of the family!I love that it swivels to easily get your little one in and out of the seat.  It has straps to keep them safe when they start to fidget or doesn't want to stay sitting.  I wish we'd had this when our toddler was younger too. The attachable tray and reclining seat are great for smaller babies.  I love that it can grow with your child!The fabric is easy to wipe clean.  The cover is easy to remove if it needs a thorough cleaning.  I love the print and colors of the Abbington because it is more grown up and elegant for the dining room.My nephew and his wife are expecting this summer and I'll be purchasing one for them.

"What follows is a long-winded review, read this around bedtime if you are having trouble falling asleep! ;-) For those seeking the Reader's Digest version - overall, I think the Freiling French Press, though expensive, is the best French Press money can buy. I have tried offerings from 4-5 other French Press makers, including Espro and Bodum, and the Freiling IMHO has the highest quality build, has the best heat retention capability during the brew cycle, and will be the most durable long term due to its 100% 18/10 stainless construction - no plastic parts here!!. It is one of the very few 100% stainless French Presses you can find - plus it also a very attractive vessel to boot! I actually leave it out on my counter due to its good looks!! There are many good reasons why the Freiling French Press are the best sellers, and why reviews here on Amazon are so plentiful and positive. Amongst those reasons are quality, reliability, consistency and durability.Do realize however, that just because you spend the money and buy a Freiling will NOT guarantee you will automatically start making great coffee - as with any French Press the method is more important than the tool! You must pay attention to ALL of the variables involved in correct coffee extraction procedures - if you want the best coffee possible with a French Press, it is all about the process - assuring correct brew temperature, you use freshly ground beans, you are using an adequate grinder that grinds to consistent texture, and more!! Below I offer some tips to assuring a great cup of coffee with the Freiling, those may help in your pursuit of the perfect cup!!Just as important - do realize that the Freiling is a BREWING vessel ;-) and not a STORAGE carafe. You will see in the reviews that some complain the Freiling does not keep their coffee ""hot"" for hours - the coffee should only stay in the Freiling for around four minutes to brew, you will need a nice storage carafe to keep it hot thereafter!! Those that keep the coffee in the press with the grounds after the four minute mark are destroying the taste. Moreover, even if you transfer the coffee out, and remove the grounds and then use the Freiling as your storage vessel - you would be much better served purchasing a separate carafe to store the coffee when done. The Freiling is NOT an ideal storage carafe. (For example - I use a Zojirushi glass lined carafe for my needs).***End of Reader's Digest version - now on to the details!!Here is what I like about the Freiling Press:- Double Wall carafe construction - this is both ideal and necessary for the ever-so critical heat retention during your preheating and steeping phases. The method I employ can hold brew temps between 195 and 204 throughout the entire steeping / brewing phase, and I could never accomplish that with other presses made of glass, plastic, etc. Some have claimed that the Freiling is vacuum sealed in addition, but it is not - it is double walled and that is it. *** Note - I typically keep my brew temps around 200-202 degrees - please Google ""SCAA recommended coffee brewing temperatures"" for some background on correct temps to brew / extract coffee**- 100% 18/10 stainless - beautifully finished, but it is more than just good looks - the thick stainless assures the press will last for a long time and it will aid in heat retention already mentioned. It is durable and virtually indestructible if used with any modicum of care and not dropped daily on the tile! My 33oz Freiling is 3 years old, and it operates like the day I bought it. Plus, it still looks good also - other than a couple of minor scratches to the polished stainless exterior.- Top / Plunger assembly comes apart for thorough cleaning. You get a sense of the attention to detail and the cost it takes to make a Freiling press when you disassemble the constituent parts that make up the top / plunger. It wreaks of quality through and through... the fact it can be disassembled, and remains 100% stainless is no small feat, and a testament to the quality - and why it costs so much. Consider what it takes to be able to deliver this assembly - and why competing press makers don't!- Double walled top / lid - I already mentioned the double walled carafe - but the fact the lid is ALSO double walled construction is worth calling out- again, the competitors don't even approach this and even make their tops / lids out of PLASTIC says it all.- They are darned nice to look at! Let's face it - they are an attractive vessel.Here is what I don't like about the Freiling:- Price - this one is more of a whine ;-) and not anything wrong with the product, but hey, I can still not like it! Bottom line is I would still buy it again.. To make it less painful, I got this 44oz version for $98 here on Amazon - it was in my cart for over a year in the $125 range, and when I saw the price drop temporarily I jumped on it!- The top on my 33oz version had a weld seam failure around the hole where the plunger is inserted - causing the top to fill with water that I could not get back out. HOWEVER, Freiling sent me a new top when I asked with no hassle... it was a ""one-off"" problem and don't expect it to happen on my other Freilings.- I can't think of anything of substance I DON'T like about the Freiling - if you learn how to use it, perfect your method then this is the top of the heap when it comes to French Press. It is the best tool for the Press job IMHO.I have owned the 33 oz Freiling Stainless Press for a few years and have used it almost daily to make my morning coffee (except for the once a week I use my Technivorm drip brewer). Therefore, I do have experience with Freiling's presses, and understand how to best utilize them to squeeze out the optimal cup of coffee.Some pointers / things to think about as you pursue the ""perfect"" cup of coffee:- Make sure and pre-heat your Press and storage carafe in advance - don't put your coffee / boiling water into a cold French Press; and don't put your finished product in a cold storage carafe!!! (google it, this affects the taste). At a minimum, use hot tap water to pre-heat, which usually gets to 130-140 degrees. Personally, I use boiling water to pre-heat - you can boil it on the stove, or perhaps use something like a Zojirushi hot water kettle / boiler that is ready in advance when you wake!- Use fresh beans, and grind the beans right before use. Coffee beans are best within two weeks of roasting, and most store bought beans can be MANY weeks old by the time you buy them. If you can find a local source for your beans that are fresh, do it. You will notice a marked improvement in your finished product.- Buy a decent quality grinder. The $20 blade grinders are just not good enough for French Press - it needs a consistent, coarse grind. At a minimum, I recommend a Capresso Infinity for around $70, then use the ""Coarse"" settings, dialing it in to where you eliminate 95% of the sludge in your cup. I use an Orphan Espresso LIDO hand grinder ($150), and alternate that with a Capresso Infinity. You can also get a Baratza Virtuoso if you want to spend more! The grind is CRITICAL - it needs to be the correct coarseness - but more importantly needs to be CONSISTENT. Consistency is the main challenge for most cheap grinders on the market.- Assure your steeping / brewing temperatures are in the 195-204 degree range. This is not my own recommendation, this is the ""proven"" range for the best coffee extraction. Invest in something like a Thermapen, or a cheaper temperature probe, that allows you to test the water temperature while steeping. Another critical step to success. For my brewing, I stay in the 200-202 range typically during the four minute brew cycle. *** Note - please Google ""SCAA recommended coffee brewing temperatures"" for some background on correct temps to brew / extract coffee**- Depress the plunger SLOWLY when it is time, doing it too fast will cause sediment. Also, if the plunger seems to get ""stuck"", lift it ever so slightly, then depress again!- Fill the water level BELOW the spout depression / line in the carafe when filling for brewing / steeping. This will help guarantee less grounds in your finished product.To summarize - now that you have spent the $$ on a top of the line French Press, consider getting a good grinder that can consistently grind on a coarse setting without a lot of ""fines"" in the grind; considerr purchasing a good temperature probe (like a Thermapen to check your temperatures of different components throughout the process to find what needs tweaking; consider getting fresh coffee beans. This will give you an even better cup in the end... also, search the web for you tube videos, etc on different processes, find out what works best for you. Once you experience a ""perfectly"" executed cup of press coffee, you will be hooked!! ;-)Thanks for reading, and best of luck in your choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387M40MD5RL8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FV2TJA#wasThisHelpful","R387M40MD5RL8D","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How did I go so many years without this stuff in my shop, or in my car, or in my backpack? Every day I think of new ways to use this stuff.... for instance, today - I was filling a small spray bottle with bug repellent for my backpack, and I was concerned about the top coming unscrewed slightly causing a potential leak. Well, I pulled out my clear version of this same tape, and wrapped it around the top where it screws on, now I am confident it will hold.Yesterday, my weedeaters foam grip was cracking splitting - out comes the black Silicone tape to the rescue to provide a new grip for the handle. The day before, my tent pole plastic end cap was not staying on the pole, again, Silicone tape to the rescue.Then, when I was weedeating my lawn, I noticed my trusty outdoor electrical cord took a hit with either the weedeater or hedger, and had a couple of chunks of the outer sheathing missing. I used my Xtreme tape (in the Red color to match the cord ;-)) and it has been holding for weeks and about 4 uses, I don't see why it won't hold for a very long time.Next, both my backpacking and camping tent poles have vinyl or plastic ends on the poles - and after time these loosen up, want to come off and worse yet get lost! Well, not only does Xtreme tape fuse the tent pole ends to the pole, it also reinforces them and makes them stronger and more durable...And then the big test - my garden hose had a pin-hole leak in it, and I applied this tape to it. The key is to make sure you extend the tape on either side of the hole by a few inches (I did three inches on each side of the hole) - and then make sure you stretch the tape very well and evenly around the hose. Also, make sure the hose is on a flat surface, and try to avoid flexing / bending the hose while taping, keep it as straight as possible. Also, give it at least two windings (not just one). It is working fine, if there are any issues I will update.You get it. This stuff is amazing. Once you wind it on itself it sticks like white on rice. Its resiliency is quite good - it is very tough and it will not come unwound unless you intentionally start to pull on the seam. Then, it will rip instead of lose its contact... it is that sticky to itself.The list goes on.... like I said, I keep finding more uses for it daily.I would say just get a roll, and keep it around.

"Hario claims that the design of it's coffee drippers sets it apart from the competitors - and that the raised helical grooves combined and the larger opening at the bottom result in a better cup.  Now, I am not an coffee engineer ;-), and I am not going to attempt to explain how this may or may not result in a better cup - but I will say that the Hario V60 has become my go to pour over dripper, and I have since given my others away!I currently own the V60 in both the 02 (one glass, one platic) and 01 (palstic only) sizes - I use the 01 and 02 in plastic for my backpacking trips, as it is always nice to have good coffee on the trail, and the plastic versions only weigh 2 ounces and are a lightweight method to make superb coffee in the backcountry!  ALl you need other the dripper is a light paper filter - along with some coffee (pre-ground of course).  I use the glass version at home. I like pour over as an option when I want to be able to choose how much coffee I want instead of having to make full pot, a full press, or something different than a shot of espresso.As most know, good coffee is more about the process of how you make it - along with using fresh ground coffee, and brewing at the right temperature for the right amount of time - there is a lot to consider and pay attention to if you are looking for the best cup - but if you take the time to learn it and experiment, you will be rewarded.  Definitely take the time to search / research how others are making their coffee to supplement your process - you will find what works the best for you, and when you get better coffee, it will only serve to reproduce that cup over and over again. It is kind of fun!Some tips to using the Hario:- Make sure and pre-wet the filter inside the cone before putting your ground coffee in.  I use hot / boiling water with my cup underneath - this serves many purposes - first it pre-heats the cup.  Second, it forms the filter to the dripper.  Third, it takes any paper taste out of the filter.- Grind your coffee on the finer side of the drip range - if it is too coarse, the larger hole will result in the coffee draining too quickly through the dripper, and not interacting with the grounds long enough.  Experiement, and when you achieve a slow drip, and the taste is not too bitter or sour, you have nailed the grind.- Pre-infuse your grinds before brewing.  What I do is first make a small divot / hole gently in the middle of your grounds after pouring them in the dripper. Pour enough water over your grounds to soak the coffee,just to the point where it begins to drip - then stop pouring and wait 30-60 seconds.  For me, if I am making 14 oz of finished coffee as my target, I preinfuse with about 2 oz of water.- Pour SLOWLY, and do it in two or three phases.  I pour about 4-5 oz of water in slowly, let it drip through, and then do it again. After two - three passes, I am done.  I never pour the entire contents of my water in all at the same time.- Try to pour water in that is between 195 and 205 degrees - this range is the optimal temperature range for extracting / brewing coffee.  Google SCAA or optimal brewing temp for coffee for more details.  I utilize a Bonavita variable temperature kettle for my process, it makes keeping the water in the right range very easy.- Some of the ratios I use is 27 grams of coffee for 14oz of finished product, or 19 grams for 10 oz finished product.Try to drink the coffee in the first 10-15 minutes - coffee always tastes the best when it does not sit for any length of time....I would recommend the Hario V60 to anyone looking at trying pour over - it is cheap, has a proven design, is easy to use, easy to clean up, and makes one great cup of coffee.Thanks for reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E7DRJYKHR847/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VUSWGQ#wasThisHelpful","R1E7DRJYKHR847","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have found this a versatile tool, and get a lot of use out of it.  Granted, the 600 grit does not make this a finishing grit / sharpener for the finest edge on your best knives, but that is not why I bought it.Here are some of the ways I use this sharpener:- The thin / low profile of this sharpener make it a great tool for gardening tools with curved edges.  My flat sharpeners struggle with the tight confines and curved edges of pruners, shears and other cutting tools.  However, this tool is an excellent choice for those tools - between the flat spot on the round edge and the rounded portion, this makes quick work of my garden cutting tools.- Touching up my fishing hooks and lures - I throw this in my tackle box to give my hooks and lures a new point when needed.  The groove in the rounded side makes quick work of hooks and lures.-  For hiking / backpacking - this tool is lightweight and low profile, and is a good choice hiking, camping and even backpacking for a lightweight tool when you need something to touch up a knife edge, smooth off the corner of a dinged tent pole, or anything where a metal burr needs to be knocked down.- For touching up a serrated edge - the pointed end of this was made for re-honing serrated edges, and I use it for my Spyderco serrated edge, or even for the first pass on my serrated kitchen knives.  The pointed end also works good in tight spots, like low clearance pruners and cutters where it is tough to get other sharpening tools in a tight spot.This sharpener is small enough to stick in a day pack, clip in your pocket while doing chores or on the go. I would recommend this sharpener to anyone looking for something small and compact that needs a sharpener where others might not do the job, or when you want something that packs nicely.Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CPPR29L5EGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001910FOA#wasThisHelpful","R1CPPR29L5EGH","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this same product 4 to 5 years ago, and was very pleased with the contents, the quality of the outer bag, and the quality of the inner compartment bag.  Well, unfortunately, when I repurchased this recently, it did not match up to the quality of what I purchased previously - read on for details.Since our backpacking party has grown to 3-4 people consistently, I decided to purchase a second kit, mainly for a second bag / contents that I could customize.  I had a choice of getting a bigger first aid kit / bag, and abandoning the smaller Ultralight 5  kit / bag I bought a few years back (same model as this one) - or getting a second Ultralight 5 kit and splitting two smaller kits between multiple backpacks. I chose the latter - namely, buy a second smaller kit like this one, and split it between multiple packs.  (any backpacker can relate - split up the weight when you have the luxury of multiple people in the party).When I received this kit, it was immediately apparent that this was not of the same quality of the  previous Ultralight 5kit I bought.  To summarize my findings and opinion, here is what I found:  -  The outer bag is thinner, not as durable and just plain not as well made as the previous version I bought a few years back.  The bag from the previous version is a joy to use - and has held together perfectly, very well made.  -  The quality of the zipper on the bag is awful - not even close to the zipper on the previous version I own.  This zipper gets stuck, and is just plain hard to open or close without fits and starts. Terrible.  -  The inner compartment bag has a very poor seal, and just does not stay shut.  Realize this inner bag is what provides your waterproofing, so I have VERY low confidence that my kit will be protected from water.  -  THe quality of the medical contents - the packaging, appearance, everything about the contents just looks cheap and just not of the same level of quality of what I already owned.  The bandaids seem cheaper, for example.Like many things these days, the same product you bought years ago has been cheapened, with corners cut to save cost and increase margins.  Personally, I find this very disappointing, especially when it is in the area of first aid, or something you use in case of injury or emergency.  WRONG place to cut corners and skimp!  Shame on Adventure Medical - I know I will look elsewhere next time.Thanks for reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R139MAXLPRRA5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009RIQBE#wasThisHelpful","R139MAXLPRRA5E","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Evernew soft bottle has an edge over the Platypus soft bottles in that the cap stays attached to the bottle when you drink out of it, or fill it. I own most every type and size of the Platypus soft sided bottles - from the 16 oz to the 2 Liter versions, including the Plus bottles! I also own both the Push / Pull and Closure caps on the Platypus - and the issue with both is that it is possible to lose them - especially the closure cap, as when you take it off to fill or drink, it can get misplaced. The push / pull cap at least stays on when you drink,but it has to be removed to fill it.That is where these Evernew bottles shine - the cap stays attached, and it is virtually impossible to lose it! But there are other nice features to the Evernew bottles that make them shine over the Platy bottles IMHO. For instance, the shock cord that is attached to the bottle - this allows you to roll up the bottle and secure it for portable storage. With the Platypus bottle, you need a rubber band, or a separate cord, or you have to supply your own shock cord (if you have it). The shock cord coming attached to the Evernew is a nice touch.Another bonus - the Evernew bottle threads directly on to the Sawyer Mini Filter, or the Sawyer Squeeze Filter! This means that when the crummy Sawyer bottles break (and they will), you can employ these as either your dirty reservoir, or clean reservoir. These bottles come in sizes up to 2 Liters, so if you need a bigger container, you can get one!In addition - I like the feel / durability of the Evernew bottle more than the Platypus. They stand up on their own better with liquid in them, have a stiffer feel, and for some reason they seem to dry faster than the Platypus when empty.And finally, and most importantly - these are priced well for the different sizes if you shop around. Considering I got this size for $8, and the 2 Liter size for $10, it would be tough to beat those prices for the quality you get.I would recommend these bottles to anyone looking for something compatible with Sawyer filters, or for just a standalone soft drinking bottle.Thanks for reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12LGKGG4GWDS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AQYY6K#wasThisHelpful","R12LGKGG4GWDS1","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are better sharpeners out there, and there are most certainly worse, but if you are trying to find a good sharpener for a decent price, these might be a contender.  This particular sharpener can quickly give a fine / sharp point, and are a good utility sharpener for utilitarian tasks.  I keep one(or two) in my woodshop, one in my carport near my chop / miter saw.  Note that these create almost too fine a point, but it is definitely sharp and it does it fast.  So if you are looking for a ""tougher"", less thin point, there might be better options.I have also given one each to my sons in high school for their backpacks - they have a Kum sharpener for their desk, and one of these for their pack.  THe sharpeners at school are not always maintained and sharp, so having these on hand is helpful for them.As of writing this review, these are priced at close to $5. I paid $2,79 for mine, and for that, it is a good balance of price and quality.For what I use these for, the size, shape, durability are perfect. I can drop then in my shirt or pants pocket easily, set them on a workbench... overall a good sharpener for the money.Thanks for reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQJUAHEM1BYAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E6C08E#wasThisHelpful","RQJUAHEM1BYAX","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What you keep reading is true - why pay more for cables  when you don't have to - and given the quality of these cables, and the fact you get TWO of them for $8 is precisely why I bought them!I am not going to go into any more detail except to say that Mediabridge has done a good job in most cases of offering cables that give a great level of quality for the price - and offering many an alternative to those cable makers that used to basically rip us off!

"We carry at least two of these on every backpacking trip, sometimes even three on longer trips.  We hike in groups of three or four, and most every one has one in their pack.  The uses for these are MANY, here are a few:- As a large ""Dirty"" reservoir for our Sawyer Squeeze or Sawyer Mini filters when we want filtered water ""on the go"".  These thread directly onto the Sawyer filter threads, and fit perfectly.  Having a 2 liter source for the dirty water means less dipping and transfer operations - and these are much more durable and user-friendly than the bottles Sawyer sells.- As a ""Clean"" reservoir for filtered water / storage when using our gravity filter in camp.  We don't hang our clean water reservoir, we only hang the dirty, and use something like this to catch the clean water.  Sometimes we fill two of these when we are setting up camp to have water for cooking , washing up, etc.  What makes this a decent storage reservoir is that you can put a push/pull cap on it and be able to have controlled and measured pouring...-  As a reserve reservoir for extra water when we might be away from water for a couple of days - when we know we may be away from water for a day or so, we fill our 3L bladders first, then fill this as a reserve in our pack.  Note these are not as thick as a bladder, so store / carry in your pack with care, and keep it protected.I have been using one of these bottles for two years now, over multiple trips, and it is still in serviceable / working condition.  Thus the durability of these bottles is not bad, and they last if you care them.If I had to think of any ""Cons"" for these bottles, or what I don't like about them:- It takes forever for them to dry after cleaning....the small opening and large volume means you have to find a nice place to store them for 2-3 days as they dry.  I live in AZ, which is very dry, I can only imagine how long it would take to dry in a humid climate!  I only clean these when we get home, I don't ever attempt drying them out on the trail.- The caps are not attached, and can get lost.  This is one of the big reasons I started using the Evernew soft bottles - the Evernew bottles have the cap attached to the bottle!!-  You have to carry a separate rubber band or shock cord to roll them up. Again, the Evernew bottle has a pigtail attached to facilitate rolling them up, where the Playtpus does not.Note that I recently have been alternating these bottles with the Evernew soft bottles - those are a decent alternative to these, and are priced in the same ballpark.  I purchased these Platypus bottles for $9.99, and the Evernew 2L for the same amount.A couple of tips and tricks:- I carry two caps for these - one closure cap, and a push / pull cap.  I do this for multiple reasons, the first one being in case I lose a cap. The Platy caps are not attached to the bottle like the Evernew, and could get lost.  The second reason is that if I am storing the reservoir as a backup water source in my pack, I don't want the tall push / pull cap protruding and screw on the closure cap.  On the flip side, if I am using it for water storage in camp, I use the push / pull cap for easy dispensing.- I got some 1/16th inch shock cord and made a permanent pigtail attached to the bottle so you can easily rollup up the bottle for compact storage.  This is copying what the Evernew bottle did with theirs, and idea which I really liked. In fact, I have other Platy soft bottles, and retrofitted this pigtail on those too!!  If you are wondering what I mean, see the picture.  The Platy is on the left with the added pigtail, and the Evernew is on the right with the stock pigtail.Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF605LPPRRRYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J2KEGY#wasThisHelpful","RF605LPPRRRYK","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Believe the reviews and the hype about the Para Military 2 --- the size, weight, feel and blade quality of this knife have made it an EDC classic! I had considered purchasing this knife for a few years before finally taking the plunge - now, I have been EDC'ing this knife since the day it arrived, and it is one fine knife that holds a keen edge, and holds it very well. I am really beginning to appreciate the S30V steel on the PM 2. S30V it is a very high quality knife steel!  I liked it so much, I bought both the plain edge and black blade versions of the knife!!  I like the black blade as much as the silver one - at first I was uncertain if the black blade would show scratches more - but after light use it appears to be a very durable coating.  I have read it will show signs of wear over time and use, so I don't expect the black coating to look new forever.I own four other Spyderco's - the Paramilitary 2 Silver Blade, Police Stainless, a Delica FRN and a Lil' Matriarch - and all have a lot of use between home, work, camping, hiking, backpacking, etc. But, the next backpacking trip will have this knife at my side, I enjoy the size and action of this knife a lot. It is very light for its size at 3.8 oz, and it has a very good feeling in the hand with the G10 handle. The balance is very good and most importantly it cuts like a dream. The locking mechanism has a good ""snap"" to it when opening, and it has just the right amount of stiffness on the action where it opens very smoothly.Owning the Delica with a 3"" blade and the Police with the 4"" blade makes me realize how perfect the 3.5"" blade of the PM 2 is for my hand size. The Delica always felt a little small and I carried mainly for its light weight.... likewise, the Police always felt a tad big, and heavy due to the all stainless construction. Then again, the Police was never an EDC for these reasons, I typically keep that for around the house duties.I am not a big fan of the blade release / locking mechanism on the PM 2, but that is a minor concern and does not even come close to outweighing all the positives about this knife.I liked this knife so much that I also ordered the Camo with the black blade - it is backordered and may take a few months to get it - but it will be worth the wait. I look forward to passing these knives on to my sons' some day....I highly recommend this knife..... Thanks for reading.EDIT: For those concerned about the number of ParaMilitary 2 fakes floating around out there, I thought I would add a few sentences...The first paramilitary 2 I purchased was sold / shipped by Amazon directly, and arrived with the box taped on both ends. (this was the plain edge, non-black version).  This gave me initial cause for concern, as the Spyderco factory does NOT tape the box (I called Spyderco and they verified that). I still have not found who taped the box, whether it is Amazon, or perhaps a 3rd party that might be supplying Amazon (note again, I called Spyderco directly, and they stated definitively they do NOT tape the boxes). Also, even though my first box was taped shut, the knife had definitely been used and handled previously - perhaps a return? I called Amazon, expressed my concern, and they sent a replacement out - which was brand new, never used. However, the box on the replacement was also taped... so my guess is Amazon is taping the boxes shut. The tape job is professional, uses rounded corners and is well done, but just a heads up.Next - as far as real vs fake - I spent a lot of time checking the knife I received from Amazon (both of them) and I am 100% confident that these are authentic. I checked all the known issues with the fakes, and none of them exist here.... this is an authentic Spyderco, so at the time of writing this, the current stock sold by Amazon looks good. Just don't be alarmed if your box arrives taped on both ends... both of the PM2's I purchased Fulfilled by Amazon were taped on both ends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3URZIPKE5SP6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W2XO1Y#wasThisHelpful","R3URZIPKE5SP6N","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What more can I say other than I like the White filters more than the Brown filters - I think the Brown filters are imparting just a tiny bit of paper / cardboard taste.Try this if you have both the white and brown filters on hand - set both of them up in a filter holder / cone, and then pre-wet both filters. Do you notice a slight ""wet paper"" smell emanating from the brown filter?  I do.Note that one of the keys to using these is to make sure you pre-wet them and let the water drip through them before loading with coffee and using them.  Also note these filters are custom made to fit the Hario 02 filter, and will not fit standard #2 coffee pour over cones.By the way, I am using these on both a glass and plastic Hario V02 cone filter, as probably expected.Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAY67YPAA77N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001U7EOYA#wasThisHelpful","RAY67YPAA77N4","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How did I go so many years without this stuff in my shop, or in my car, or in my backpack? Every day I think of new ways to use this stuff.... for instance, today - I was filling a small spray bottle with bug repellent for my backpack, and I was concerned about the top coming unscrewed slightly causing a potential leak. Well, I pulled out my clear version of this same tape, and wrapped it around the top where it screws on, now I am confident it will hold.Yesterday, my weedeaters foam grip was cracking splitting - out comes the black Silicone tape to the rescue to provide a new grip for the handle. The day before, my tent pole plastic end cap was not staying on the pole, again, Silicone tape to the rescue.Then, when I was weedeating my lawn, I noticed my trusty outdoor electrical cord took a hit with either the weedeater or hedger, and had a couple of chunks of the outer sheathing missing. I used my Xtreme tape (in the Red color to match the cord ;-)) and it has been holding for weeks and about 4 uses, I don't see why it won't hold for a very long time.Next, both my backpacking and camping tent poles have vinyl or plastic ends on the poles - and after time these loosen up, want to come off and worse yet get lost! Well, not only does Xtreme tape fuse the tent pole ends to the pole, it also reinforces them and makes them stronger and more durable...And then the big test - my garden hose had a pin-hole leak in it, and I applied this tape to it. The key is to make sure you extend the tape on either side of the hole by a few inches (I did three inches on each side of the hole) - and then make sure you stretch the tape very well and evenly around the hose. Also, make sure the hose is on a flat surface, and try to avoid flexing / bending the hose while taping, keep it as straight as possible. Also, give it at least two windings (not just one). It is working fine, if there are any issues I will update.You get it. This stuff is amazing. Once you wind it on itself it sticks like white on rice. Its resiliency is quite good - it is very tough and it will not come unwound unless you intentionally start to pull on the seam. Then, it will rip instead of lose its contact... it is that sticky to itself.The list goes on.... like I said, I keep finding more uses for it daily.I would say just get a roll, and keep it around. You will be amazed at the number of applications this stuff will satisfy.... an easy five star!!Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GFW30UM1H2SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWROGHW#wasThisHelpful","R2GFW30UM1H2SE","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Evernew soft bottle has an edge over the Platypus soft bottles in that the cap stays attached to the bottle when you drink out of it, or fill it.  I own most every type and size of the Platypus soft sided bottles - from the 16 oz to the 2 Liter versions, including the Plus bottles!  I also own both the Push / Pull and Closure caps on the Platypus - and the issue with both is that it is possible to lose them - especially the closure cap, as when you take it off to fill or drink, it can get misplaced.  The push / pull cap at least stays on when you drink,but it has to be removed to fill it.That is where these Evernew bottles shine - the cap stays attached, and it is virtually impossible to lose it!  But there are other nice features to the Evernew bottles that make them shine over the Platy bottles IMHO.  For instance, the shock cord that is attached to the bottle - this allows you to roll up the bottle and secure it for portable storage. With the Platypus bottle, you need a rubber band, or a separate cord, or you have to supply your own shock cord (if you have it).  The shock cord coming attached to the Evernew is a nice touch.Another bonus - the Evernew bottle threads directly on to the Sawyer Mini Filter, or the Sawyer Squeeze Filter!  This means that when the crummy Sawyer bottles break (and they will), you can employ these as either your dirty reservoir, or clean reservoir. These bottles come in sizes up to 2 Liters, so if you need a bigger container, you can get one!In addition - I like the feel / durability of the Evernew bottle more than the Platypus. They stand up on their own better with liquid in them, have a stiffer feel, and for some reason they seem to dry faster than the Platypus when empty.And finally, and most importantly - these are priced well for the different sizes if you shop around. Considering I got this size for $8, and the 2 Liter size for $10, it would be tough to beat those prices for the quality you get.I would recommend these bottles to anyone looking for something compatible with Sawyer filters, or for just a standalone soft drinking bottle.Thanks for reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34LB2EHHKOZTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AQYY38#wasThisHelpful","R34LB2EHHKOZTI","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A while back, I decided to give inserts like these Superfeet a try.... my feet are getting older (I am 52) and I still like to hike, backpack, do yardwork, stay on my feet doing woodworking, etc.  Since my arches are in the low - med range, I thought the best bet would be to try the Black Superfeet as they had close to the lowest arch.  Before continuing on, realize I bought these superfeet some time ago, and I am only writing this review after trying many different insoles of different make, model and manufacture.  I am drawing my conclusions on these and other insoles after literally months of trying, testing and giving them all a fair shake.In the end, and to make a long story short, I am not a big fan of custom shoe inserts - here's why:- In my humble opinion, overall shoe inserts basically take a good fitting pair of shoes and make them too small. When I try on shoes, due to the shape of my foot and the difficulty finding shoes that fit, I tend to spend a lot of time finding the right fit.  And I don't use shoe inserts when I shoe shop, most all of us try on shoes with the stock inserts that come with the shoe. Some theories suggest to buy a shoe a 1/2 size too big to accommodate for inserts later, but I don't subscribe to that theory. Other theories suggest bringing your chosen shoe inserts with you to try on shoes, but again, I don't have a chosen insert, so that does not work.-  The superfeet have a hard plastic heel section that has sharp edges / transitions. I have four pairs of leather lined hiking and work boots, and these plastic heel sections wreaked havoc with my $350 leather lined boots in short time I used them.  I can only imagine what they would do long term.-  Even the black superfeet with the low arch was uncomfortable on my arch after an hour. I tried different sizes make sure it was putting pressure on the correct part of my arch,with the same result.  Some say you have to ""break them in"" or they take ""getting used to"" etc, etc,- but one thing I have learned about shoes over the years - if it does not feel good right when you put it on, it is not going to get better.  Period.  Your feet know very quickly if a shoe or boot is right, and even stiff boots that need breaking in still feel good when new....I read a article a while back that everyone's feet are different, and all these companies selling off the shelf, one-size-fits-all inserts in theory should not fit anyone correctly out of the box!!!  Stands to reason. And the makers who claim that there inserts are heat treatable and ""mold to your foot"".... well, I tried those, and although there was some molding, for the most part the plastic was too rigid to truly form to my foot.I have since tried many brands, types of custom insoles - I tried other Superfeet, Soles,Scholl's and more - and I am going to say it again - for my needs, all these insoles do is make a good fitting pair of shoes not fit anymore!  Your mileage may vary!THanks for reading.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG0HXMZVBVMQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XY5ZO4#wasThisHelpful","RG0HXMZVBVMQC","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I own multiples of this type of Nalgene container in the 8, 16, 32 and 64 ounce sizes.  These bottles are thick walled, heavy duty and impart absolutely zero taste to any water or beverage stored in them.  They also are easy to clean and dry quickly due to the wide mouth opening.  In addition, they are virtually leak proof with just a firm turn of the cap - I have never had anything leak out of these bottles after years of use over many different applications.  One of my bottles is about 15 years old and has seen near daily use, and other than a little yellowing of the plastic, it functions as new.I use them for anything and everything - for example, I use them for drinking water storage in my refrigerator. Where I live, I have to avoid tap water, so I have to buy / mix my drinking water (mine is a combo of mineral water, Arrowhead and RO). I also use them to store my coffee / espresso water, which is a different mix of water. Then, I use them for camping to hold juice, water and milk in my cooler.  I also use them as an ice block in the cooler itself - I fill them with water and freeze them, and combined with ice and a Yeti cooler makes a nice combination to hold ice for a long time.These bottles are worth every penny, as they are virtually indestructible and will provide years of leak proof service.  I would recommend them to anyone.Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W1YC5DPGZDU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OPJLC8#wasThisHelpful","R2W1YC5DPGZDU5","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is how this product works - the company puts an expiration date on a sticker on the back - for example, lets say Jul 2021.  Well, when the product dies two to three years later (and four to five years before the expiration date on the sticker), the product is out of warranty and the company will not honor the Jul 2021 expiration date they calculated.  And when I say the product ""dies"" I mean it is no longer usable - you try to put fresh batteries in it and it just beeps at you incessantly and constantly.The issue is MOST ALL of these die long before the touted expiration date.  Two out of two of the ones I purchased did.  And from reading all the bad reviews here, and on the internet - this is how this product is designed.  This is planned obsolescence on steroids... this product is, in my humble opinion, designed to last a couple of years intentionally.Any time you see a positive to negative review ratio so two-sided, you have to ask yourself what the real deal is with the product.  I am here to share my experience - and that experience is stay away from this product, that  is, unless you like throwing $40 at something that will die in a couple of years.Thanks for reading.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QKVOVOJ1Q03J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FGECW6#wasThisHelpful","R2QKVOVOJ1Q03J","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How did I go so many years without this stuff in my shop, or in my car, or in my backpack? Every day I think of new ways to use this stuff.... for instance, today - I was filling a small spray bottle with bug repellent for my backpack, and I was concerned about the top coming unscrewed slightly causing a potential leak. Well, I pulled out my clear version of this same tape, and wrapped it around the top where it screws on, now I am confident it will hold.Yesterday, my weedeaters foam grip was cracking splitting - out comes the black Silicone tape to the rescue to provide a new grip for the handle. The day before, my tent pole plastic end cap was not staying on the pole, again, Silicone tape to the rescue.Then, when I was weedeating my lawn,  I noticed my trusty outdoor electrical cord took a hit with either the weedeater or hedger, and had a couple of chunks of the outer sheathing missing.  I used my Xtreme tape (in the Red color to match the cord ;-)) and it has been holding for weeks and about 4 uses, I don't see why it won't hold for a very long time.Next, both my backpacking and camping tent poles have vinyl or plastic ends on the poles - and after time these loosen up, want to come off and worse yet get lost!  Well, not only does Xtreme tape fuse the tent pole ends to the pole, it also reinforces them and makes them stronger and more durable...And then the big test - my garden hose had a pin-hole leak in it, and I applied this tape to it.  The key is to make sure you extend the tape on either side of the hole by a few inches (I did three inches on each side of the hole) - and then make sure you stretch the tape very well and evenly around the hose.  Also, make sure the hose is on a flat surface, and try to avoid flexing / bending the hose while taping, keep it as straight as possible.  Also, give it at least two windings (not just one).  It is working fine, if there are any issues I will update.You get it. This stuff is amazing. Once you wind it on itself it sticks like white on rice. Its resiliency is quite good - it is very tough and it will not come unwound unless you intentionally start to pull on the seam. Then, it will rip instead of lose its contact... it is that sticky to itself.The list goes on.... like I said, I keep finding more uses for it daily.I would say just get a roll, and keep it around.

"Initially, I was impressed with these out of the box, however, after a week the first lighter I bought started noticeably sputtering.  This was not from abuse, the lighter never left my shop.  It was only used a few times to fuse some rope ends, test out a few backpacking stoves, etc...Since I bought two, I deployed the second one for duty... then, about a week later when I noticed it was running low on fuel, I attempted to fill it.  Well, to make a long story short, no matter what I tried, I could not get the lighter to accept fresh fuel... the fuel fill valve is defective.Good news is I contacted the seller and they took care of the situation, so kudos to the seller, whom I left five star rating for on Amazon.It looks as though there are many happy customers with these judging from the positive reviews here, so apparently my two for two of getting duds was an anomaly.... but it is what it is, and I call it as I see it!Thanks for reading.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26TJXWSVRC3ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8YX06I#wasThisHelpful","R26TJXWSVRC3ZT","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These bottles have done the job for me, as stated in the title, I use these for backpacking for my Picaridin bug repellent, or my Eucalyptus bug repellent.  What is nice about these bottles is they are light weight, \the top screws on tightly / securely without leaking, and the spray mist is very fine and  atomized, without drips after dispensing.Note these are made of plastic, and can break if abused or hit with a blunt object, so care is required of course.  I also put Teflon tape around the neck before screwing the cap on just for insurance of keeping the cap tight and leakproof..  I keep these stored on the outside of my pack away from my valuables in case of any issues - also they are double bagged in Ziplocs.Would recommend to anyone looking for an economical and lightweight / compact solution to dispensing with a fine mist spray pattern... these are cheap enough that if they break, just use another.Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIXXHOK8WX4HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0109V6I7S#wasThisHelpful","RIXXHOK8WX4HW","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE:  I had to dock the Mini two stars - the most recent one that I bought came in a plastic bag, with no tamper evident seals or anything on the bag. At first I thought it was the seller that was the culprit, and they repackaged in a bag - but NO - it was Sawyer!!  Sawyer is no selling these in a small ziploc bag with no factory seal or tamper evident seal!!!  To me, given the nature of this item, this is completely unacceptable and crosses the line.  If they are going to ship these in a bag, at least put a tamper seal or perferation on the bag so the user can see if the bag was opened!!  I returned the filter to the seller, and will look for one still produced in the original clamshell packaging.END UPDATEI had been using the larger Sawyer Squeeze filter for years, and recently purchased a couple of these ""Mini"" version for my most recent Backpacking trip.  I used this in my homemade gravity filter, and it performed well.  I also used it ""on the fly"" trail side to fill up a 32 oz water bottle, and it was a breeze to deploy and use.It should be noted that this is a Mini version of the Sawyer filters, and its design is intended to minimize weight - therefore, there is a trade off with this design, and the water flow through it will not be as fast as fatter / larger filters.  Stands to reason.Some things to consider when using this filter to maximize efficiency:-  If possible, pre-filter your water before putting through the mini. Putting dirty, gunky water with visible large chunks floating in it will clog the filter much faster, and result in painfully slow flow rates.  For me, this is easy - I carry an MSR Nano cloth and a small funnel in my pack, and I run the water through this to filter out the main gunk.  It works well.  You can substitute the Nano cloth with Cheesecloth folded over a few times if you want.-  If you are using this in a Gravity Filter set up, be sure and put as much distance between this and the dirty water reservoir as possible.  I use about 48 inches of hose between this filter and the dirty water bladder when it is hung  - the further that this filter can be placed / hung away from the water source, the faster the flow.  It's simple Physics - the greater the distance the greater the pressure of the water.  It becomes even more important to consider hose length given the small size of this filter.All in all, a good filter for what it is intended to do - low priced, light weight, easy to store / carry - it checks all the boxes!  It is light enough that our group carries a backup filter!Thanks for reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13AQQJLPGNAAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FA2RLX2#wasThisHelpful","R13AQQJLPGNAAE","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can I say about these filters that has not already been said?  They are a well priced, well made, high quality filter that does the job intended.How do I use these?  These help me make coffee while backpacking - and why they are a great addition to my pack is that they are lightweight, make good coffee in a very simple process, and are durable and well made where they can be used repeatedly without the need for replaceable accessories, filters or parts.For those of you relying on ""Cowboy Coffee"" while on the trail - take a long hard look at these filters.  One  option, you can pour your Cowboy Coffee through this filter and take all the grinds / grounds out of your coffee, removing the cowboy and just leaving the coffee.  Or simpler yet, just pour your grounds into this filter, then put this directly into a cup of boiling / hot water, and let it steep just like you would French press or tea.  Just don't let it steep too long, or it will be quite strong!  Experiment to the taste you prefer....One thing to note - if you don't want your coffee grounds floating to the top of the filter when you dunk it in your water - then pre-infuse your grounds with a little water before dunking.  Pre-infusion just means the act of pre-soaking the grinds, and letting them sit for 30 seconds before use.  Google pre-infusion for more details.Another note - there is a smaller version of this filter which is even better for you ultralighters out there that still want coffee on the trail!Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SH7Q7JHAAK5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WB12WK#wasThisHelpful","R3SH7Q7JHAAK5F","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you already have some of the components needed to make a gravity filter, and don't want to spend $120 on the Platypus Gravity Works retail / complete version, than this hose kit may be one of the items for you!I already had a ""Dirty"" 2L reservoir (which you can get for under $20 new if you shop), plus I already owned a couple of 2L Platypus bottles ($9.99 for these), and I already owned two Platypus Hoser bladders in the 2L and 3L sizes.  Note - I use the 2L and 3L containers for my ""Clean"" water.  This hose kit allowed me to complete the same quality and function Gravity filter that Platypus sells for over $100.So, what is the bonus I refer to in the title?  The picture, at least at the time I bought mine, does not show that you get the connector ends to hook up to a Platypus Big Zip bladder, AND the connector end to hook up to a Platypus Hoser and Platypus 2L bottle!!  The picture shows the connector that you would hook to the ""Dirty"" 2 or 4L reservoir - but does NOT show the connectors on the clean end - namely the two I mentioned that will connect to either the Big Zip, Hoser, Platypus bottes, Platypus Water Tank, etc.This is a nice kit and comes with a lot of parts for the money!

The packaging has a slide-off, thick plastic backing - and then after sliding off, there is another plastic sheet that folds back, exposing the batteries!  By contrast, the US offered Eneloops I have purchased literally come with a thin, throwaway outer shell retail package. I am not sure if this packaging is exclusive to the Japan version of the Eneloop, but I have purchased four Eneloop Pro orders from Japan based sellers, and the packaging has been identical. IMHO, the fact I got these Eneloop Pro's from Japan cheaper than I could from the US, the packaging that suffices as a storage container make these an EVEN BETTER DEAL!!!NOTE:  Not all would agree that the retail packaging would double as a battery case - I have to use a rubber band to assure it is securely closed - so don't buy these expecting to get a separate or formal case.

"You are probably wondering ""What is the difference between these Katadyn adapters being offered at $7.95, and say, the Platypus adapters being offered at $16?""  The answer - ""NOTHING!!!""  That's right.  Same with the ones offered by Sawyer for $9.... they are all basically the same part(s).In fact, I use this Katadyn set interchangeably with my Platypus Big Zip and Sawyer Filter and connector products, without any issues.  I use them in my home made gravity filter system.  Note a previous reviewer alluded to these not working with Camebak bladders - I am not sure which Camelbak bladders they were referring to, because they were not specific - but I also own a Camelbak Antidote, and these fit just fine.  The only difference was the Camelbak was blue and these were white.  (and yes, I own a lot of hydration bladders - that is what four hikers in the family will do).To make this review short and sweet, shop these adapters by best price before name, and have full confidence that they are most likely interchangeable to the other ones that look strikingly similar....

"What follows is a long-winded review, read this around bedtime if you are having trouble falling asleep! ;-) For those seeking the Reader's Digest version - overall, I think the Freiling French Press, though expensive, is the best French Press money can buy. I have tried offerings from 4-5 other French Press makers, including Espro and Bodum, and the Freiling IMHO has the highest quality build, has the best heat retention capability during the brew cycle, and will be the most durable long term due to its 100% 18/10 stainless construction - no plastic parts here!!. It is one of the very few 100% stainless French Presses you can find - plus it also a very attractive vessel to boot! I actually leave it out on my counter due to its good looks!! There are many good reasons why the Freiling French Press are the best sellers, and why reviews here on Amazon are so plentiful and positive. Amongst those reasons are quality, reliability, consistency and durability.Do realize however, that just because you spend the money and buy a Freiling will NOT guarantee you will automatically start making great coffee - as with any French Press the method is more important than the tool! You must pay attention to ALL of the variables involved in correct coffee extraction procedures - if you want the best coffee possible with a French Press, it is all about the process - assuring correct brew temperature, you use freshly ground beans, you are using an adequate grinder that grinds to consistent texture, and more!! Below I offer some tips to assuring a great cup of coffee with the Freiling, those may help in your pursuit of the perfect cup!!Just as important - do realize that the Freiling is a BREWING vessel ;-) and not a STORAGE carafe. You will see in the reviews that some complain the Freiling does not keep their coffee ""hot"" for hours - the coffee should only stay in the Freiling for around four minutes to brew, you will need a nice storage carafe to keep it hot thereafter!! Those that keep the coffee in the press with the grounds after the four minute mark are destroying the taste. Moreover, even if you transfer the coffee out, and remove the grounds and then use the Freiling as your storage vessel - you would be much better served purchasing a separate carafe to store the coffee when done. The Freiling is NOT an ideal storage carafe. (For example - I use a Zojirushi glass lined carafe for my needs).***End of Reader's Digest version - now on to the details!!Here is what I like about the Freiling Press:- Double Wall carafe construction - this is both ideal and necessary for the ever-so critical heat retention during your preheating and steeping phases. The method I employ can hold brew temps between 195 and 204 throughout the entire steeping / brewing phase, and I could never accomplish that with other presses made of glass, plastic, etc. Some have claimed that the Freiling is vacuum sealed in addition, but it is not - it is double walled and that is it. *** Note - I typically keep my brew temps around 200-202 degrees - please Google ""SCAA recommended coffee brewing temperatures"" for some background on correct temps to brew / extract coffee**- 100% 18/10 stainless - beautifully finished, but it is more than just good looks - the thick stainless assures the press will last for a long time and it will aid in heat retention already mentioned. It is durable and virtually indestructible if used with any modicum of care and not dropped daily on the tile! My 33oz Freiling is 3 years old, and it operates like the day I bought it. Plus, it still looks good also - other than a couple of minor scratches to the polished stainless exterior.- Top / Plunger assembly comes apart for thorough cleaning. You get a sense of the attention to detail and the cost it takes to make a Freiling press when you disassemble the constituent parts that make up the top / plunger. It wreaks of quality through and through... the fact it can be disassembled, and remains 100% stainless is no small feat, and a testament to the quality - and why it costs so much. Consider what it takes to be able to deliver this assembly - and why competing press makers don't!- Double walled top / lid - I already mentioned the double walled carafe - but the fact the lid is ALSO double walled construction is worth calling out- again, the competitors don't even approach this and even make their tops / lids out of PLASTIC says it all.- They are darned nice to look at! Let's face it - they are an attractive vessel.Here is what I don't like about the Freiling:- Price - this one is more of a whine ;-) and not anything wrong with the product, but hey, I can still not like it! Bottom line is I would still buy it again.. To make it less painful, I got this 44oz version for $98 here on Amazon - it was in my cart for over a year in the $125 range, and when I saw the price drop temporarily I jumped on it!- The top on my 33oz version had a weld seam failure around the hole where the plunger is inserted - causing the top to fill with water that I could not get back out. HOWEVER, Freiling sent me a new top when I asked with no hassle... it was a ""one-off"" problem and don't expect it to happen on my other Freilings.- I can't think of anything of substance I DON'T like about the Freiling - if you learn how to use it, perfect your method then this is the top of the heap when it comes to French Press. It is the best tool for the Press job IMHO.In addition to this 44oz Freiling Stainless Press, I have owned the 33 oz Freiling Stainless Press for a few years and have used it almost daily to make my morning coffee (except for the once a week I use my Technivorm drip brewer). Therefore, I do have experience with Freiling's presses, and understand how to best utilize them to squeeze out the optimal cup of coffee. So, why did I buy the 44oz Freiling when I already own the 33oz? For one, that extra cup on some days makes a difference ;-) and second I think the Freilings are cool, have grown attached to them and see absolutely nothing wrong with owning two different sizes!! Lol. So there it is...Finally, some pointers / things to think about as you pursue the ""perfect"" cup of coffee:- Make sure and pre-heat your Press and storage carafe in advance - don't put your coffee / boiling water into a cold French Press; and don't put your finished product in a cold storage carafe!!! (google it, this affects the taste). At a minimum, use hot tap water to pre-heat, which usually gets to 130-140 degrees. Personally, I use boiling water to pre-heat - you can boil it on the stove, or perhaps use something like a Zojirushi hot water kettle / boiler that is ready in advance when you wake!- Use fresh beans, and grind the beans right before use. Coffee beans are best within two weeks of roasting, and most store bought beans can be MANY weeks old by the time you buy them. If you can find a local source for your beans that are fresh, do it. You will notice a marked improvement in your finished product.- Buy a decent quality grinder. The $20 blade grinders are just not good enough for French Press - it needs a consistent, coarse grind. At a minimum, I recommend a Capresso Infinity for around $70, then use the ""Coarse"" settings, dialing it in to where you eliminate 95% of the sludge in your cup. I use an Orphan Espresso LIDO hand grinder ($150), and alternate that with a Capresso Infinity. You can also get a Baratza Virtuoso if you want to spend more! The grind is CRITICAL - it needs to be the correct coarseness - but more importantly needs to be CONSISTENT. Consistency is the main challenge for most cheap grinders on the market.- Assure your steeping / brewing temperatures are in the 195-204 degree range. This is not my own recommendation, this is the ""proven"" range for the best coffee extraction. Invest in something like a Thermapen, or a cheaper temperature probe, that allows you to test the water temperature while steeping. Another critical step to success. For my brewing, I stay in the 200-202 range typically during the four minute brew cycle. *** Note - please Google ""SCAA recommended coffee brewing temperatures"" for some background on correct temps to brew / extract coffee**- Depress the plunger SLOWLY when it is time, doing it too fast will cause sediment. Also, if the plunger seems to get ""stuck"", lift it ever so slightly, then depress again!- Fill the water level BELOW the spout depression / line in the carafe when filling for brewing / steeping. This will help guarantee less grounds in your finished product.To summarize - now that you have spent the $$ on a top of the line French Press, consider getting a good grinder that can consistently grind on a coarse setting without a lot of ""fines"" in the grind; considerr purchasing a good temperature probe (like a Thermapen to check your temperatures of different components throughout the process to find what needs tweaking; consider getting fresh coffee beans. This will give you an even better cup in the end... also, search the web for you tube videos, etc on different processes, find out what works best for you. Once you experience a ""perfectly"" executed cup of press coffee, you will be hooked!! ;-)Thanks for reading, and best of luck in your choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ECDA71GD4O1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002M3I8IO#wasThisHelpful","R1ECDA71GD4O1Y","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this knife (actually bought two) for my sons' to side carry on our camping / backpacking trips.  I got tired of them always lacking a cutting implement when needed, and tried to find something idiot-proof (and cheap) that was sharp, and was easy to re-sharpen when required.  (btw, I didn't just call my boys idiots, did I??  :-))  Actually, this knife is *better* than something easy to re-sharpen - if the blade gets a bad knick or gets dull, just swap it out for a new blade!  Plus, believe it or not, these blades are VERY sharp, and hold their edge fairly well!I own a number of high end knives (Spydercos, Kabars, Multitools), and I am not going to claim this knife is made to the same quality and standard.  However, when I saw this knife, handled it, cut with it, felt the weight / balance - I was impressed for all this knife gives you in a $30 package.  There is a reason hunters carry this knife for skinning game - it is a very sharp, well built knife with replaceable blades so you don't have to be overly careful.In summary - I am pleasantly surprised at what this knife is for the price, and would readily recommend to anyone as long as your expectations match what you are getting.  This is NOT an heirloom quality knife, however, it is a very serviceable knife that is sharp and immediately resharpens itself when need with the replaceable blades. Oh, did I mention that the replacement blades are very cheap?  It already comes with six blades, but if that is not enough and you detest sharpening, just buy more, they are priced as throw away commodities.Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHO9F8XBAY9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AB969S2#wasThisHelpful","R3GHO9F8XBAY9G","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this reel as a ultra light weight option for backpacking - so one of my main objectives was to minimize weight, while maintaining quality at a sub $50 price point.  After doing a little research, I found there are some reels that are lighter - but not by much.  And some of those were MUCH more expensive.  The Pflueger President is known for decent quality at a good price, and this one is no exception!This specs on this one says it weighs 5.9oz, it weighed in at 6.1 oz - so close enough!  I put 4 lb line on it, that should give me enough to catch decent size trout.  I am going to pair this with a St Croix Triumph, UL 5 ft rod that breaks down into four pieces.  This makes a pretty nice combo!Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good quality reel at a good price - of course there are better reels out there, but the Pflueger President has a good reputation of balancing quality and price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TWCU8FTSB6BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OU1BOK#wasThisHelpful","R1TWCU8FTSB6BA","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Believe the reviews and the hype about the Para MiIitary 2 --- the size, weight, feel and blade quality of this knife have made it an EDC classic!  I had considered purchasing this knife for a few years before finally taking the plunge - now,  I have been EDC'ing this knife since the day it arrived, and it is one fine knife that holds a keen edge, and holds it very well.  I am really beginning to appreciate the S30V steel on the PM 2.  S30V it is a very high quality knife steel!I own three other Spyderco's - the Police Stainless, a Delica FRN and a Lil' Matriarch - and all have a lot of use between home, work, camping, hiking, backpacking, etc.  But, the next backpacking trip will have this knife at my side, I enjoy the size and action of this knife a lot.  It is very light for its size at 3.8 oz, and it has a very good feeling in the hand with the G10 handle.  The balance is very good and most importantly it cuts like a dream.  The locking mechanism has a good ""snap"" to it when opening, and it has just the right amount of stiffness on the action where it opens very smoothly.Owning the Delica with a 3"" blade and the Police with the 4"" blade makes me realize how perfect the 3.5"" blade of the PM 2 is for my hand size.  The Delica always felt a little small and I carried mainly for its light weight.... likewise, the Police always felt a tad big, and heavy due to the all stainless construction.  Then again, the Police was never an EDC for these reasons, I typically keep that for around the house duties.I am not a big fan of the blade release / locking mechanism on the PM 2, but that is a minor concern and does not even come close to outweighing all the positives about this knife.I liked this knife so much that I also ordered the Camo with the black blade - it is backordered and may take a few months to get it - but it will be worth the wait.  I look forward to passing these knives on to my sons' some day....I highly recommend this knife..... Thanks for reading.EDIT:  For those concerned about the number of ParaMilitary 2 fakes floating around out there, I thought I would add a few sentences...First, the knife I purchased was sold / shipped by Amazon directly, and arrived with the box taped on both ends.  This gave me initial cause for concern, as the Spyderco factory does NOT tape the box (I called Spyderco and they verified that).  I still have not found who taped the box, whether it is Amazon, or perhaps a 3rd party that might be supplying Amazon (note again, I called Spyderco directly, and they stated definitively they do NOT tape the boxes).  Also, even though my first box was taped shut, the knife had definitely been used and handled previously - perhaps a return?  I called Amazon, expressed my concern, and they sent a replacement out - which was brand new, never used.  However, the box on the replacement was also taped... so my guess is Amazon is taping the boxes shut.  The tape job is professional, uses rounded corners and is well done, but just a heads up.Next - as far as real vs fake - I spent a lot of time checking the knife I received from Amazon (both of them) and I am 100% confident that these are authentic.  I checked all the known issues with the fakes, and none of them exist here.... this is an authentic Spyderco, so at the time of writing this, the current stock sold by Amazon looks good.  Just don't be alarmed if your box arrives taped on both ends... both of the PM2's I purchased Fulfilled by Amazon were taped on both ends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32SEN9POATDC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VZVI88#wasThisHelpful","R32SEN9POATDC1","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a headlamp that has high lumens, is ultra-bright and can light up the night, look elsewhere - this e+LITE is NOT a power house.  However, if you are looking for a headlamp that is ultra-LIGHT, can provide task lighting for your immediate vicinity, and make sure you can navigate in dark environments, than this is worth a look.I bought this headlamp solely for backpacking, and the purpose was to save weight.  I own many headlamps currently - like a Spot 90 and 130, multiple Petzl TakTikka and Tikka-whatevers, and more... and own many high lumen, light weight flashlights - and they all have specific purposes.  But when I am looking for something that bridges the gap between lightweight and brightness, I put this in my pack.  My other headlamps are 3+ ounces, or 200% heavier than this one... sure they are brighter, but to me, the trade off from brightness to usability has a different requirement when I have to carry all my equipment on my back.  Plus, when I backpack, I typically carry TWO lights so I have a backup - and the backup light is a handheld light (usually LED and lightweight) that provides more lumens when required.I use this primarily for around-camp tasks at night where I want hands free operation, and inside my tent at night for the same reason.  When in the backcountry, it is amazing how much more important hands-free operation becomes, and how much more frequently the requirement arises.  This light is rated at a max of 29 lumens - and that is PLENTY of light for tasks at night.  In fact, I prefer to save my night vision as much as possible, so I actually use the lower lumen settings more on this lamp - and that doubles in benefit as it saves battery!Another nice feature of this headlamp is the run time duration on the same battery.  Due to its lower output / lumen requirement, it runs for a long time on one battery.  Plus, you can literally leave the same battery in the device for years (according to the specs) and it will not drain the battery if the device is not used.  Not all devices can do that, there is always some sort of drain that kills the battery.  Also, even if you have to carry extra batteries, this utilizes the button type 2032 battery, so replacements weight next to nothing and carrying extras is not a big deal.  (as opposed to AA and AAA batteries which by comparison are heavy)Other advantages of this device for backpackers - this device is highly water resistant, and claims to be waterproof to 1m.  It also has a red light feature to further preserve night vision (nice feature for astronomy, which I also do).  Finally, the headband on this is intentionally low profile and light - it is really just a nylon string - but it is comfortable, does not exert too much pressure, and you can wear it for long periods and not know you have it on.  You have to realize the headband is where many devices get most of their weight from, so a lot of the weight savings comes from minimizing that.Overall, I would recommend this light if it meets your requirements of something that is lightweight, offers sufficient task lighting, is water resistant and durable and has a good battery life.  I liked it so much, I bought two more for my sons, who also backpack with me!!Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLO07DKKQCM2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AUBOTS#wasThisHelpful","RLO07DKKQCM2P","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already own two utility carts - both two shelf models - and I was hoping this three shelf model was going to be a welcome addition to my workshop.  Wow, was I wrong.  After briefly attempting to assemble this Luxor cart, and encountering what I thought was a poorly manufactured cart due to poor part quality and fit tolerances, I then went back and read some of the reviews to see if anyone else had the issues I did. I found one reviewer touched on the lack of sturdiness of the shelves and the build quality - but nobody touched on the fact that the leg posts do not fit into the shelf posts!!!  Huh?  Did they change the design of the parts recently?  DId I get a lemon?  How could I be one of the very few to encounter this?First, a little about the two carts I already own - one is a WEN model, two shelf cart and one is a Husky cart, which is also a two shelf model.  These both were purchased from Home Depot - the WEN for $69 on sale (normally $99) and the Husky for $89.  The WEN cart looks exactly like the Harbor Freight $99 cart - and after further inspection I found out it is... although it is not a bad cart - I like it better than the HD Husky cart.  The main thing I do not like about the two Home Depot carts - only two swivel casters and NO locking casters - which is a pain in the rear on my sloped patio as I constantly battle the loaded cart toodling down the slope....So you can see from the two carts I already own that my expectations were not through the roof - the two carts I own are sub-$100 carts, and I look for something that is built sturdy that does not carry a high price tag.  It is not like I was comparing this cart to $500 carts that are made of stainless steel - I weighing my inputs against two HD carts that I got for $69 and $89 respectively, and carts made of plastic.  Keep that in mind when reading here - this is NOT my first cart, and my expectations were NOT too high.  Also, this review is only my opinion, others may beg to differ, and I respect that.Now, back to this Luxor cart.  Upon opening the box, the first thing that struck me was the ""thinness"" of the shelves.  Compared to the two other less expensive carts I own, the shelves are a lot thinner, and flexed with the slightest side pressure.  OK... I initially did not fret.  I was still looking forward to the fact I had four swivel casters, two that locked.  Well, I never got that far.  When I turned the first shelf over to install the posts, I was horrified first at the thin leg post material, and the cheapness of the plastic used.  They are square / channel designed legs, but made of VERY thin plastic, and very brittle plastic in addition - in my opinion.  But that was not the worst part - what was the real head scratcher was THEY DID NOT FIT INTO THE SHELF posts. I played with three or four of the legs posts on three or four different shelf posts, to no avail.  To make the leg posts fit, I would have had to file down the shelf post part... or force them on with a mallet, which would damage the receiving part of the shelf, and gouge out the plastic.  I refused to do that 16 times for the 8 shelf posts!!!!  They should fit, and if there was a concern about them being too loose, they should have designed them with a screw, or nut and bolt system!! If I attempted to force the legs on, it would peel back pieces of the shelf post, and I did not want to go any further.Note that this cart is designed with ZERO screws, bolts, nuts, etc.  NONE.  On one hand some might like that, but with this cart and the way it turned out, even if I did want to keep this cart, that was a minus.  Given the cheapness of the plastic used on the leg posts, there could be nothing but problems down the road.  The thinness of the leg posts, and the cheapness of the plastic simply does not add up to making a press fit design.  This cart is simply NOT made to last.At this point, I have described enough to paint the picture of my thoughts on this cart.  I never went past Step 3 on assembly.  I will stick with carts that are designed with thicker / beefier / sturdier parts, and ones that employ screw, nut and bolt hardware to hold it together.  I cannot believe this cart was more expensive than the two I already own...As a side note, when I went back to HomeDepot.com, I noticed a three shelf cart under the label ""H Wilson"" that was the EXACT same cart as this one - the picture was the exact stock picture, with the same specs.  HomeDepot wanted $129 for this same cart... so obviously this cart is made in one factory, then marketed by more than one brand / company with different labels.  Says a lot to me.  I know that most carts are mass produced these days, but I will stick with the ones that are better built for my needs.The pictures, description and reviews fooled me on this cart - what I thought I was getting and what I got did not match in quality in the end.  I am shocked at all the positive reviews for this cart... but again everyone's needs are different, YMMV, and I respect your assessment of this cart could be different.  Please return that sentiment....Thanks for reading.EDIT:  I did not mention this in my review above, but I did return this cart, and labeled it as ""defective"" since I could not get the leg posts to mate with the shelf standards without damaging the part or doing some major filing / modification.EDIT 2:::  After reading other reviews - some that say how easy this cart assembled - I have to assume that the company changed the design of the cart, as the one I received did not go together easy at all - not even close.  I am a woodworker, an engineer and work with my hands all the time.  What follows is not a review written by someone who rarely assembles things, quite the contrary.  But I had to write the review for the product I received, and call it honestly.  I know some may not like that, but it is what it is...... if the company has since addressed this design / assemble issue, then that is a good thing.  And if my review had anything thing to do with that, then that is also a good thing.  But if the reviews written before mine that state how easy this cart assembles are true, then the only conclusion I can come up with is a design change somewhere along the way.END EDIT:::","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNOL6IRI5CSPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJUZY8Y#wasThisHelpful","RNOL6IRI5CSPS","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I only recently discovered the Turtle Fur Backcountry Bandana - I saw one at a local Sportsman Warehouse (the discontinued Ultra Lightweight ""Gone Fishin"" model) and liked the size, look and feel - so I bought it!  I then saw the Light Weight ""Digi"" pattern / model here on Amazon for a reduced price, so I bought it also.The ""Lightweight"" model reviewed here is made up of 92% Poly and 8% Spandex. The  ""Ultra Light"" model I also own is 83% Poly and 17% Lycra. You are probably thinking that since one is called ""Light"" and the other is called ""Ultra Light"" that there would be a marked difference in weight - quite the contrary actually - the Light version weighs 58.5 grams and the Ultra Light version weighed in at 58 grams!! I got a good chuckle when I saw that the difference in weight is only a half of a gram.Regardless of the weight, I like both of these bandanas a lot. Among other uses - I use these as a neck / side of the face cover under my Tilley and other hats - I drape them over my head and wear them under my hat. I was using cotton bandanas for this same purpose, but these are far better for four main reasons: - these are larger than the cotton bandanas - most of my cotton bandanas are 19 x19 inches, and these are 20.5 x 20.5 inches. This extra inch and a half makes a big difference in covering the side / back of my neck. - these wick water away and dry much faster than my cotton bandanas - they cotton stays too wet and my hat stays wet and stains as a result. With these, my hat is dry in most cases due to the wicking. Sometimes on hotter days I like the wetter cotton, so I do still use them on occasion. - these are much softer and more comfortable on my head / skin than the rougher cotton.

"In the past I have used Harper Palymyra Deck Scrubs in a similar size - but when I had trouble locating a Harper this time for the right price, I decided to give this one a try.  I was able to get this Weiler for just over $5 here on Amazon, where the Harper of similar size I could not find under $10.The quality of this brush is very good - not quite on par with the Harper version, but for the money it is good enough and I would have no trouble recommending it.  The bristles are well mounted, and don't fall out readily like so many other cheaply made palmyras;  plus, the wood block is well made and sturdy, and should last as long as the brush does at least.This brush has two connectors - one threaded (standard size, all my handles fit) and a tapered one also - which also fits the handles I own so I would say the size is fairly standard.I used this on my cool deck and rough concrete and they worked very well - the bristles were the right stiffness and held up well when scrubbing.  Many times, cheaper palmyra bristles are weak and will bend / flex too much when scrubbing, resulting in the bristles not penetrating well into the grooves and rougher surfaces.  The Weiler bristles are a good stiffness.Again, it is not quite the same level / quality of the Harper equivalent, but for half the price I am satisfied.

"This is my second pair of Danner Instigators, with my last pair purchased back in 2007.  What I like most about these is they are pretty much the same boot eight years later - there are not many changes to the design, the last, and the build quality after all these years.  Many shoes suffer from the ""declining quality"" syndrome, where they get good reviews, then are summarily cheapened in later revisions.  Not these, and many other Danners, the build remains consistent over the years.Now, these boots are not made in the US like some other Danner lines, and they are not their top of the line shoe.  I own MANY shoes, and I purchase this particular one for a work shoe, and like it the ""price to comfort to value"" ratio.  I got this pair for $114 after Amazon price fluctuations, and for that price it hits the sweet spot for me.  I do NOT use these for hiking - again, I use them as a work shoe around the house (in the woodshop, painting, yard work, washing the car etc, etc).  I have other high quality outdoor / hiking shoes for th the outdoor endeavors, and don't look to the Danners for that.As far as the fit - I typically wear a 12.5 to 13 wide in other shoes, and the Danner 12W fits.  If Danner made a 12.5 Wide, I would get that, but the next size up is a 13 and that is too big for me. What I like about the Danner for someone with wide feet - the sides of the shoe below the toe box and into the forefoot is soft leather, and will form to your feet.  This allows my wide feet to push the side of the shoe out to where it needs to be, and there are not protrusions or plastic inserts in the Danner to push back or fight that side formation.As far as waterproof performance - like all leather / Goretex shoes it takes maintenance to keep your leather soft, supple and conditioned - and more importantly to keep top waterproof performance.  For this shoe - when it is new, I immediately condition the leather with Nikwax Leather conditioner, then wear the shoe wet to help with initial break in and leather formation to my foot.  Then, I periodically apply Nikwax Waterproofing Wax for Leather (and some left over Nikwax Aqueous) when I notice the water not beading up and penetrating the leather too quickly.  Then, every four to six months, another Conditioner step to keep the leather rich and soft.For my foot, this shoe is a good trade off for price, quality, comfort for an around the house work shoe.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good work shoe, and seeing how I got eight years of periodic use out of the last pair, that is good enough for me.  Note that when I do wear them, it is for long periods and for heavy duty work.  For instance, I can put 4 days straight in the woodshop for 10-12 hours a day, be on an outdoor painting project, driveway project for days on end, etc.  So, these shoes by no means have been treated lightly, and the 8 years of use is a good indicator of build quality.Thanks for reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W5VCIXGIWRME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NE5REW#wasThisHelpful","R2W5VCIXGIWRME","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I saw Osprey's new Rev 18 and 24 packs, I was intrigued.  I was initially impressed how the pack wore easily in the store - and thought it was worth a closer look.  I liked what Osprey was trying to target with this pack, and it is about time they recognized the gap in their current lineup!!  Another big plus was how feature rich the Rev 18 and 24 packs are - here is a summary of the features and my opinion on how they stack up:- Large hip / waist belt pockets - ALWAYS a nice feature in a day pack - and these are done right!  First, there are TWO and not just one, and second they are LARGE enough to put a camera, your keys, snack bars and still have room for a compass!!  Very nice.  They are also VERY easy to access and zip / unzip which is a plus.- Easy access / zippered and separate water hydration compartment - amazingly, the hydration compartment is done right.  I say ""amazingly"" because so many packs are not well thought out in the hydration area.  The Rev 18 is an easy access, zippered compartment with a tailored Osprey bladder that is wide and flat - not a big bulbous mass like some other bladders.  The compartment can be accessed without emptying the pack, and most of all can be filled WITHOUT removing the bladder from the pack!!!  That is a VERY nice feature.- Baffled hydration bladder - the Osprey bladder, as mentioned, is wide and flatter in design than some other bladders - and most importantly incorporates a baffled design so the water ""sloshing"" around is minimized.  I noticed this right away and appreciate the attempt.  I also like the way the bladder hangs in the hydration compartment - very sturdy and stable way to mount the bladder.  Most packs just give a loop / hook, this pack gives a structural cross - beam to hold the bladder at its strongest point.- Easy access, large water bottle pockets - I am VERY impressed by the accessibility of these pockets.  These pockets are angled toward the back so you can easily reach around and get your water, binos, or whatever you want to store in them.  Very well thought out design, and I really appreciate the easy access.- TWO pockets on the shoulder straps - and one of the pockets is big enough for your cell phone or GPS!!! Very nice touch.  Plus, this pocket is waterproof , which is also a big plus!! The other pocket is the standard smaller sized pocket, and you can put your iPod, or whatever else you want in there.  The second pocket is NOT waterproof.- Separate, easy access smaller gear compartment - the stuff pocket is well placed and easy to get to - I wish it were just a tad bigger and had a zippered mesh pocket in it, but it is adequate.- Large, easy-in, easy-out main gear compartment - that says it all, the main gear compartment is no frills, just a large space to put your stuff.  No mesh zipper pockets inside, just a large space that you can organize the way you want it.  I don't mind this, as if I need to segregate things, I just use my own mesh bag or Ziploc or whatever works.- External bungee cord storage on the front for jackets, wet gear, etc.  This is always a plus - I like the exposed bungee system more than a pocket style external pocket for wet gear.- There are more nice touches also - like the magnetic water hose mount on your sternum strap, and the fact you can position it close to your pie hole.  Also, there are two sternum straps, not just one, and I like the fact I can use the bottom one to steady my binos so they are not bouncing around.With all the features mentioned, what do I like BEST about the pack??? THE FIT!!!!  I have used this pack on four hikes now - anywhere from 5 to 10 mile hikes - and this pack just melts into your frame, and you don't even know you have it on.  It literally fits like a vest.  I am 6'3"" tall with around a 20"" torso, and the pack fits comfortably in all the right places.  It does wear a tad warm as it is a close to the back fit - but that is by design and one  of the trades offs of a pack that fits close to your frame.I like this pack so much, I am considering getting another for my sons' - they have picked up on my satisfaction with this pack, and they really like the cell phone and iPod pocket potential, plus the easy access hip and water bottle pockets.In summary - this pack nails the triad of convenience, comfort, and feature richness- and not just for the day hiker, but also for a scrambler - it hugs your frame and is perfect for either activity.  Would I recommend for a marathoner or trail runner?  Marginally, as at 18L it is a little larger and maybe not ideal... depends on your needs.  There is also a Rev 12 and a Rev 6 that might be better for runners.I would unequivocally recommend this pack to anyone - and normally would quality the ""if it fit"" moniker - but with this pack, due to its flexible / vest design, also long as the torso is long enough, it will fit more people than not.  It is not like a frame pack where there is a limiting factor to fit.Thanks for reading.Note - I own a LOT of day packs of different sizes and make, and each have their own place in my families hiking regimen.  My wife and two sons also hike, so that contributes to the justification to try / own many different packs.  Currently, some of the daypacks I use are - Talon 5.5, 11 and 22, and also own Talon 4 and Talon 8 hip packs that see use.  (we like the Talon series :-)) We also have a couple of Go-Lite packs for fast, light hikes and scrambling, and a couple of Camel back ""bladder only"" type packs for biking and short hikes.  For long day hikes we also use Deuter 30 or 32, Osprey Stratos 24, among other packs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KPMXKZZKEM46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E0LH0D0#wasThisHelpful","R3KPMXKZZKEM46","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before discussing the quality build / construction of the Pamir, let me say it - these boots just look sexy!  Every time I wear these boots, I get questions like ""... what kind of boots are those?""  and ""...where did you get them?""  Then it usually goes something like ""those are nice looking boots!"" Most people have not had exposure to the Pamirs, and most will never buy them due to their size / weight and the fact they don't have GoreTex.  Well, I gotta say, it's their loss.  Most hiking boot buyers have been brainwashed to think GoreTex HAS to be part of the boot, or it is not waterproof.  The first mistake with that thinking is that GoreTex is waterPROOF - it is merely water resistant. What most don't know is that a high quality, thick leather boot can also be highly water resistant if you maintain it.  (what do you think folks did many years ago before GoreTex?)Next, most buyers of packing / hiking boots are being inundated with the notion that backpacking boots need to be ""light"" - really?  The marketing / sales push for lightweight, high margin and ""temporary"" shoes has put a lot of pressure on the tried and tested hiking / packing boot, and has led many to believe that they can carry 40 lbs with lightweight slippers on... until they try it and limp into camp with sore feet.  Let's be sensible and separate marketing and sales from carrying 40-50 lbs for 10 miles over rock terrain before buying those trail runners for backpacking.I have owned a pair of Pamirs for going on three years now, and currently shopping for my second pair.  These are simply well built, high quality boots that I don't mind using for even day hiking.  I just enjoy wearing them!  OK, they are definitely overkill for most of my day hikes - but sometimes I take hikes through mud, rocks, bushes and that is where these shine.  I just enjoy wearing these boots!The leather interiors are just simply exquisite - it is top quality leather and really holds up well.  La Sportiva recommends maintaining the interiors with Lexol leather conditioner - and it works well.  I use both the Lexol Cleaner and Conditioner to maintain the interiors, and do this every few months, or when I notice the leather starting to look dirty or getting to dry.The exteriors are just plain built like tanks!  The rand is very tough, and has never come unglued from the leather.  The Vibram soles can take a beating and have held up after hundreds of miles over every type of terrain.  The Perwanger leather exterior is VERY thick, and very durable.  And with proper treatment, can hold back water VERY well.  Again, the boots are not waterproof, but then again, no shoes really are unless they are made of rubber!  I own GoreTex boots also - namely the Zamberlan Vioz Plus, Salomon Quest.  I also own a Kayland Contact with Event lining - and two other leather lined boots - Lowa Renegade and Trekker.  Comparing the water resistance to the GoreTex and Event lined shoes, the Pamirs perform on par with these.  Plus, the GoreTex seems to dry slower once they get wet.  (The Lowa leather lined shoes do not perform well in water).  The biggest advantage is I find leather interiors breathe better than GoreTex boots, especially in the warmer climates...Note that La Sportiva recommends Nikwax Waterproofing for Leather (formerly Aqueous Wax) for maintaining the Perwanger leather exteriors.  I found it works well if used correctly.  I still have some Nikwax Aqueous Wax left over before they changed the name to Nikwax Waterproofing, and I find it works very well.  Realize the Nikwax Waterproofing for Leather used to be called Nikwax Aqueous - Nikwax claims it was just a name change, and the formula is the same, but I am skeptical and still like the older Aqueous better.  I also use the Nikwax Leather Conditioner once a year when the leather starts to dry out.Bottom line - if you like heavy backpacking / mountaineering boots, don't require Gore Tex, and the Pamirs fit you foot type - I would recommend giving them a try.  They are top quality, hand made Italian boots that look sexy too!!Thanks for reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZ2GIEK6694H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RF2EJO#wasThisHelpful","R3TZ2GIEK6694H","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Salomon changed the design / cut of the Quest 2 in some key areas that resulted in the shoe not being as ideal for my feet as the Quest 1's were... these changes probably won't affect many with ""normal"" feet, but if curious please read on.Please understand that I absolutely LOVE the Salomon Quest line (and other shoes by Salomon), so my observations about liking the older version more than the newer version does NOT mean the Quest 2 is a bad choice - quite the contrary, it is still a wonderful shoe as the other reviews will clearly attest also.  It is just not the same for MY particular foot anymore, nothing like the first Salomon Quests released in 2010 (which were ideal for my foot).Additionally, for those that were not aware - Salomon is now offering a ""Forces"" line for some of their shoes - which include the Quest as an option.  This ""Forces"" offerings are a tactical / military version of certain ""chosen"" Salomon shoes - and interestingly the Forces Quest is based on the Quest 1 (the older model) and not the Quest 2.  This may change at a later date, but as of this review the Forces Quests are based on the Quest 1.  These shoes are all Black or Navajo in color - AND come in a Non-GoreTex version as well as the GoreTex.  Check out TacticalGear.com or USElite.com - very cool shoes, and a great choice for those like me that still like the Quest 1 better.Now onto more details .....  First - I have owned Salomon Quest's since they came out with ""Version 1"" a few years back and bought my first pair in 2010.  I have since owned two pairs, and when I went to purchase another pair a few weeks back, I was surprised to discover there was now a Version 2 out.  I had not paid close attention to the Salomon new releases and only found out about the newer version recently.Second - my son wears Salomon Quests also, and my other son is on his 3rd pair of Salomon Comets (the Quests little brother).  And to pile on even further, one of my boys wear Salomon XA shoes as his every day shoe to school.... and my wife has a pair of Salomon trail runners!  So let's just say our family has logged a fair amount of miles on Salomon Quests and Comets,  plus their other offerings.The biggest reason I opted for the Version 1 Quest is they were renowned to fit people with ""hard to fit"" feet like mine very well - wide in the toebox, low volume in the forefoot, and a thin low volume heel. (think duck foot but not yellow!).  The Version 1 was cut tight across the forefoot, had a tight heel cup and the side and toebox taper / flare was perfect for a wide foot.  Most of all, the area over the forefoot and toebox was not overly elevated and cut tight, meaning those with thin feet did not have a bunch of extra / unneeded room.Version 2 is a fine shoe...no doubt.  But they are definitely cut differently, and some of the features in Version 1 have changed in Version 2 that changed the game for me, and have resulted in me opting out of the new Quest 2.  Most won't really care or notice these changes, but those who targeted Version 1 due to hard to fit feet might be disappointed.  The biggest change has to do with the volume increase over the forefoot and over the toebox.  The Version 2 is cut higher and simply has increased the volume in those areas significantly.  If you put the two Versions side by side, it is easy to see this.  The Quest 2 is just ""taller"" than the Quest 1.  Next, the cut of the area on the outside edge just below the toe box has a more narrow / aggressive slope, meaning those with wider feet may find the Quest 2 tighter and uncomfortable on the outside edge below the baby toe.In actuality, these changes probably mean they will fit MORE people and result in more people with normal feet (unlike me) to fit into the shoes - so from a business perspective, it was probably a smart move by Salomon.  But for me, I have already begun my search for the older version, and plan on buying an extra pair or two of the Quest 1 to put away since the fit me so well.  Again, the Quest 2 is a fine shoe, and carried forward the great quality and reputation from the Quest 1 - but the changes were enough to make me look elsewhere.Hope this helps one or two folks who may have purchased the Quest 1 for the same reason I did! -)  I would still recommend Salomon Quests to anyone that they fit correctly.In closing, just wanted to add I mostly use the Salomon Quests for day hiking, or in situations where I am not carrying more than 25 lbs in my pack - my legs / feet are older and I prefer a heavier / sturdier shoes for the heavier loads, but for younger legs the Quests could be fine for heavier loads.  I know of some that use the Quests for heavier loads.  I also have no issues using the Quests on rocky / rugged trails, they perform well on smooth and rough trails.  The only thing they don't get a passing grade on is cactus spines - I have had one or two find its way in due to the softer sides.Oh, one more thing - there is a good news / bad news ending here - my son, who does not suffer from the duck foot problem I do - actually likes the fit of the Quest 2 MORE than the Quest 1, and wants to buy a pair!!  So even in our family there is a split decision on the Quest 2.  But as I already said.... it is still a fine shoe.Thanks for reading!UPDATE 4/10/2015:  I purchased a pair of Salomon Quest 4d Forces GTX from USElite (Navajo in color) - which are modeled after the Quest 1's.  For me, it is a keeper, it checks all the boxes, and seems to fit like the earlier, 2011 version of the Quest 1.  (the later versions of the Quest 1 were cut more like the Quest 2 than the earlier Quest 1).  I wanted black, but for some reason the GTX version in black goes 12 to 13 with NO 12.5 offered (that may change) so I got the Navajo - and you know what, the color has grown on me... I like it!I also tried the Non-GTX version of the Quest Forces, but for my foot, tastes, there was something about the non-GTX version that just felt off... I returned them.  Still a great choice for those seeking a non GTX version.  Note also that opposite of the GTX version - the Non GTX DOES come in 12.5 in black, but NOT in Navajo.Additionally, I found a pair of Quest 12.5's online in the Audobahn / Black / Flea - got them for $160 and they are on the shelf for my son for later this year when he wears out his current pair.  With these, I am going to make the last stand on Quest 1's and see where it goes from here.... still hoping Salomon returns to the cut design of the Quest 1 from early 2011 / 2012 timeframe (with the beefier tongue, leather, slimmer cut, etc)... but doubt that will ever happen and sure those are history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ID7I6WJ1DMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWK40MC#wasThisHelpful","R13ID7I6WJ1DMI","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Salomon made a winner with this boot - it is one of the few boots that is durable enough for light backpacking, yet light enough to use for day hiking also - plus it has a Gore Tex lining to make them high water resistant.  And oh, did I mention they are also a very comfortable boot?  (assuming they fit your foot type).How are these boots cut, and how do they fit?  First off, my foot type -  have a thin foot in girth, wider in the toe box with the widest point under my baby toe.  Plus, my forefoot is narrow and I have a thin / low volume heel.  For my foot type, shoes are hard to find, especially hiking boots.  For me, if the shoe fits in the toe box, it might be too wide in the forefoot, or my heel slips because it is so thin.These boots are cut perfectly for my foot type, and they lock on tightly to my heel.  They are probably the best fitting hiking boot I have ever owned.  If your foot is wide in the forefoot, or thick in or over the arch, or you have a high volume heel - this boot make not be the best for you.  These narrow considerably in the forefoot, and if your forefoot is wide, these will be uncomfortable IMHO.Moreover - if you like to put custom footbeds, orthopedic inserts, etc into your boots - forget it with these boots... you have to see them to understand why, but these were simply not made to accommodate even the thinner custom footbeds or inserts.  If the footbed is very thin and cut just right, maybe - but again footbeds are not ideal in these boots.I like these so much I wear them for yard work at home also, in addition to hiking.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat - five stars for this buyer!!Thanks for reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C6F0IVGC4V15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002V34BW2#wasThisHelpful","R3C6F0IVGC4V15","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before purchasing this mouse, I was using the Logitech V380 Bluetooth / Wireless mouse for about three years.  The V380 started acting funny, so it was time to look for a new one!  Well, when I searched on ""Bluetooth"" mice, it appears the choices have narrowed over the last few years, and the USB mice have become the better quality / lower cost option.After looking around, it was clear the Logitch M325's rated well, and that they were a top seller.  Based on this fact alone, I thought I would give one a try.  The only thing left was - what color??? ;-)  I usually don't fret too much about such things, but then I saw this ""Circuit Board"" design in a bluish color - and WINNER!!  That was what I chose.Bottom line - after a couple of months of use, I am extremely pleased with this mouse.  The USB plug is low profile and does not get in the way on my three year old Sony Vaio laptop, and the mouse itself can be used on most any surface with great tracking!  One thing I liked about my Bluetooth mouse was that it worked on most any surface - same with this one!!The M325 tracks well, is portable for laptop use, and it fits nicely / ergonomically in the hand.  I have had some minor challenges with getting the right double click rhythm down at times, and once in a while it does not highlight a single word in some apps with a double click - but other than that a great little mouse!Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good portable, versatile mouse!Thanks for reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CN5OXCIZINQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CWD3IK#wasThisHelpful","R1CN5OXCIZINQ2","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Spot 90 is also a darn good headlamp, and I have owned one for over a year.  I also recently purchased the ""new"" Black Diamond  Spot 130 headlamp, and I am writing a review about both the Spot 90 and 130. If you were thinking of getting this headlamp, give the newer model Spot 130 a look too - I paid the same $30 for each... your call!  You get 40 more lumens and a couple new features, read on! Either way, the Spot 90 is still a darned bright, well made headlamp!!I have owned a number of headlamps over the years, and for $30, Black Diamonds have become my ""go-to"" choice because of the price to value ratio - not many headlamps possess the same quality for such a great price!  These do ""retail"" for $40, but Amazon has them for $30 and now that the Spot 130 is out, getting the Spot 90 for $30 is easier.Here is what I like about the Spot 90:-- The quality - these lamps are well built, and built every bit as good as a Petzl. My Spot 90 is over a year old, has seen heavy use and looks like new.-- The large on / off button - although still not perfect with gloves on, it is easy to operate and does not require too much pressure and fumbling around! The Petzls I own have a smaller button, and sometimes it takes just the right pressure to turn it on, and can be a little harder to locate instantly.-- The fact it has a red / night light mode - I like to do astronomy, and this is invaluable to maintain night vision!-- The head band - good adjustability, comfortable.I am still trying to find out what I don't like about the Spot's - for the price, it is hard to find anything wrong with this headlamp. I guess maybe three levels of brightness instead of just two - high and low.I use my Spot 90 (and now will use the 130) for MANY uses, including:-- first, for night bike riding. We have a handle bar mounted Cygolite for the main light source, and the Spots for the head lamp. When you are riding, and turn your head to the side of the trail to look, you want to be able to see what you are looking at. Handle bar lamps always point straight ahead...-- Camping - of course... when there are no city lights, a bright headlamp is a must!-- Daily chores around the house - my 50 yr old eyes constantly need a back up when doing virtually every chore - just yesterday I had it on my dome as I updated the plumbing valves on all my sinks. I always have one close by, for even the simple chores of more light to read fine print, etc. An invaluable tool, and have made my flashlights obsolete!Comparing tee Spot 90 to the Petzl line of headlamps from a cost perspective - consider the Petzl XP 2 retails for $59.99 and gives you about 80 lumens of light. And to surpass the output of the Spot 90 in the Petzl lineup, you are going to shell out $89.99. Petzls are FINE lights, I own 4 of them of different types, but with the price / per lumen and the quality level of the Black Diamond Spots, my last four headlamp purchases have been the Black Diamonds.So what are the differences between the Spot 90 and the Spot 130?-- How about an additional 40 lumens of light!! And you can really tell the difference between the two.-- When you power on the Spot 130 it defaults to the high intensity beam. To get to the low power beam, you have to push the button twice rapidly. When the Spot 90 is powered up you randomly get low or high power, depending on which mode it was on the last time you were using it. If the 90 does not power up in the mode you want, you have to press once for off, then once more to turn it back on for the correct mode. I like the new 130 defaulting to high intensity beam - most of the time it is the mode I want. On the Spot 90, it is annoying to potentially have to press it three times to get it there - obviously someone at Black Diamond agrees!-- The hinge system on the new Spot 130 seems to be beefed up and more substantial - on the Spot 90 it just seemed to loose.From a technical spec perspective, the Spot 90 and Spot 130 are very similar:-- Both weigh 3.2 grams;-- Both have a rated burn time of 50 hours on TriplePower LED, 200 hours on SinglePower LED;-- Both have a rated distance of 75m on TriplePower LED, 15m on SinglePower LED;-- Both run on 3 AAA batteries, both have a 2 LED red light mode-- One has 130 lumens, the other 90 lumens max outputThanks for reading!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7MOAEZVB7URO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006DCXIAS#wasThisHelpful","R7MOAEZVB7URO","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK... it's a funnel, and as a funnel, it does the job - not much to write about there.

I own a number of polyethylene items, and this I am not 100% convinced it is of the same quality.The finish on this funnel has a bunch of swirl marks / scratches, and it is not finished to a smooth appearance.  Plus, I am not entirely sure where it is made, it has an American flag on the label, but does not actually say ""Made in USA"".  In fact, it does not indicate country of manufacture on the label.Not a bad funnel, but not enough quality that I would give it five stars!Thanks for reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FNF0Z2AF37NW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004X141#wasThisHelpful","R1FNF0Z2AF37NW","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What follows is a long-winded review, read this around bedtime if you are having trouble falling asleep! ;-) For those seeking the Reader's Digest version - overall, I think the Freiling French Press, though expensive, is the best French Press money can buy. I have tried offerings from 4-5 other French Press makers, including Espro and Bodum, and the Freiling IMHO has the highest quality build, has the best heat retention capability during the brew cycle, and will be the most durable long term due to its 100% 18/10 stainless construction - no plastic parts here!!. It is one of the very few 100% stainless French Presses you can find - plus it also a very attractive vessel to boot! I actually leave it out on my counter due to its good looks!! There are many good reasons why the Freiling French Press are the best sellers, and why reviews here on Amazon are so plentiful and positive. Amongst those reasons are quality, reliability, consistency and durability.Do realize however, that just because you spend the money and buy a Freiling will NOT guarantee you will automatically start making great coffee - as with any French Press the method is more important than the tool! You must pay attention to ALL of the variables involved in correct coffee extraction procedures - if you want the best coffee possible with a French Press, it is all about the process - assuring correct brew temperature, you use freshly ground beans, you are using an adequate grinder that grinds to consistent texture, and more!! Below I offer some tips to assuring a great cup of coffee with the Freiling, those may help in your pursuit of the perfect cup!!Just as important - do realize that the Freiling is a BREWING vessel ;-) and not a STORAGE carafe. You will see in the reviews that some complain the Freiling does not keep their coffee ""hot"" for hours - the coffee should only stay in the Freiling for around four minutes to brew, you will need a nice storage carafe to keep it hot thereafter!! Those that keep the coffee in the press with the grounds after the four minute mark are destroying the taste. Moreover, even if you transfer the coffee out, and remove the grounds and then use the Freiling as your storage vessel - you would be much better served purchasing a separate carafe to store the coffee when done. The Freiling is NOT an ideal storage carafe. (For example - I use a Zojirushi glass lined carafe for my needs).***End of Reader's Digest version - now on to the details!!Here is what I like about the Freiling Press:- Double Wall carafe construction - this is both ideal and necessary for the ever-so critical heat retention during your preheating and steeping phases.  The method I employ can hold brew temps between 195 and 204 throughout the entire steeping / brewing phase, and I could never accomplish that with other presses made of glass, plastic, etc. Some have claimed that the Freiling is vacuum sealed in addition, but it is not - it is double walled and that is it.  *** Note - I typically keep my brew temps around 200-202 degrees - please Google ""SCAA recommended coffee brewing temperatures"" for some background on correct temps to brew / extract coffee**- 100% 18/10 stainless - beautifully finished, but it is more than just good looks - the thick stainless assures the press will last for a long time and it will aid in heat retention already mentioned. It is durable and virtually indestructible if used with any modicum of care and not dropped daily on the tile! My 33oz Freiling is 3 years old, and it operates like the day I bought it. Plus, it still looks good also - other than a couple of minor scratches to the polished stainless exterior.- Top / Plunger assembly comes apart for thorough cleaning. You get a sense of the attention to detail and the cost it takes to make a Freiling press when you disassemble the constituent parts that make up the top / plunger. It wreaks of quality through and through... the fact it can be disassembled, and remains 100% stainless is no small feat, and a testament to the quality - and why it costs so much. Consider what it takes to be able to deliver this assembly - and why competing press makers don't!- Double walled top / lid - I already mentioned the double walled carafe - but the fact the lid is ALSO double walled construction is worth calling out- again, the competitors don't even approach this and even make their tops / lids out of PLASTIC says it all.- They are darned nice to look at! Let's face it - they are an attractive vessel.Here is what I don't like about the Freiling:- Price - this one is more of a whine ;-) and not anything wrong with the product, but hey, I can still not like it! Bottom line is I would still buy it again.. To make it less painful, I got this 44oz version for $98 here on Amazon - it was in my cart for over a year in the $125 range, and when I saw the price drop temporarily I jumped on it!- The top on my 33oz version had a weld seam failure around the hole where the plunger is inserted - causing the top to fill with water that I could not get back out. HOWEVER, Freiling sent me a new top when I asked with no hassle... it was a ""one-off"" problem and don't expect it to happen on my other Freilings.- I can't think of anything of substance I DON'T like about the Freiling - if you learn how to use it, perfect your method then this is the top of the heap when it comes to French Press. It is the best tool for the Press job IMHO.I have owned the 33 oz Freiling Stainless Press for a few years and have used it almost daily to make my morning coffee (except for the once a week I use my Technivorm drip brewer). Therefore, I do have experience with Freiling's presses, and understand how to best utilize them to squeeze out the optimal cup of coffee.Some pointers / things to think about as you pursue the ""perfect"" cup of coffee:- Make sure and pre-heat your Press and storage carafe in advance - don't put your coffee / boiling water into a cold French Press; and don't put your finished product in a cold storage carafe!!! (google it, this affects the taste). At a minimum, use hot tap water to pre-heat, which usually gets to 130-140 degrees. Personally, I use boiling water to pre-heat - you can boil it on the stove, or perhaps use something like a Zojirushi hot water kettle / boiler that is ready in advance when you wake!- Use fresh beans, and grind the beans right before use. Coffee beans are best within two weeks of roasting, and most store bought beans can be MANY weeks old by the time you buy them. If you can find a local source for your beans that are fresh, do it. You will notice a marked improvement in your finished product.- Buy a decent quality grinder. The $20 blade grinders are just not good enough for French Press - it needs a consistent, coarse grind. At a minimum, I recommend a Capresso Infinity for around $70, then use the ""Coarse"" settings, dialing it in to where you eliminate 95% of the sludge in your cup. I use an Orphan Espresso LIDO hand grinder ($150), and alternate that with a Capresso Infinity. You can also get a Baratza Virtuoso if you want to spend more! The grind is CRITICAL - it needs to be the correct coarseness - but more importantly needs to be CONSISTENT. Consistency is the main challenge for most cheap grinders on the market.- Assure your steeping / brewing temperatures are in the 195-204 degree range. This is not my own recommendation, this is the ""proven"" range for the best coffee extraction. Invest in something like a Thermapen, or a cheaper temperature probe, that allows you to test the water temperature while steeping. Another critical step to success. For my brewing, I stay in the 200-202 range typically during the four minute brew cycle.  *** Note - please Google ""SCAA recommended coffee brewing temperatures"" for some background on correct temps to brew / extract coffee**- Depress the plunger SLOWLY when it is time, doing it too fast will cause sediment. Also, if the plunger seems to get ""stuck"", lift it ever so slightly, then depress again!- Fill the water level BELOW the spout depression / line in the carafe when filling for brewing / steeping. This will help guarantee less grounds in your finished product.To summarize - now that you have spent the $$ on a top of the line French Press, consider getting a good grinder that can consistently grind on a coarse setting without a lot of ""fines"" in the grind; considerr purchasing a good temperature probe (like a Thermapen to check your temperatures of different components throughout the process to find what needs tweaking; consider getting fresh coffee beans. This will give you an even better cup in the end... also, search the web for you tube videos, etc on different processes, find out what works best for you. Once you experience a ""perfectly"" executed cup of press coffee, you will be hooked!! ;-)Thanks for reading, and best of luck in your choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2508ETIYT4H83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FCE72U#wasThisHelpful","R2508ETIYT4H83","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

HOWEVER, Freiling sent me a new top when I asked with no hassle... it was a ""one-off"" problem and don't expect it to happen on my other Freilings.- I can't think of anything of substance I DON'T like about the Freiling - if you learn how to use it, perfect your method then this is the top of the heap when it comes to French Press. It is the best tool for the Press job IMHO.In addition to this 44oz Freiling Stainless Press, I have owned the 33 oz Freiling Stainless Press for a few years and have used it almost daily to make my morning coffee (except for the once a week I use my Technivorm drip brewer). Therefore, I do have experience with Freiling's presses, and understand how to best utilize them to squeeze out the optimal cup of coffee. So, why did I buy the 44oz Freiling when I already own the 33oz? For one, that extra cup on some days makes a difference ;-) and second I think the Freilings are cool, have grown attached to them and see absolutely nothing wrong with owning two different sizes!! Lol. So there it is...Finally, some pointers / things to think about as you pursue the ""perfect"" cup of coffee:- Make sure and pre-heat your Press and storage carafe in advance - don't put your coffee / boiling water into a cold French Press; and don't put your finished product in a cold storage carafe!!! (google it, this affects the taste). At a minimum, use hot tap water to pre-heat, which usually gets to 130-140 degrees. Personally, I use boiling water to pre-heat - you can boil it on the stove, or perhaps use something like a Zojirushi hot water kettle / boiler that is ready in advance when you wake!- Use fresh beans, and grind the beans right before use. Coffee beans are best within two weeks of roasting, and most store bought beans can be MANY weeks old by the time you buy them. If you can find a local source for your beans that are fresh, do it. You will notice a marked improvement in your finished product.- Buy a decent quality grinder. The $20 blade grinders are just not good enough for French Press - it needs a consistent, coarse grind. At a minimum, I recommend a Capresso Infinity for around $70, then use the ""Coarse"" settings, dialing it in to where you eliminate 95% of the sludge in your cup. I use an Orphan Espresso LIDO hand grinder ($150), and alternate that with a Capresso Infinity. You can also get a Baratza Virtuoso if you want to spend more! The grind is CRITICAL - it needs to be the correct coarseness - but more importantly needs to be CONSISTENT. Consistency is the main challenge for most cheap grinders on the market.- Assure your steeping / brewing temperatures are in the 195-204 degree range. This is not my own recommendation, this is the ""proven"" range for the best coffee extraction. Invest in something like a Thermapen, or a cheaper temperature probe, that allows you to test the water temperature while steeping. Another critical step to success. For my brewing, I stay in the 200-202 range typically during the four minute brew cycle. *** Note - please Google ""SCAA recommended coffee brewing temperatures"" for some background on correct temps to brew / extract coffee**- Depress the plunger SLOWLY when it is time, doing it too fast will cause sediment. Also, if the plunger seems to get ""stuck"", lift it ever so slightly, then depress again!- Fill the water level BELOW the spout depression / line in the carafe when filling for brewing / steeping. This will help guarantee less grounds in your finished product.To summarize - now that you have spent the $$ on a top of the line French Press, consider getting a good grinder that can consistently grind on a coarse setting without a lot of ""fines"" in the grind; considerr purchasing a good temperature probe (like a Thermapen to check your temperatures of different components throughout the process to find what needs tweaking; consider getting fresh coffee beans. This will give you an even better cup in the end... also, search the web for you tube videos, etc on different processes, find out what works best for you. Once you experience a ""perfectly"" executed cup of press coffee, you will be hooked!! ;-)Thanks for reading, and best of luck in your choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H31YZ5RU7J4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QM6NKK#wasThisHelpful","R1H31YZ5RU7J4X","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These meters are good for what they are, and for the cost.  For a $20 meter, and then paired with the Calibration Solution (342 NaCl), these can be a fairly accurate, reliable meter.However, if you are looking for repeatable precision, where you get the same reading on a consistent basis, plan on spending more on a better meter.  You will find that these TDS-4's will have a little variance, and often times more than the + / - 2% claimed.  You can easily get different readings in the same solution if you try also.This DOES NOT mean this is a poor meter - for the cost, this does a bang up job.  Some things to help you get good readings:-- Turn off the meter, then turn it back on before each reading.  It IS a little more hassle, but it will help with accuracy.  The instructions say the same thing, and there is a reason for that.-- When changing solutions / water sources to be measured (like when going from tap water to RO, etc), turn the meter off, and gently shake the meter to get the water trapped in the tip out.-- Sometimes when you submerse the meter, there will be an air buble trapped in the tip.  Gently swish the tip around to release the bubble or you will get skewed readings!-- If you drop the meter, you will probably need to recalibrate it!For the price, I would recommend this meter!  Just don't expect $100 build quality and precision, that is not what this meter is!!Thanks for reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGSRE871USWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002T6L5M#wasThisHelpful","RYGSRE871USWW","A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4BNBT5GNWZJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Apparently this movie resonates with some people. Maybe the only way to find out is to watch it. But for me, it was a disappointment. The dvd jacket makes it look like two people having a fun time but there was a lot of ugliness (in behavior and character) and many, many unrealistic scenarios, including the main premise, that these two very different lead characters fall in deep love in the course of a few hours.For those that care, yes the two leads are married to other people. No, they don't ""do"" much of anything aside from what would be called emotional cheating.Here are the sort of things that drove me crazy (not in a good way):The Mom behaves very rudely to another tour group, interrupting their tour and dredging up her own family dysfunction in a rant. One person in the tour group responds with some minor sarcastic remark like ""Thanks for sharing!"" Then the dad, the uptight conventional heart surgeon, makes him (the recipient of the abuse) apologize instead of the other way around!The dad has a fear of heights which the mom miraculously cures in a few minutes atop the bell tower.The two parents steal bicycles for an extended joy ride around campus and this is supposed to be funny?Both parents completely ditch their children on an important college tour that was supposed to be a bonding experience. They don't even meet their kids for lunch and they lie to their kids in order to prolong their escapades with each other. Besides being an awful life choice, it's unbelievable, particularly on the part of the dad.I didn't exactly find it boring and I did watch it through (maybe because I was sick and didn't have anything better to do) but it was not an enjoyable experience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29AFUJMPUZPB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQOD0SM#wasThisHelpful","R29AFUJMPUZPB5","A3C00N4UHA5XYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C00N4UHA5XYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Grip you with its emotional power?"" ""Mesmerize you with its magic?"" I don't think so.SLIGHT SPOILER BELOW BUT YOU WOULD KNOW THAT PART WAS COMING RIGHT FROM THE GET-GOIt started out kind of interesting, then as the lead character got more and more into the hundred names, it wandered all over the place with a lot of cardboard characters. There were so many incidental characters that from time to time when a name would pop up I either didn't remember ever seeing that name before, or I couldn't remember who they were.After about the middle, when Kitty finally ""gets it"" but the reader still doesn't, I just kept reading to see what the connection was, which in the end was very anticlimactic.Lots of unbelievable parts, no motivation given for how so many characters suddenly blossomed or became completely different. Lots of high-school-like ""love"" interest--oh, does he love me or not? oh was that a friendly hug or does it mean something more? oh what did that look mean?--and in the end pretty much everybody pairs off predictably.In my life nothing works like that. A bunch of random people, most with issues, would not have a jolly good time together as well as find true love. Everything tied up too neatly. The author tried to leave a few strings hanging but it didn't offset all the happily ever afters.I was irritated by this sort of writing:""Ashford Private College was situated on Parnell Square beside the Irish Writers' Centre, which faced the Garden of Remembrance and other such important venues as the Gate Theatre and Rotunda Maternity Hospital.""Was she getting paid by the word? None of those names mean anything to me, they don't create a picture in my mind, and it's all completely irrelevant to the story. Maybe Irish readers get something out of it, I don't know.If you're stuck somewhere and this is the only book available, or the choice is Stephen King or this book, and you hate scary books, then by all means read this book.

"I enjoyed the first part of the book and was looking forward to perhaps some profound insight....well....I personally identified with many themes in the first part--feeling stuck and adrift in a location not of one's choosing, a custody battle with the social worker distinctly in the ex's camp, a surprise home visit, a stacked deck of a parent-teacher meeting. Wow, I've been there and she nailed it.Then somewhere in the middle of the book, I felt like I had been duped into reading a romance novel of the very kind that the heroine is being pressured to write. Granted, none of it is very explicit, but there was scene after scene of virile manhood, lusting women. Suddenly everybody is sexy, attractive, and compatible. Along with the harebrained and completely unbelievable idea of the whorehouse for women.I continued reading to see how it all turned out, a little too neatly for my taste, and based on subterfuge and blackmail rather than insight or personal growth. So, more like beach reading than anything else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8Q2LQZAH5CFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=143919503X#wasThisHelpful","R8Q2LQZAH5CFH","A3C00N4UHA5XYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C00N4UHA5XYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was expecting a cat and mouse story of a painting hidden away, changing hands multiple times, hidden from or stolen by the Nazis until finally rediscovered in some obscure location. This book is nothing like that. The painting was pretty much in plain sight the whole time and the story of its repatriation is a complicated one of love, high society, women's rights, Nazism and collaboration, and institutional and national denial of that Nazism and collaboration.I wasn't looking for another book on the Holocaust but that's what I got, from a new and fascinating perspective. It was positively frightening and astounding to learn that even 60 years after the fall of Hitler, Austria and Austrians were still whitewashing their involvement, refusing to give back treasures that any average lay person would agree had been stolen, allowing documented Nazi experimental ""physicians"" not just to live in peace but even to teach medical students! And to learn that the U.S. knowingly hired Nazi scientists for our rocket projects!This book covers a lot of territory, really giving you a feel for the age, providing very personal experiences, while not dwelling too long on the horrors, all the while entwining the details of the portrait. I wish I had realized sooner that everything has been documented page by page in Notes at the end of the book, although there aren't actual footnotes.Sometimes the author's writing is obtuse and you're left trying to figure out the meaning of a sentence. Definitely it is hard to keep track of all the characters but I feel I got the gist of it even if maybe I have missed some details.I have a print of Klimt's beech forest on my wall, just because I like it. I never knew anything more about him and never particularly cared for his gold paintings, but now they appeal to me in a different way. Just seeing Adele's portrait brings to mind that whole era as well as the undying love her husband had for her. Whether or not she had an affair with Klimt, and what to think of his treatment of women, there's a whole other thought-provoking avenue to explore.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34YKA6SVEYWYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307265641#wasThisHelpful","R34YKA6SVEYWYG","A3C00N4UHA5XYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C00N4UHA5XYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I already have a SWE Autochron Wireless Wall Switch Timer (sorry, the Insert Product Link is not working). I wanted another timer for a different room and thought I would try this one. This timer would turn my switch on but not off. I tried several times. I also tried the Autochron on that switch and it would not turn the switch off either, so it's something to do with that particular switch which is pretty old. So I returned this unit and will have to devise Plan B.Also, FYI, I had to buy a standard face plate for my switch which had a wooden plate that left the switch too far recessed. Not a big deal, just another step.Some comparisons of this unit vs. the Autochron:-- Woods is smaller and narrower.-- Woods is easier to program.-- Autochron is easier to install and remove, a distinct advantage if you want it out of your way inbetween vacations.-- Autochron allows you to open the battery compartment and manually turn the switch on or off, in addition to pushing a button like on the Woods.Because I do not leave my timer in place all the time, I much prefer the Autochron unit. One screw to install. The Woods requires fumbling with two tiny recessed screws in addition to two screws through the face plate.

"UPDATE:Router worked fine first day. Next day I noticed slowness and speed test result was 1.5 mbps! (60 mbps yesterday)When I unhooked the router and just ran the pc through the modem only, I got my 60 mbps back. Hooked up the TP-Link again, 1.5 mbps. Reinstalled my old Linksys WRT54G2 v1 router, I had 60 mbps again. That's all the troubleshooting I'm doing. I am returning the TP-Link to amazon while I still can. I will probably look locally for a more up to date router (the Linksys suffers from WPS vulnerability).My original review was 4 stars:""Some trouble getting set up, a few minor complaints, but a good deal for $20""Unlike most others, it seems, I had to do some troubleshooting getting this router set up. It comes with a flier with special instructions for error messages relating to cable internet so I am not the only one with this problem. First I just tried inserting the cd and following the directions but it failed.In case of failure it gives you an option to go back and try a cloning process which also failed. Then I tried starting at the beginning again and doing the Easy Setup with cloning, no go. I followed the troubleshooting for cable instructions (several pages of fine print but not as bad as it looked), again no go until the very last step (to be followed if all else has failed) of rebooting both modem and router, then finally Bingo.Perhaps rebooting would have taken care of it earlier in the process. My modem takes a long time to get up to speed and I had already unplugged it before attempting to install this router so I was hoping to avoid doing it again.I was also hoping to see full speed on my Nexus 7. I am getting 60 mb on my wired pc. With this router I am getting 26 on the Nexus vs. 18 previously, so an improvement, but not what I was hoping for. I am measuring the speed when the nexus is practically right next to the router.The Quality of Service, aka Bandwidth Control setting, is not at all intuitive. Other reviewers rave about it but I don't have a clue even though I am looking at the manual. I'm fairly savvy about computers but this process calls for entering ""IP range,"" ""port range,"" and egress and ingress measurements in Kbps. I'm not sure how bandwidth is allocated if I do not set up any controls. Not a big issue for me but one I had hoped to experiment with.The sideways power block required me to get an extension cord to plug this thing in. Oh, and the port colors are exactly opposite of my old router (blue/yellow) and are labeled as and referred to as ""WAN"" and ""LAN"" rather than ethernet and internet. Not too hard to just follow the illustration but my cables are blue and yellow so it's a little mind-boggling to set them up opposite. This router comes with one fairly short cat 5 cable in neutral beige.My product was brand new in a plastic-sealed box. Can't tell about longevity or customer service at this point. I cannot find anything indicating a warranty anywhere on the box, on the paperwork that came with it, or online, but at this price point it doesn't matter much. Most companies require you to send in the defective product at your own expense which nearly negates any benefit.There is a toll-free 24/7 customer service number.

"Very well made and a great idea, very ingenious. However, I know it doesn't say this, but I thought the small size would be a lighter weight rope, but it's not. The first thing I noticed when I pulled it out of the package was how heavy it is, and the rope is quite thick and hefty. My dog is just under 15 pounds. I read more than one review from a chihuahua owner which led me to believe this was sized for smaller breeds, not just in length, but not so. I realize this is my own misunderstanding, just giving you a heads up. I can't even imagine a chihuahua wearing this thing, but apparently some do.I gave it a whirl anyway. For me, it's actually trickier to get on than the step-in harness we have been using. My dog kept trying to bite it as I tried to put it on her, which does not usually happen with our regular harness and leash. I imagine that would get better.Tried actually walking her with it and she still pulled. If anything, at one point she smelled something interesting and braced her legs against the ground harder than ever. So, no improvement on that front.It's marketed as escape-proof but the instructions do have a disclaimer, sorry I don't remember what it said exactly, something about not allowing slack somewhere. I sometimes pick my dog up to avoid an unpleasant doggie encounter and she has managed to slip out of her regular harness while being held (and squirming). I was afraid something similar might be possible with the Harness Lead.I can see where this can be a great option for dog shelters or multiple pet owners because it's easily adjustable to fit different sizes of dogs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11JLAC8LR7JDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I589WIU#wasThisHelpful","R11JLAC8LR7JDL","A3C00N4UHA5XYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C00N4UHA5XYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have continued to wear an old ragged parka because I have not been able to find a replacement at a reasonable price till now. This jacket packs a lot into one reasonably priced package:  * Pit zips  * Besides handwarmer pockets, another exterior zipped pocket for quick access to money or key  * Storm flap over main zipper (I wish the pocket zippers were covered but they are not)  * Snow skirt and a zipper to attach pants  * Great insulation including sleevesI will address some issues I read about in reviews here and on other sites:Yes it runs small. I normally buy size medium jackets and they allow me lots of room for layering. Not this one, but it is so warm I won't need layers. I am  5' 2"" and weigh 118, hourglass figure, and this jacket is snug and is about mid-palm length. From the back neck seam to the hem in size M is 26 inches. The jacket itself has a distinct hourglass shape.Yes all those snaps on the front flap are a nuisance, but to slip in and out of it quickly, you can get by with just snapping the bottom two snaps and the rest of the flaps stay in place well enough.It's definitely very warm and not appropriate for warmer weather skiing. I was looking for warmth and I'm using this for streetwear. When it's bitter cold I just want to be able to put on something really warm and not mess with umpteen layers. I generally leave the pit zips open.The hood can be cinched on either side of your chin as well as at the center back of your head.The sleeves do not have inner cuffs, which I was worried about, but I can snap them on the smallest setting without having to undo them to get it on and off, and I think it will be just fine.It is heavier weight-wise than my last parka but doesn't feel heavy on me. The fabric does not feel too stiff. I can't test out the waterproof/breathability just now, but the specs are good and it has a good company standing behind it.It has just a one-way zipper, which I prefer, but if you definitely want a zipper that can open from either the top or the bottom, this jacket is not the one for you.I am so happy to get a new jacket with a unique design at a price I can afford!UPDATE NOV 2015: I have had more than one perfect stranger compliment me on this jacket and I am totally happy with its looks and performance..","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ITTTWUKM6J9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3LSQK0#wasThisHelpful","R2ITTTWUKM6J9M","A3C00N4UHA5XYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C00N4UHA5XYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE:My daughter did in fact come home with an active lice infestation. I spent about half an hour going over her head and found 6 lice and 3 nits. To check for lice I used the pointy end of a rat tail comb and systematically checked her scalp in sections of about an inch or two. I figured the more lice and nits I removed ahead of the treatment, the less chance of one managing to escape the gel.This gel was just fine to use and not as slippery and drippy as I remember the lotion being, plus much shorter time frame overall. After 20 minutes, I used handfuls of cheap shampoo and worked it into her hair before trying to wet it. I probably used a good cup of shampoo, and then I did a second lathering (the first go-round of shampoo hardly even lathered after wetting). It came out fine and left her hair feeling very soft! Then I scrubbed the tub well to remove the slippery residue.I had checked at the Hedrin website before deciding how much to buy, and I wish I had bought more. This 100 ml bottle barely covered my daughter's long thick wavy hair. I made sure to get her scalp area very well but I was just barely able to work it down to the ends. Hopefully no lice scurried down there to escape if any had missed my pre-treatment examination.This is what the Hedrin website says:""How much will I need?A little Hedrin goes a long way. The amount needed depends entirely upon the length of hair to be treated. A 50ml bottle should be sufficient for a two-dose treatment of short hair. Longer hair or multiple treatments will require a larger bottle.""My recommendation is, if the person's hair is thick and down to the middle of their back, you'll need more than 100 ml for a single treatment of the gel. Possibly the lotion, being runnier, requires less, but the runniness is what makes the lotion potentially less effective (and you have to leave it on for hours).WHAT FOLLOWS IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:Disclaimer: I have not yet used this exact product (read on, I'll explain) because my daughter is currently out of the country where she picked up head lice and was treated with who knows what. She wanted me to be ready to check her head and re-treat when she gets back home. I was so delighted to find that I can now order Hedrin through amazon!To explain, when my daughter was younger she got head lice twice and we had fabulous success with Hedrin Lotion (a friend just happened to be traveling in England at that moment and brought it back for us, after I discovered it through my internet research).Since then, Hedrin has been perfecting their product and they now offer Hedrin in a gel form (this product) which had excellent results in clinical trials. Evidently the gel is easier to apply and sticks to the hair and lice better, resulting in a better kill rate in a shorter time. Other than one being gel and the other lotion, they have the same active ingredient and strength.The product title on amazon says 15 minutes and the description says 1 hour. 15 minutes is the latest recommendation, based on actual studies, and that's what's on the box.The bottle I received is from a recently manufactured lot with an expiration date almost 2 years out. I ordered this on a Sunday and found it in my mailbox on a Monday just 8 days later, COMING FROM ENGLAND, even though the expected arrival date was 4 to 6 weeks after my order date. Yay!!In previous dealings with lice, we have used Nix (which is very toxic, stinky, and doesn't kill eggs so has to be done at least twice plus studies are finding very low efficacy because of resistant strains of lice), Cetaphil lotion (google it; I found the smell so nauseating and it so hard to get out of one's hair that I was ready to go back to Nix), and Hedrin lotion (hands down winner).I don't know why the US doesn't come out of the dark ages and license some of the newer treatments that are not toxic. You can buy them in Canada and overseas. And they are not some quack treatment--Canada's health service will pay for them for instance.I have now discovered that here in the US we can buy LiceMD Pesticide Free which is also a dimethicone product. It's licensed as a cosmetic (although it's in the head lice section of the store) which I guess means it doesn't have to go through the more exhaustive FDA approval process for drugs.LiceMD promotes itself just as an aid to nit-combing, but if we need a second lice treatment after the Hedrin, I am going to try LiceMD and see if it seems the same. I have not been able to find what percentage dimethicone it has, to compare it to Hedrin which is 4%. I can buy LiceMD locally as needed which of course is more convenient than sending off to UK. But hey, I was impressed with the delivery, and the gel may be just the ticket.You can search online and find various studies and clinical trials comparing different treatments, their results, and their safety. No product offers 100% because of possible human errors in application--miss one tiny section of hair and there might be an egg left to hatch out--so careful application is very important.This product is very slippery and hard to wash out of hair, but otherwise it is way less objectionable than other treatments. As far as the slippery-ness, just one drop on the floor could cause someone to slip, and you will have to scrub your tub/shower well afterwards to avoid falls. When we used Hedrin before, we had a utility sink for washing it out which was a great option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMSX0DHRFXFIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OE69T6#wasThisHelpful","RMSX0DHRFXFIE","A3C00N4UHA5XYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C00N4UHA5XYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always set lamp timers when I'm going to be out of town, but realistically, it's the ceiling lights that are frequently on when I'm actually at home. Up till now I've been rigging up a floor lamp, minus shade, with very bright bulb, on a lamp timer, to try to mimic my typically brightly lit kitchen.This gadget makes it happen! I am testing it out now and so far so good.I'm not sure if I'm going to leave it installed since my next trip is 5 months away, but it's simple to install and uninstall, held in place just by the lower screw of the faceplate (they provide a longer screw to accommodate the thickness of the device). While the timer allows for manual override, this is a switch I often turn on and off and I think I'll want the ultimate convenience of just quickly flipping the switch as I walk by.The programming is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. I wrote out some notes for myself. Sometimes you hit Enter when you think you would, sometimes you don't, but once you play with it a little you will see that it's actually pretty easy. You can go in and change just one part of a program if you want (i.e., change only the OFF time).I think the weirdest thing, and most counter-intuitive, is that as you start to set a program, say for the group of days M-F, and you have set the ON time, when you go to set the OFF time you have to reenter the M-F again or it will program the OFF time for some other default day. It's no big deal to hit ""DAY"" a few times to get to M-F again, it's just not what you'd expect. The first time I tried programming, I ended up with the timer set to come on at 6 for MTWTh but off at 8 just on Tues.I highly recommend you program it before installing it, just for comfort and ease of accessibility--not the timer's fault--it's just much easier to be sitting at the table in good light compared to bending over in front of a light switch--especially the first few tries when you're probably going to mess up and have to redo it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UPQ35B11UV78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VW2LA6#wasThisHelpful","R2UPQ35B11UV78","A3C00N4UHA5XYX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3C00N4UHA5XYX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If your idea of a fun movie is sitting in on someone's marriage counseling, by all means watch this movie. However, that's not my idea of a good time and frankly it wasn't even interesting. I borrowed this movie from the library and the blurbs on the case used words like ""funny"" and ""comedy,"" but they lied.I thought with Steve Carell being some big therapist the couple had to fly out of state to see, there was going to be some humor there but his part was totally straight and very conventional. I have no idea why anybody would spend big bucks for such therapy, a brand new college grad could have provided the same quality of therapy. Even with us (the audience) sitting in on the therapy sessions, we never really learn why the main characters have ended up the way they did. And a LOT of the movie consists of therapy sessions.Yes there were a few chuckles here and there and a heartwarming ending, but I really only kept watching because with such good actors I felt sure it must get better (wrong).If you don't agree with my review, please just enjoy this movie, write your own glowing review, and don't slam me. I'm entitled to my opinion and maybe someone else will benefit from my review. Sorry to be on the defensive but movie reviews seem to be a world unto themselves. I'm just trying to be helpful.

"The authors, principals in Skyline Group International, Inc., a Silicon Valley-based human capital solutions company, contend that too many people waste their time working on their weaknesses. A better strategy is to focus on the neglected skills in the middle.One quoted study backs this point up:The Sales Executive Council also looked at the middle performers (the middle 60 percent) that produced $271 million. Getting 5 percent more out of them would yield another $13.5 million--almost double what you would get out of the high performers! Although the top salespeople achieved much higher sales individually, it didn't make sense to squeeze another 5 percent out of them versus 5 percent out of each of the middle performers.What I liked best about this shirt, but oh-so-valuable book was the accompanying free online Hidden Strengths Assessment.In addition, I liked the five-step Hidden Strengths Development Plan:1.

Rather, he concentrates on some less well-known but historically sihnificant events that changed America.In doing so, I learned about the significance of January 25, 1787.

Bookbinder.The author, a clinical psychologist, makes psychology come alive in this short, readable book that explains the following:Empathic acknowledging is listening with empathy (empathic listening) to another person and then station (acknowledging) your understanding of what she's communicating to you.He does so by using practical examples, such as the following:I was in a self-serve soup and salad restaurant, and ready for dessert. After walking to the frozen yogurt machine, I noticed that vanilla was available, but alas, chocolate was not. There was an employee nearby, whose nametag read ""Manager."" I asked her, ""What happened to the chocolate yogurt?""""They didn't deliver it today,"" she replied, and then returned to what she was doing . . .I thought that if she had added to her reply an empathic acknowledgement, such as ""You seem disappointed,"" I probably would have felt less disappointed than I actually did.Perhaps my favorite part of the book was the chapter on ""Controlling the Urge to Talk.""

What he learned: Always have a backup.In addition, I enjoyed the tales of real-life figures who overcame adversity early in their lives, including entrepreneur Steve Jobs, Olympic Gold Medalists Gabby Douglas and Mikaela Shiffrin, and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Malala Yousafzai.I wish such a book had been available when I was younger.My only criticism: I only wish that somebody else had done the narration; e.g., somebody with a more youthful-sounding voice and/or who had more enthusiasm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFVUOCQ7HS6BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316284092#wasThisHelpful","RFVUOCQ7HS6BS","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Heard HOW GOOGLE WORKS (Hachette Audio), written by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg and read by Holter Graham.The authors, both with Google for over 10 years, have first hand experience about the company--and it shows in the entertaining, informative book that presents many of the secrets behind the company's success.One that really struck home had to do with establishing a culture of yes. They note:""Saying yes begins things. Saying yes is how things grow. . . . And attitude of yes is how you will be able to go forward in these uncertain times.""In addition, I enjoyed finding out about Google's culture and how the company does such things as installing pool tables to encourage employees to share ideas (even while playing pool during regularly-scheduled hours).HOW GOOGLE WORKS contains many ideas that can be applied to any company, regardless of industry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BET0OLSBYCTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455582344#wasThisHelpful","R2BET0OLSBYCTU","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OWN YOUR FUTURE: HOW TO THINK LIKE AN ENTREPRENEUR AND THRIVE IN AN UNPREDICTALBE ECONOMY (AMACOM) by  Paul R. Brown with Charles F. Kiefer and Leonard A. Schlesinger takes a look at serial entrepreneurs--those who have launched two or more successful businesses--and presents something known as the ALBR Model for acting in a new economy.This includes the following steps:1. Act.2. Learn.3. Build.4. Repeat.What made the book so valuable, as well as interesting, was the fact that the authors then gave several real-life examples of how these steps were actually put into practice.I especially liked Appendix B, which showed how ALBR could also be used in the public sector.OWN YOUR OWN FUTURE is worthwhile reading for those searching for a first job, as well as for anybody else fretting about his or his industry and what the future holds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CLLO24FAUU9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0814434096#wasThisHelpful","R2CLLO24FAUU9R","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

MARTIN LUTHER KING'S FINAL YEAR (Hachette Audio), written by Tavis Smiley with David Ritz and read by Smiley.It presents a look at the final 365 days of King's life, including much information that I hadn't know about at the time. Specifically, I didn't realize that he faced great opposition--from the country's black middle class and militants, the press and the president. Also, seemingly on a daily basis, he had his character, ideology and political tactics questioned.I liked the fact that the book did not overlook his faults, but even in spite of them, listening to DEATH OF A KING made me appreciate King's contributions to American society even more so than I had previously.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VIM3TA70W78A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316332763#wasThisHelpful","R3VIM3TA70W78A","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"STUPIDPARTY MATH V. MYTH: UNMAKING THE DESCRUCTIVE FORCES ERODING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY (Fact Over Fiction) by Patrick M. Andendall is an engrossing book that presents documented facts and resources to respond to numerous misconceptions held by too many Republicans.Now before you get up in arms about that comment, especially if you're a Republican, please consider the fact that the author claims to be a conservative. He also based the idea for the title from Louisiana's Governor Bobby Jindalls's quote: ""We've got to stop being the stupid party. We've got to stop insulting the intelligence of voters. We need to trust the smarts of the American people.""Arendall goes on to cover such topics as the Founding Factors, the House, who are the 47% moochers, job and the economy, and guns, among others. He does so with page after page of research that's funny, but unfortunately, also true.For example, he presents such quotes as the following:* Rick Santorum: ""I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created--in the sense of rape--but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you . . . rape victims should make the most of a bad situation.""* Sean Hannity: ""Halloween is a liberal holidays because we're teaching our children to be for something for free. . . . We're teaching kids to knock on other people's doors and ask for a handout.""* Art Robinson [chairperson of the Oregon Republican Party]: ""My advice to home school parents is to teach geography, history and government largely from books which were written in the 1950s and earlier, before it became popular to teach over racism under the rubric or 'multiculturalism.' ""STUPIDPARTY also contains many interesting charts, as well as humorous cartoons. My only criticism of the book is that I wish it had contained an index. Perhaps that will happen in what I hope will be a second edition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I5AWUBM237PK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0996073906#wasThisHelpful","R1I5AWUBM237PK","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SAVING BABE RUTH: A NOVEL BASED ON A TRUE STORY (Hillcrest House Publishing) by Tom Swyers is a terrific first novel about a lawyer and Civil War buff who volunteers to serve as commissioner for his town's Babe Ruth baseball league.It is then that all hell breaks loose. A local promoter keeps taking away all the best players, and he also wants to take away the town's best field.The more I got into the story, the more I started to feel for the lawyer and his family. In addition, the subplots held my attention, as well as such writing as in the following passage:Over the years, there had developed long periods of silence between the two on the ride home from a loss, a silence broken only by the rush of air into the car as they drove with the windows open to rid themselves of the smell: the fermenting equipment bags holding the sweat of every team member in the foam helmet liners, the rain-soaked baseballs that had become moldy at the bottom of the baseball bucket because David did not get to drying them in the sun or in the oven.I also liked how the author incorporated details about baseball that would resonate with any real fan; e.g., the story about Ruth Steinagen and Eddie Waitkus.If you've ever been involved in youth baseball as a player or parent, then SAVING BABE RUTH is a book you won't want to miss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O17LPOBWWDWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941440002#wasThisHelpful","R2O17LPOBWWDWM","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I'm perhaps not completely objective about the following review, in that I'm a friend of the book's author.That said, I was thoroughly engrossed by EPISODES: A POETIC MEMOIR (ABLiA Media) by Rodney Richards.It is the amazing story of a dedicated New Jersey civil service and deeply religious man who attempts to lead a normal life despite the fact that he is bipolar.His descriptions of what that entails were frightening, especially his account of a 9-day trip overseas that he took on the spur of the moment. I felt myself genuinely concerned for his safety.I give Richards a lot of credit for not only attempting to master his condition, but also for sharing his story with the rest of the world.

"ANIMATING YOUR CAREER (Brigantine Media) by Steve Hickner is all about getting ahead in various creative fields.The author, a film director at Dreamworks Animation, makes the book come alive by his use of many examples from both his life and films he has worked on. So by reading it, youâ€™ll get real-life tips and suggestionsâ€“such as this one:One day, while she [my mother] was sitting in her chair with a hardback, I asked why it took her so long to finish a book. She closed her book and said the words that Iâ€™ve cherished eve since.â€œYou know that I love to read. But every time one of my kids comes over to talk to me, I always stop what Iâ€™m reading. I now at that moment, they need to talk to their mother. I never know what they are going to say, but I want them to know that whatever they say is important to me. So I put the book down, because my kids are more important than a book.â€As might be expected, Hickner also included many illustrations that helped drive home his points.

And for Godâ€™s sake why?He does so via more than two dozen essays, ranging from how Christians and Jews celebrate their holidays to the politics of faith and covering a lot of other stuff in-between.One of my favorite sections had to do with the reasons that Black believes in God. These include:* An airplane that takes off and lands on time.An unexpected check.Driving across country and one of my favorite songs come on the radio.The laughter of a childâ€“in the distance and never on a plan.In an attempt to present a balanced picture, he then cites reasons that he doesnâ€™t believe in God.

"TRAJECTORY: 7 CAREER STRATEGIES TO TAKE YOU FROM WHERE YOU ARE TO WHERE YOU WANT TO BE (AMACOM) by David L. Van Rooy is a book designed to help you build a foundation of achievement.The author, Senior Director, Global Organizational Effectiveness at Walmart, used many relevant examples from business to make his points. This one especially caught my attention, in which he discussed how National Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux handled his cancer diagnosis early in 1993:A month later he began a series of twenty-two radiation treatments. What is truly amazing is what he did right after his final treatment: He not only boarded a plane to rejoin the team abut also actually played in the game that night. While many were surprised, others felt that this was Lemieux's plan all along. He had prepared every day during his treatment with the intent to return as quickly as possible. As Lemieux stated during his radiation treatment , he was always thinking positively about not just returning to the NHL, but also retaining the NHL scoring title. This strong self-confidence enabled him to think ahead and to avoid the negativity that can all too easily turn into stagnation.I also liked how Van Rooy cited various psychological studies. And his end-of-chapter exercises were most insightful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34XYRM7R1LK00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0814433901#wasThisHelpful","R34XYRM7R1LK00","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Recently, I heard Lynne Martin speak about HOME SWEET ANYWHERE: HOW WE SOLD OUR HOUSE, CREATED A NEW LIFE, AND SAW THE WORLD (Sourcebooks, Inc.). I was intrigued by what she had to say and so looked forward to reading her memoir.It did not disappoint. Her accounts of visits to Mexico, Buenos Aires, Turkey, Paris Italy, Britain, Ireland, Morocco and Portugal made me feel almost as if I was in each country with both her and her husband Tim.I learned some things, too; for example, repositioning cruises are a great way to get you where you want expensively. Also, when traveling, ""No matter how distressing your situation might seem at the time, inconvenient travel events make great dinner-table yarns later.""But perhaps most importantly, I'll try to remember this lesson that the author learned from the wife of one friend whose husband has Parkinson's disease and uses a walker. She wrote, ""Oh, ""Gerry says to send his love and remind you, 'Postpone nothing.' ""My only criticism of the book had to do with the fact that there were no pictures.

In 2012, a study of more than 2,800 adults found that ginkgo didnâ€™t ward off Alzheimerâ€™s disease.* One popular homeopathic remedy is oscillococcinum, promoted for the treatment of flu. Homeopaths make oscillococcinum by homogenizing the heart and liver of a Burberry duck, diluting it in water one-hundredthfold, and repeating the hundrethfold dilution two hundred times. A solution this dilute doesnâ€™tâ€™ contain a single molecule of the Burberry. In fact, the preparation is so dilate that not a single molecule of the duck would be found if the final volume were that of the universe. The duck is one. From a scientistâ€™s standpoint, oscillococcinum is one gram of sugar.And especially this passage:* In the end, if a medicine works (like folic acid to prevent birth defects), itâ€™s valuable, and if it doesnâ€™t work (like saw palmetto to shrink prostate), itâ€™s not. â€œThereâ€™s no name for alternative medicines that work,â€ Says Joe Schwarcz, professor of chemistry and the director of the Office for Science and Society at McGill University. â€œItâ€™s called medicine.â€I strongly recommend DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC?, especially if youâ€™re open to analyzing claims that have no medical basis to back them up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVTG6930LPF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062222961#wasThisHelpful","R2FVTG6930LPF4","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Malcolm Gladwell has another winner in DAVID AND GOLIATH: UNDERDOGS, MISFITS, AND THE ART OF BATTLING GIANTS (Little, Brown and Company).In his latest effort, the author follows the format of his previous bestsellersâ€“THE TIPPING POINT, BLIK, OUTLIERS and WHAT THE DOG SAWâ€“and uses history, psychology and story-telling to get us to look at the world differently.He points out that what looks like suffering and adversity to others can actually work out to somebody elseâ€™s advantage, using such examples as the following:* According to research done by Mitchell Change of the University of California, the likelihood of someone completing a STEM degreeâ€“all things being equal, rises by 2 percentage points for every 10-point decrease in the universityâ€™s average SAT score. The smarter your peers, the dumber you feel; the dumber you feel, the more likely you are to drop out of science.* Law school, of course, required even more reading. But [David] Boies discovered that there were summaries of the major casesâ€“guides that would boil down the key point of a long Supreme Court opinion to a page or so. Plus, he was a good listener. â€œListening,â€ he says, â€œis something Iâ€™ve been doing essentially all my life. I learned to do it because that was the only way I could learn.â€And:* The reason most police departments around the world havenâ€™t followed Jaffeâ€™s lead is that she did didnâ€™t seem right Johnnie Jones was a bad kid.

If the police chief in your town announced, in the face of a major crime wave, that she was going to start hugging and feeding the families of the criminals roaming the streets, youâ€™d be speechlessâ€“right?DAVID AND GOLIATH has me looking forward to Gladwellâ€™s next book.

"Heard A THOUSAND NAMES FOR JOY: LIVING IN HARMONY WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE (Random House Audio), written and read by Byron Katie with Stephen Mitchell.The authorsâ€“also married to each otherâ€“combine to bring together the Work, Katieâ€™s form of self-inquiry, and the Way, the noted translation of the Tao done by Mitchell.I liked how the book gave me greater insight into the four questions that Katie is best known for:* Is it true?  Can you absolutely know that itâ€™s true?How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought?Who would you be without the thought?In addition, I liked her use of real life examplesâ€“including this one:* I have questioned my thoughts, and Iâ€™ve seen that itâ€™s crazy to argue with what is. I donâ€™t ever want anything to happen except whatâ€™s happening. For example, my ninety-year-old mother is dying of pancreatic cancer. Iâ€™m taking care of her, cooking and cleaning for her, sleeping beside her, living in her apartment twenty-three hours a day (my husband takes me out for a walk every morning). It has been a month now. Itâ€™s as if her breath is the pulse of my life. I bathe her, I wash her in the most personal places, I medicate her, and I feel such a sense of gratitude. Thatâ€™s me over there, dying of cancer, spending my last few days sleeping and watching TV and talking, medicated with the most marvelous painkilling drugs. I am amazed at the beauty and intricacies of her body, my body.And this passage really got me thinking about how I view things:* When they believe their thoughts, people divide reality into opposites. They think that only certain things are beautiful. But to a clear mind, everything in the world is beautiful in its own way.Only by believing your own thoughts can you make the real unreal. If you donâ€™t separate reality into categories by naming it and believing that your names are real, how can you reject anything or believe that one thing is of less value than another? The mindâ€™s job is to prove that what it thinks is true, and it does that by judging and comparing this to that. What good is a this to the mind if it canâ€™t prove it with a that? Without proof, how can a this or a that exist?For example, if you think that only Mozart is beautiful, thereâ€™s no room in your world for rap. Youâ€™re entitled to your opinion, of course, but other people think that rap is where itâ€™s at. How do you react when you believe that rap is ugly? You grit your teeth when you hear it, and when you have to listen (maybe youâ€™re a parent or a grandparent), youâ€™re in a torture chamber. I love that when mind is understood, thereâ€™s room for rap as well as for Mozart. I donâ€™t hear anything as noise. To me, a car alarm is as beautiful as a bird singing. Itâ€™s all the sound of God.After listening to A THOUSAND NAMES FOR JOY, I now find myself wanting to read some of Katieâ€™s other books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32NDHOM2ZFF5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307339246#wasThisHelpful","R32NDHOM2ZFF5M","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WEIGHT LOSS SURGERY: THE REAL SKINNY (Obesity Resources Publishing) by Dr. Nick Nicholson and B. A. Blackwood is a short handbook for people who are considering or who have already undergone bariatric surgery.I donâ€™t fall into either category, but I nevertheless found this to be a very interesting book. It was also quite informative with respect to the mindset of those with weight issues.In particular, I liked how the authors quoted many of those individuals:* Most people have no idea how overweight they are until something bad or embarrassing happens. Itâ€™s as though your mindâ€™s eye protects you from seeing yourself as you really are up until the moment when your doctor tells you that you have diabetes or you see a photo of yourself at the company picnic.â€I was at a party with my husband and realized I was the biggest woman there, including a lady whoâ€™d had a baby just five days before.â€â€My friends and I had to walk a few blocks to get to a restaurant. By the time we got there I was sweaty and out of breath, and they were all fine. I was so embarrassed.â€â€I went to a meeting with potential clients and couldnâ€™t fit in the chair at the conference table. That was it for me.â€In addition, there was a great section at the end of the book that contained advice on things your mother should have told you, including these tidbits on food:* If your grandmother wouldnâ€™t recognize that thing youâ€™re about to put in your mouth as food, you shouldnâ€™t either.Shelf life for food is like a prison term. The longer it is, the worse it is for you.Junk food is just thatâ€“junk. Donâ€™t eat it.Your taste buds become sensitized after the first bite, so the first bite is the best bite. Everything after that is mostly your imagination.Watching your diet isnâ€™t restrictive. Itâ€™s liberating.You donâ€™t need a Ph.D. in nutrition to lose weight. Itâ€™s just calories in and calories out.And, lastly, I liked this quote from WEIGHT LOSS SURGERY that nicely summed up whatâ€™s really needed for bariatric surgery to be successful:* Your surgeon can operate on your stomach.

"I was intrigued by the idea behind FAILURE: THE SECRET TO SUCCESS (Method Press) by Robby Slaughter; i.e., we need to fail in order to get information about what to do next to become successful.The author then presents countess examples that help drive home his point. Among them:* Hiram ""Ulysses"" Grant's many accomplishments in life came as a result of being hardened by failure. His modest roots and long history of struggle prepared him for difficult trials. Grant's successes were preceded by many embarrassing failures. It was on the eve of what might have been the most devastating moment in his life that he was saved from total humiliation. The first day of the battle at Shiloh has been costly for the Union, and a prominent politician visited President Abraham Lincoln to call for Grant's dismissal. . . . Finally, sometime after 1 a.m., the President responded with a simple statement on the soldier's character and ability: ""I can't spare this man. He fights.""* [Michael] Jordan himself is fond of discussing the role of success and failure in his own career: I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And what's why I succeed.* J.K. Rowling, author of the hugely popular HARRY POTTER series, was invited to give the commencement address at Harvard University in 2008. .  . [She] opened her address by admitting her nervousness. She told herself and the crowed that she would take deep breaths. The famous writer then went on to explain how her own commencement speaker had been a course of great inspiration because Rowling couldn't remember a single word from that speech. ""This liberating discovery,"" stated the famous author, ""enables me to proceed without any feat that I might inadvertently influence you to abandon promising careers.""I had never quite thought about failure the way that Slaughter does in his excellent book.

In contrast, Perlmutter contends that modern dietary recommendations work out to be about 20% protein, 20% fat and 60% carbs.He goes on to claim that the dietary guidelines outlined in his book, which include eating no more than 50 grams of carbohydrates a day and the avoidance of most fruit, will positively affect a host of conditions, including ACHD, migraines, epilepsy, mod disorders and much more.In addition, he contends that carbs can destroy your brainâ€“even so-called healthy carbs like grains.

WHAT STOPS US FROM GIVING OUR BEST (Berrett-Koehler Publishers) by Harry Paul, John Britt and Ed Jent focuses on five qualities of excellence . . . and what you need to give and be your best in each of these five critical dimensions.This is done via an engaging parable, in which a kidnapping is committed . . . a team is then established that needs to work together to get the victim back, as well as to determine who is the culprit.As this is taking place, a delivery man by the name of Dave is brought into the picture . . . consequently, he begins to contemplate his own life and relationships.There were many interesting passages throughout the book; among them:* THE DOOLEY PHILSLOPHY: One should live oneâ€™s life seeing eery opportunity as new and exciting.Passion went on to explains that her dogâ€™s name was Dooley, and Dooley went out the same door several times a day to do his business and explore his backyard. â€œAnd if you could read Dooleyâ€™s body language,â€ she said, â€œAnd the way his eyes widen and his body trembles with anticipation, itâ€™s like the first time heâ€™s ever been out that door each and every time, and he canâ€™t wait to get out there and explore.â€* THE LAW OF EXCELLENCE: Keep a constant aware and vigilance to always be your best with Passion, Competency, Flexibility, Communications and Ownership.And my favorite one that told of the passing of Jack Paul, Harryâ€™s father:* Instead [at his funeral], I spoke about how Jack taught us that we all could make someoneâ€™s life a little brighter, and I shared with them story of how he made the coffee taste better. Afterward, many people came up to me, including his fellow employees, customers and caregivers who felt compelled to be there because Jack had much such a difference in their lives. Not only did he bring some joy to them, but he also gave them a fresh perspective on how precious life is and that we all that the ability and responsibility to make another personâ€™s life a little brighter.

"Heard WINNING EVERY TIME: HOW TO USE THE SKILLS OF A LAWYER IN THE TRIALS OF LIFE (Random House Audio), written and read by Lis Wiehl.The author, a former federal  prosecutor and popular legal commentator, explains how to make use of lawyerly thinking in everyday life. She shows how this can be helpful in such situations as  as getting a raise, communicating better with your partner or becoming a more effective parent.The key is to utilize the following eight easy-to-use rules of persuasion:Know What You Want: The Theory of the Case-outline your premise clearly and establish your objective accordingly. Choose and Cultivate Your Audience: Voir Dire- bring your case to the person who â€œcalls the shotsâ€ and know the perfect time and place to do so. Marshal Your Evidence: Discovery-assemble all the facts that support your cause, even information that may challenge your objective. Advocate with Confidence: Making the Case-present your opening argument and offer your evidence calmly and methodically. Counter the Claims: Cross-examination-challenge your opponentâ€™s allegations consistently, but gently, through a series of â€œyes or noâ€ questions. Stay True to Your Case: Avoid the Seven Deadly Spins-keep your argument authentic by avoiding false inferences, hearsay, and subjectivity. Advocate with Heart: Let Me Tell You a Story-make your case personal with a special story that will convey your message in a memorable way. Sum It Up: The Closing Argument-deliver a fervent and succinct summation of your theory and evidence . . . and close the deal.I liked how she gave examples of the above from her professional experience, as well as from such high profile trials as O.J. Simplsonâ€™s. In the latter, she contends, the lesson is that one must present a story of the case thatâ€™s based on fact and reasoning, rather than appearing pushy and aggressive to a jury. In another instance, she detailed how a frustrated father got his son to do nightly homework by keeping emotions in check and maintaining control of the discussionâ€“something thatâ€™s often easier said than done.If youâ€™re not a lawyer, but would like to know how to do so when the need arises, then WINNING  is the book for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK6DBSI8IO6JQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345469208#wasThisHelpful","RK6DBSI8IO6JQ","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A TWIST OF LYME (Archway Publishing) by Andrea H. Caesar is the true story of a woman who contracted Lyme disease as a child, but did not have it diagnosed until she was 36.It presents an almost day-by-day account of what this entailed. The account is funny, at spots, but harrowing in many others. And overall, the tale is a very moving one.The author provides many useful suggestions along the way; among them:  * One thing I had done, that I suggest anyone dealing with chronic illness does, is to walk in armed with an entire life health history written out, as well as a complete list of medications and dosages. Doing this allowed me to take control of my own health and showed them (and other doctors since) that I am in control of my information and am ready to be approached as a serious patient.And:* Listen. Itâ€™s the best thing you can do for someone like me. Itâ€™s really a skill that most people never truly learn. I donâ€™t need anyone on a soap box. Just be there for me. Just listen. Just notice me. And if itâ€™s too depressing for you, then donâ€™t feel you need to offer hope. Just walk away. Because that is what I need right now. I donâ€™t need people who are uncomfortable around me. I just need someone to sit beside me and get it. Play Scrabble with me. Just know that I am where I am it blows and thatâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s part of my path, my lesson. I need a friend right now. I just wish I knew who that friend was, because right now itâ€™s Mini and itâ€™s certainly too much for her to bear.What was especially scary was the amount of money that the author has had to pay for her treatment:* Iâ€™m not even going to begin to try to come up with the amount of money my family has spent over the years trying to diagnose and treat me. I am afraid to even think about it.  I am pretty sure I could buy a nice house in cash with that sum. But letâ€™s get a little real, just in case there is some person of influence out there who cares about how lives are being ruined by chronic Lyme.By the end of the book, Caesar was finally making progress in her attempt to get better. She is not there completely, but she is on her way.

It takes 55,000 miles of flight to reach this many flowersâ€“a little more than twice the Earthâ€™s circumference.And I enjoyed learning about how to coexist with bees, and how they can actually help you in many waysâ€“such as the following:* Bees make honey from the flowers and flowering plants that are within a 3 to 5 radius of their hive. If you suffer from spring allergies, try eating honey from your area, as this is known to alleviate allergy symptoms.I also liked the various quotes throughout the book, including this one:The bee is more honored than other animals, not because she labors, but because she labors for others.â€“Saint John ChrysostomKudos to John Autry for his vibrant photographs that added to my enjoyment of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YWJUQXFN0NK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612120512#wasThisHelpful","R1YWJUQXFN0NK","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heard HITCH 22: A MEMOIR (Hachette Audio), written and ready by Christopher Hitchins.Hitchins, who died in 2011, was a  British-American author and journalist who was known as a man with unbending convictions that often seemed contraditory; e.g., he was opposed to the war in Vietnam and yet he supported invention in Iraq.He spends an inordinate amount of time on his youth in this book, and I felt there was way too much name-dropping.Also, I donâ€™t think Hitchinsâ€™ narration was particularly well done.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1URHV4L28Z3SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=044654034X#wasThisHelpful","R1URHV4L28Z3SC","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE SECRETS OF BUSINESS (Ehabâ€™s Books and Media Publishing, Inc) by Ehab Atalla tells how he went from being a broke, immigrant cashier to establishing 34 businesses in 15 different industries.The book starts slowly, but then picks up as he starts describing what he has doneâ€“and why it has worked (at least most of the time).Among the useful ideas I picked up were these:* If youâ€™re a surgeon, you are limited to how many surgeries you can do per week because you canâ€™t be in two places at once and you only have two hands. Since there is only so much time you can work, your income can become limited.If youâ€™re a professional, you need to invest your income smartly if you wish to free up your time. I know doctors, for instance, who buy the office building where they work. This allows them to collect income from other tenants and grow their wealth. They make additional money this way without spending more of their time working.* Any situation has numerous ways for you to leverage it. Letâ€™s say, for example, you take an educational class. The benefits of taking a class are obvious-getting an education and developing skills. But what else can you leverage that is not so obvious? Take a moment to think about how many birds you can kill with one stone by taking a class. Can you come up with more than five?Besides just listening to the professor, you can take advantage of expanding your network by meeting all of your classmates. Suppose you take four classes in one semester, and each class has 50 people in it; thatâ€™s 200 new people you can meet every semester. Two hundred new people you can share ideas with and study with. Through interacting with your classmates, you will come across new ideas and perspectives that will lead to opportunities or maybe even a new business.And I especially liked this one:* I found out that if I have a serious problem that I cannot find a solution for, or if I need to create a business plan, I can program my mind to work on these tasks while I sleep. Before I go to bed, I think very intensely and deeply about the problem. I visualize all parts of the problem and what the solution should look like. Then, while I am falling asleep, I continue thinking about the problem and solution. Why? Because I want to fall asleep thinking about what I want to solve or create: I want to force my subconscious to think for me while I sleep. Try this technique for yourself. I found that when I do this, in the morning I come up with the solution, goal, or plan. Or, I wake up suddenly in the middle of the night with the answer I am looking for.THE SECRETS OF BUSINESS was a bit light on specifics. However, I was impressed by an Appendix that showed many of the legal documents that backed up the authorâ€™s claims of success.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SMNG8HRDXNMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989473805#wasThisHelpful","R3SMNG8HRDXNMO","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"MATH DOESNâ€™T SUCK: HOW TO SURVIVE MIDDLE SCHOOL MATH WITHOUT LOSING YOUR MAIL OR BREAKING A LEG (Hudson Street Press) by Danica McKellar shows that math can be both easy and relevant. It also provides girl readers with the tools to do better on their next exam.The author, best known for her roles on THE WONDER YEARS AND THE WEST WING, is also an internationally recognized mathematician and advocate for math education. She is even coauthor of a groundbreaking mathematical physics theorem, the Charles-McKellar-Winn Theorem, which bears her name.There are many tips that I regret having never been taught;  for example:* Because the numerators and denominators of big, scary fractions can get complicated, this is a good time to review the order of operation. For me, remembering the phrase â€œPlease Excuse My Deer Aunt Sallyâ€ always helped me to remember the order: â€œParentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.â€I also liked her examples using Reality Math, such as this one:* Say youâ€™re burning a DVD of a bunch of home-video minimovies that youâ€™ve recorded with your digital camera. Theyâ€™re really cute. Youâ€™ve been documenting every week of your new puppyâ€™s life with a minimovie dedicated to him. Heâ€™s 9 months old now, so you have a lot of weeks stored up!Each movie takes up about 26.5 MB of space on the DVD. Youâ€™ve also burned a bunch of puppy pictures onto the DVD, so thereâ€™s only about 848 MB of free space left. How many of these 26.5 MB mini movies do you have room for on the DVD. . . . But waitâ€“how do we divide when a decimal point is in the divisor? (If you donâ€™t have a calculator handy, that is.)Note: The book then proceeds to show you how to do this.Lastly, I thought the Troubleshooting Guide after the last chapter was particularly valuable. This one â€œcheerleadingâ€ idea, taught by McKellarâ€™s SAT tutor, really struck me as helpful:* She said, â€œI know many of these stories are not interesting to you, but you need to read them closely, paying attention to their details, so hereâ€™s what I suggest: as youâ€™re reading them, pretend like theyâ€™re the most fascinating thing youâ€™ve ever read.â€I thought she was insane. But I tried it. I sat there  reading these boring paragraphs and thinking pretend thoughts like, â€œWow. I just love ant farms. How many cubic inches do the ants burrow on an average per day. Fascinating. Tell me more about the different types of ants!â€The only thing that could have made MATH DOESNâ€™T SUCK better would have been if it had also been written for boys . . . one can hope that will be the case with the authorâ€™s next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N8EPKAU7E7RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452289491#wasThisHelpful","R2N8EPKAU7E7RF","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A YEAR TO LIVE: HOW TO LIVE THIS YEAR AS IF IT WERE YOUR LAST (Bell Tower) by Stephen Levine teaches us to live each moment, each hour, each day mindfully--as if it were all that was left.The author decided to live this way for a whole year, and he shares his experiences in this thought-provoking book.I liked his many examples of how others have managed to apply this concept, including this one:* One day in San Francisco, a dentist friend, while working on my teeth, told me that it was his fiftieth birthday. ""Well then, just ten more years to live, to really live? I joked through the nitrous oxide. Knowing his delight in physical sport, I floated the possibility that his body might have only another ten years of the energy and stamina necessary for his favorite endeavors, backpacking and wild-river rafting. Though I was only half-kidding, and fifty-five years old myself at the time, he was apparently ripe to hear this, and a few months later changed his office hours to a four-day week, finalized his divorce, and bought a new pair of skis. I have never seen him so lighthearted as when he speaks about how much more time he has to live by giving himself one extra day each week. Now the game is to remind him not to overbook those four days. Clearly we reclaim our lives one step at a time.Levine also raises many questions that had me reflecting on just what I would do:*Too many bad movies have left us with a penchant for fantasizing our own famous lastwords. . . . We have whispered, just loud enough for all those gathered around the bed to hear, magnificent salutations, witty repartee, and poetic conclusions. But what words would you actually utter as you expelled your last breath?And though I'm not typically a practitioner of meditation, I thought the followingmakes a lot of sense:* Sit quietly for a while and bring to mind someone from your past whose kindness touched your heart. Envision yourself speaking to that person. Tell them what they have meant to you. Send your gratitude to them as though your hearts were connected. Thank them, and when the conversation ends, bid them farewell. Say good-bye to them as if you might never see them again, even in memory.Bring to mind, one by one, and without haste, the friends, teachers, parents, ancestors, comrades, lovers and even pets with whom you feel a kinship, those who have supported the growth of your heart. Tell them how much you appreciate their care and kindness. Send gratitude into their image. When love has filled the space between you and it is time to depart, say good-bye as if you might never be this way again.I have actually started using the above and that alone has made A YEAR TO LIVE a book that I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38X37EH05LQ8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0609801945#wasThisHelpful","R38X37EH05LQ8Y","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Joey Asher,  a professional communication and selling skills coach, is rapidly becoming one of my favorite authors . . . Two of his previous books, 15 MINUTES INCLUDING Q&A and EVEN A GEEK CAN SPEAK, had provided me with much useful information . . . and so did the one I just finished: HOW TO WIN A PITCH; THE FIVE FUNDAMENTAL THAT WILL DISTINGUISH YOU FROM THE COMPETITION (Persuasive Speaker Press).What I liked best about it were the many examples that were used to reinforce the points the author was making . . . for example, he shows you exactly what to do when first meeting  a potential customer:* The goal of the overview is to take control of the meeting, give the prospect a brief overview of what your firm does, and demonstrate that you have a plan that will not waste the clientâ€™s time.Start with some light banter. â€œIs that a photograph of you and Tony Bennett?â€ Just donâ€™tâ€™ go too far with the chit chat. A couple of minutes are fine, but too much schmoozing can be irritating, especially when youâ€™re taking up the prospectâ€™s time. Give the sense that youâ€™re there to find a way to help them. Redirect the conversation to the topic at hand: the prospectâ€™s needs.Hereâ€™s what you might say:â€Thank you for letting me meet with you. Our software firm helps banks build auto-loan portfolios. We do that with our software platform, as well as our consulting services. As I mentioned, weâ€™re giving you a presentation in a week or so, and we want to make sure that the presentation is on target. So, if itâ€™s okay with you, Iâ€™d like to ask some questions.â€I also liked the many stories that were used, including this one:* I once heard a story about how Rick Pitino, the basketball coach, became a great recruiter of high school athletes. Rather than going into the high school athleteâ€™s living room and talking about his schoolâ€™s benefits, heâ€™d sit down with the athlete and ask something like, â€œSo tell me what youâ€™re looking for in a college experience.â€ The student would then tell him what was most important to him: education, a fun campus environment, a particular type of academic program. Based on those conversations, Pitino would then know how to position his college in the athleteâ€™s mind. It was by listening that he made the sale and became a successful recruiter.And though there were many tidbits that Iâ€™ll long remember, the following especially got me thinking:* I worked with a management consultant who wanted me to help him pitch for an opportunity. He did a nice job of discovery and had a twelve-point plan for fixing his clientâ€™s business.â€œI think we need to get this presentation down to a three core message,â€ I told him.Nevertheless, he was stuck on his twelve-point plan. He had carefully worked out how, in twelve steps, he was going to improve the processes within the clientâ€™s business and save them lots of money.â€œBut no one is going to remember twelve points,â€ I told him. Indeed, people wonâ€™t remember more than three or four points.He claimed that it was just impossible to present fewer than twelve points. So I said, â€œWell, what if I took out a gun and threatened you? Could you get it to three in that case?â€â€œIf you put it that way,â€ he said, â€œI guess I could do it.â€ We were able to distill his presentation to the three most important parts of his plan in no time at all.Getting your presentation down to three points is not that hard and it allows you to have a huge impact on your audience. It allows you to be sure that they remember your message. That is critical if you want to win a pitch.If youâ€™re involved on needing to win new business, Iâ€™d strongly recommend that you win HOW TO WIN A PITCH.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39F07BAPVURI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0978577612#wasThisHelpful","R39F07BAPVURI1","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This book is for them. I want them to know that broadcast journalism was established by someone with the highest standards. Tabloid crime stories, so much a part of the lust for ratings by today's news broadcasters held no interest for Murrow. He did like Hollywood celebrities; they had no place on his news programs. My book is focused on this life in journalism. I offer it in the hope that more people in and out of the news business will get to know Ed Murrow. Perhaps in time the descent from Murrow's principles can be reversed.""I was fascinated to learn how Murrow reported on the London Blitz, bombing raids over Berlin and the McCarthy hearings. In addition, I enjoyed following the account of his constant battles with CBS.

"LEAP LIFE (KCCUSA) by Keith Challenger is a slim book  that promises, via its subtitle, to be YOUR PRACTICAL GUIDE TO LACK OF TIME MANAGEMENT.The author, a popular speaker and consultant, did not just write another time management book . . . instead, he effectively presents ideas on how we both use and abuse our most precious resource--and what can be done about this.For example, he notes:* A good rule of thumb when you encounter a situation that upsets or frustrates you is to begin by asking yourself if there's anything you can do to change it. If the answer is ""No"" then you have to accept it and move on. This is tough and it takes practice, persistence and self-discipline, none of which is a strong suit for me. Even if the answer is ""Yes"" you may decide that it's not worth the time and effort to do anything about it. Either way, how you react or feel about it is your choice.I also liked his use of examples, including this one involving a woman by the name of Mary who was faced with a problem:*While there might be no foolproof way to adopt the lack of time management strategy keys into your life, there is a good starting point. Instead of focusing on how you feel about the demands on your time, begin instead to focus on what you can do about those demands. In other words, begin to think in terms of solutions rather than problems --in the same way that Mary was challenged to do in the ""two solutions"" scenario.And I personally like any book that cites my friend Brian Biro, known as ""America's Breakthrough Coach, who uses a mantra that Challenger also uses in his life:* What you FOCUS on is what you CREATE.Not what you get, but what you create. The things that you get in life often come as the result of circumstances beyond your control or influence. But the things you create come from your actions (or omissions). This wonderful phrase is a remarkable reminder the next time you feel overwhelmed by deadlines, responsibilities and demands, that the key elements of your lack of time Management strategy are an excellent way to put you back in control.LEAP LIFE will only take you a few hours, at most, to read . . . but if you're like me, you'll find yourself thinking about it long after you've put it down . . . and also, it is a book you'll want to revisit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UYRPJUR27RH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8IBM8S#wasThisHelpful","R5UYRPJUR27RH","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Often, it is because they have an invisible Code of Honor that holds them together under pressure.TEAM CODE OF HONOR goes on to present many examples of how to create your own Code of Honor, as well as how to implement it.

"CHIMES FROM A CRACKED SOUTHERN BELLE (Grateful Steps Foundation) by Susan Reinhardt is a novel about a woman who is nearly murdered by her ex.Much of it is very funny, but there are parts of it that are also very touching. And I was always left wondering what would happen next to Dee Millings, the main character.The author's writing style kept me engrossed throughout the book. I found myself writing notes about many of them, thinking that I'd want to include them in this review.  Among the more memorable passages were the following:* ""Are you out of your mind? You are going nowhere, Miss Gloom, I've had four people give me directions as I was hunting for you just now. They want me there. Once you make it to the hole in the ground, you are good to go for the covered dish. Only those who watch the dead go down get the buffet afterward. It's the reward for attending, sweet Prude, and probably the only one you'll get, since I couldn't ring that man for you. He canceled at the last minute, damned fool.""* But even with their quirks and misguided priorities, South Carolinians are warm and gracious, typical Southerners who will give neighbors everything out of their cabinets or gardens but won't wince if a time comes that a neighbor must be properly put in her place. Vengeance is as alive as repentance, and quite often the two hold hands.And this one:* ""You sure can. Now, just tell me how you can advertise fresh homemade food when all I put in my mouth was Campbell's or Stokely's, maybe even the cheaper stuff like Margaret Holme's unseasoned offerings. Explain all this to me,"" she said as he stood transfixed, eyes darting about to see how many customers were listening to my aunt's rant. ""Explain, please, and while you're at it, tell my why you haven't trained these poor waitresses to serve people. This is the most unorganized place I've ever set me size-6 feet in. Why, my husband can cook better than this and he serves hairballs!""You may think CHIMES is a book just for women, but if you do, you'll be missing a novel that just about anybody will enjoy . . . and I dare you not to laugh out loud when reading about Dee's attempt to provide CPR for a squirrel, as well her aunt's many visits to crash weddings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NG0HVEF8755U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935130625#wasThisHelpful","R1NG0HVEF8755U","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heard SINGIFYING RAPPERS (Hachette Audio), written by David Foster Wallace and Mark Costello and narrated by Robert Petkoff.It is a rerelease of the same 1990 book by the authors, updated with a new foreword by Costello on his experience writing with  Wallace.The authors based much of their work, which is actually a longish essay, on their experiences hanging out with owners of a small rap company in Boston. They claim to be the first whites to appreciate its political radicalness and artistic value, calling rap ""quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today.""SIGNIFYING RAPPERS might well now be considered to be outdated, but that's not the case if you view it as history lesson of a movement that has survived all these years.

"ANCIENT SECRETS OF LEAD GENERATION: YOUR PRIMITIVE GUIDE TO BETTER LEADS WITH LESS EFFORT (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) by Daryl Urbanski is a slim book packed with lots of useful ideas for growing your business--regardless of field.He discusses various strategies, such as free samples, banner ads, articles, etc., and then shows you how to test them.I especially liked this one tidbit from the book:* How often does price come up when your friends call you to go for lunch, a drink or even to go camping for the weekend? Is the main focus on cost? Not likely.In addition, I liked this other question he raised:* ""If you have the world's greatest product/service and no one is there to experience it, does it help anyone to live better or make you any money?""Just make sure you treat people right, deliver on your promises and do everything in your power to keep you customers from leaving.The author then goes on to explain:* The money is not in DOING what your business does. It's in SELLING what your business can do for people--and making sure those people walk away happy.Lastly, Urbanski practices what he writes about as evidenced by the offer he makes for free training videos, audios and forms.

"Heard BALANCE: A STORY OF FAITH, FAMILY AND LIFE ON THE LINE (Hachette Audio), written by Nik Wallenda with David Ritz and read by Steve Gibbons.It's the thrilling story of high wire artist Wallenda who when he was four years old, watched a video from 1978 of his great grandfather, Karl Wallenda, walking between the towers of the Condado Plaza Hotel in Puerto Rico, stumbling, and falling to his death because of a faulty balance pole. Nik  then heard his father quote his great-grandfather, ""Life is on the wire, everything else is just waiting,"" and he vowed to be just like the words resonated deep within his soul and he vowed to become just like Karl Wallenda.The first half of the book recounts the author's childhood and upbringing, and the second half focuses on Nik's more recent exploits. Most thrilling was his account of how he became the first person ever to walk across Niagara Falls. I was especially impressed by the fact that shortly thereafter, he spent three hours cleaning up trash left by the crowd.BALANCE also presents an interesting behind-the-scenes view of what circus life is all about-including the economics of the profession.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R147A358667RYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455545511#wasThisHelpful","R147A358667RYW","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm generally an upbeat kind of guy and consider myself a positive thinker . . . so when I came across THE ANTIDOTE: HAPPINESS FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T STAND POSITIVE THINKING (Canongate Books) by Oliver Burkeman, I was intrigued by the premise.The author contends that trying too hard to be happy is making us miserable. In fact, he presents many interesting examples in this book that may well be considered as a celebration of the power of negative thinking. Among them:* [Attending a motivational seminar featuring Dr. Robert Schuler] *Here it is, then,"" Dr. Schuller declares, stiffly pacing the stage, which is decorated with two enormous banners reading ""MOTIVATE"" and ""SUCCEED!"", seventeen American flags, and a large number of potted plants. ""Here's the thing that will change your life forever."" Then he barks a single syllable-""Cut!""-and leaves a dramatic pause before completing his sentence:  "" . . . the word impossible out of your life! Cut it off! Cut it out forever!"" . . .It is only months later, back at my home in New York, reading the headlines over morning coffee, that I learn the news that the largest church in the United States constructed entirely from glass has filed for bankruptcy, a word Dr. Schuller had apparently neglected to eliminate from his vocabulary.I also liked how he cited the work of Albert Ellis:* What Ellis had grasped about his unstated beliefs concerning conversation with women-an insight he would later extend to the beliefs that lie behind all instances of worry or anxiety-is that they were absolutist. To put it another way, it wasn't just that he wanted to be less shy, and that he wanted to be able to talk to women. Rather, he had been operating under the absolutist conviction that he needed their approval. Later, he would coin a name for this habit of mind: ""musturbation."" We elevate those things we want, those things we would prefer to have, into things we believe we must have; we feel we must perform well in certain circumstances, or that other people must treat us well. Because we think these things must occur, it follows that it would be an absolute catastrophe if they did not. No wonder we get anxious: we've decided that if we failed to meet our goal it wouldn't merely be bad, but completely bad-absolutely terrible.And Burkeman shared this neat way of behaving at funerals:* Francisco parked the van, and we walked into the cemetery. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to what I was seeing. Many of the gravestones were only rough concrete slabs, or stubby pieces of wood, but almost none were unattached. Next to each, sitting in folding chairs, or cross-legged on the ground, were groups of two, three, or four people, sometimes more, holding murmured conversations and drinking tequila from paper cups. In one corner, a mariachi band in full costume strolled from grave to grave, serenading every headstone in turn. I stopped a woman who was carrying armfuls of rugs and chairs towards a nearby headstone, and asked what she was doing. ""Oh, it's my mother,"" she said brightly, gesturing at the grave. ""We come every year.""I don't think that THE ANTIDOTE has made me a negative thinker. However, it has made me open to the possibility that there are many different ways to look at happiness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K9TUUUYUQWKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0865479410#wasThisHelpful","R2K9TUUUYUQWKW","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are ultimately empty.* People not positions are a leader's most valuable asset. It takes no time to let others know that you value them.* If somebody on your team can do a task as well or better than you can, give him or her responsibility for it.* Helping others grow and develop brings great joy to any leader.* Helping others develop their potential enables leaders to become world class.* If you've become successful, it's only because a lot of people have helped you along the way.I've enjoyed several other books by Maxwell with respect to leadership.

"BLIND CURVES: ONE WOMAN'S UNUSUAL JOURNEY TO REINVENT HERSELF AND ANSWER: WHAT NOW? (Opus Intl.) by Linda Crill is an engaging book about a former corporate executive who lost her husband to cancer. To shake things up, she learns to ride a motorcycle in just four weeks and then heads out on a 2,500-mile trip down America's Pacific Coast Highway.It felt like I was part of the author's learning curve every stop of the way . . . what she went through also got me thinking about my life; for example when she observed:* In most of life, I take living for granted and assume I have plenty of time to accomplish anything I want to do. Since time seems so bountiful, it's easy to waste it doing nothing. How often have I spent a whole evening in front of boring television, eating unsatisfying junk food, feeling sluggish and dull? In moments like these, life is cheap and its exquisite value unappreciated. But at times when I am pushing life to its limits, there is recognition of the volatility of life. In these moments life is priceless. The present moment, all moments, become sacred. Full attention is paid to each second-to each detail. Nothing is missed or unexamined.In addition, I'm now rethinking my future vacations because of the following tidbit:* Arthur Frommer said in his travel books that the purpose of a vacation is to provide contrast. To me the best vacations were the ones that offered a change in weather, location, activity, food and routine. This vacation had certainly succeeded in doing that. I had chosen a radical departure from my solitary life. For the past nine days, I had spent few moments alone.And I was especially touched by how Crill described the love story that was her marriage:* Two hours later my name was called over the loudspeaker, and I was escorted to Bill's bed in post-op. He was still groggy from sedation, but it was reassuring to see him. I instantly relaxed, leaned over his bed's side guard, touched his arm, kissed him and told him I loved him.Bill smiled up at me.After a brief conversation he asked, ""So what did they find? Is it a virus like we thought?""Shocked that no one had told him the results of his surgery, I tried to disguise my inner panic. It was up to me to deliver the diagnosis no one ever wants to receive or report. I knew Bill would not want me to tiptoe around the truth so I told him as gently as I could.""The doctor said it's cancer, probably mesothelioma."" I awaited his response, unable to predict his reaction.He pondered for a moment, then smiled up at me and smiled up at me and said, ""but I haven't had my fifteen minutes yet.""""What?"" I said.""I haven't had my fifteen minutes yet.""""What?"" I asked again, still not comprehending Bill's answer.""Everyone's supposed to have their fifteen minutes of fame before they die. I haven't had mine yet. ""Even if you're not a motorcycle enthusiast, you'll like BLIND CURVES. The accompanying illustrations by Kevin Miller will add to your enjoyment of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUOPBYBXOAVJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098589850X#wasThisHelpful","RUOPBYBXOAVJZ","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THANK YOU FOR LISTENING: GAIN INFLUENCE & IMPROVE RELATIONSHIPS, BETTER LISTENING IN 8 STEPS (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform) by Marc Wong contains practical advice that will enable you to be a good audience and contribute to a conversation, as well as show you how to provide support and encouragement.The author brings in examples from such diverse fields as movies, poker and women's shows, and these help to bring home such points as the following:  * When a physician listens respectfully, and ask questions and picks up on clues, patients tend to be more involved in their care, more open about what's wrong, and better informed and more satisfied with their visit. Satisfied patients also have fewer hospitalizations, doctor visits and lab tests.* Philosophical questions aside, if you tell a joke and nobody laughs, then you know how it feels not be heard. Of course, your joke or perhaps your delivery might not have been perfect. Nevertheless, your sentiment was not acknowledged or shared. If you think you have a great sense of humor, but your spouse never laughs at your jokes, then you know how frustrating it is to never to be heard. You feel unappreciated. The other person doesn't ""get"" you. You don't feel validated.Wong also provides several insightful exercises, including this one:* Try to pick an unusual topic. See if you can come up with some good questions about this topic. For starters, choose situations in which you stand to gain by developing rapport. For example, if you're on a first date or with a new client and she mentions kites or bonsai, what questions would you ask to get her to elaborate on the subject?As a listener, we should also be aware that people exaggerate. Sometimes we exaggerate for comedic effect.  All the ""Your mother is fat..."" jokes are based on exaggeration. We also exaggerate to highlight our frustration. ""I'm going to quit this stupid job and go join a circus!"" ""I'm going to hit the next person who says 'paradigm' or 'think outside the box'!"" We're not necessarily going to join the circus or hit anyone. We just feel so frustrated that we want to do those things. If we're allowed to talk freely about the reasons for our frustrations, we'll most likely calm down and forget about the exaggerated threats.We learn many things in school, but rarely is listening taught. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING may well help you fill that gap in your education.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AODAMM7L5KIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1475043147#wasThisHelpful","R2AODAMM7L5KIK","A2HM0BZWQRV1EF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM0BZWQRV1EF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If this toaster didn't have a window I probably wouldn't buy it, but I definitely wouldn't bother replacing it.  It's a good toaster, fancy red color, cool touch exterior, and window notwithstanding.  Ah, but it has a window!I've always wished I had a toaster with a window, and while my dreams or world peace and more leg room on airplanes have generally been ignored, we now have this.  To be honest it's a little anticlimactic, and the toast toasts so fast, it's not like it makes that much of a difference, but it's there.  The ceramic tubes do a good job of not only toasting bread but doing so in a relatively even manner, and the plastic exterior stays cool under most home toasting scenarios (use it 3-4 times in a row and watch out).It's been a while since I've used a toaster (somehow I got on the toaster over path), and I forgot how much better these dedicated units toast.  You give up some flexibility in regards to bread size, but it accepts most bread stuffs.You can't go wrong with this model, but it's not quite toasting nirvana if you want to try something else.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23R7WV62CNC0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGCKZNE#wasThisHelpful","R23R7WV62CNC0R","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Stuhrling Original watch for a few years now (yeah those cheap automatics can last while--albeit with quirks), and after getting the crocodile strap I added to it wet one too many times, it started getting a little gamey.

It's navy as indicated in the title (kinda wished for royal, but it looks good).  No instructions or pins were included, so keep your old ones handy (or order more).  The hardest part was removing my old strap. Once that was out, you put the pins in sans strap and thread it through (there are tons of guides out there).  The strap barely slide through the gap between the pin and case, but it works and I don't feel there's undue pressure being applied.  The whole process tool less than five minutes with 3-4 of that being spent removing the old strap.The length is good (I have a largish wrist), and it has ample holes for smaller wrists and a means to deal with extra slack.  There are no frays or other defects, and the stitching seems good.  I don't anticipate any issues, but if there are any, I'll update this review.

"This is a lot to pay for a rock tumbler, but ...This is by far the best model I found complete with all of the bells and whistles, and is quiet (and gets quieter as the stones smooth out) to boot.

The real benefit comes with interacting with your kids (or whomever you partake in this with), experiencing the science, and the thrill of the reveal.  As noted in the Q&A section, you can use any rocks (up to a certain size) and grit.

"This worked beautifully in replacing cracked glass on a 13"" Macbook Pro (~2010).  My only advice is to remember that the rubber gasket around the existing glass will become easily damaged by metal tools especially with heat.The glass panel arrived securely packed and free of any blemishes.  The back (seen in the pics) peels off easily and the attached tape secures it to the frame.  Be sure to have the frame ready (I heated it a little prior to mounting the glass to help adhesion) and free of the old tape, glass, or other debris.  You'll be rewarded.Just about anyone can replace the glass, but don't be surprised if it's a little intimidating.

"Other than the iPad Pro, iPads aren't exactly meant for keyboards, and the Mini is probably the worst case scenario.  It's not that people don't need keyboards or can't use them (otherwise this wouldn't be needed), but the deck is stack against device makers like Zagg.Despite that, I see this as a success.  It pairs easily and quickly and is quick to resynch.  It's not quite as natural as a dedicated keyboard ALA Asus Transformer or Microsoft Surface, but you don't miss out on much.  iOS begrudgingly accepts Bluetooth keyboards, and you get everything else you love about iPads along with a keyboard.  The Mini creates another challenge due to its size.  Zagg has done the best they can with a tight layout, and it;s not too hard to get used to, though it'll never be as natural or as fast for me as a full keyboard.  It really shines when used by kids, who are just as likely to use an iPad as a PC, and the size of the keyboard (and iPad Mini) suits them.Other things to consider: the case secures to the iPad nicely and the included kickstand is quite nice.  It almost makes for a modern netbook like experience, though iOS is snappier than any netbook I've used.  While I imagine you could pair this with just about any Bluetooth device (without the whole case experience), I've yet to try that.In general I'd recommend an iPad Air if typing on an iPad is expected to be a primary use, but if you want a keyboard for an iPad Mini, I'd strongly consider this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5LSYN1UQ6T1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0171E5R0K#wasThisHelpful","R5LSYN1UQ6T1Y","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've acquired quite a few devices, and they all have Bluetooth.  Most however lack a keyboard, so this is quite convenient.First off it pairs easily with everything (Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, Windows 8.1 HTPC, and Samsung Note 5), and it's easy to switch between all of the devices while remaining paired.  With those two features, I'd deal with a bad keyboard and other hassles.  It doesn't have a bad keyboard--actually it's better than I expected.  I wouldn't say it's great, but the key spacing and travel make using it natural.  When using with a Windows PC (or Mac) note that this is just a keyboard and you'll probably need a mouse, but for my HTPC, all I need is a keyboard (to do occasional searches where using the remote is a pain).  I haven't reached the end of the range, and given the uses this is designed for, range won't be an issue.  Speaking of those uses, the ability to prop up a phone or tablet makes this much more useful, and while the keyboard is larger than most tablets, it's not likely to be too big for class or travel.  It's not the most robust device, but I didn't feel the need to be overly concerned about wear and tear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R239WWES7LXUM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016QO5N1O#wasThisHelpful","R239WWES7LXUM2","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to doubt the speed of my AV600 kit.  It doesn't.  It's hard to say what the issue is, and I get that turning electrical wiring into ethernet is magic in itself.  I did get 25-40% bump in speed, and if I were buying one, I'd get the Power Line 1200 with the pass through. This works, but you'll need a separate power strip, and it will need a particular kind of plug (most will do, but some angled ones will cause issues).  As with all of the TP-LINK gear, it's easy to setup, as well as secure (optional but recommended).  The connection is stable, and all in all I'm rather satisfied, but I'm left wanting a bit more of a bump in speed.Another thing to consider is whether or not one device is all that needs ether.  This (and all of the other Power Line gear) works well enough as a bridge, but you may still need a switch or an access point to serve more devices.  Of course you can add a switch or access point, but when you combine that with the possibility of needing a power strip (which may need room to plug the access point and or switch into), all of a sudden you got a lot going on.  None of this is a negative as much as an item to consider.  They make ones with a switch, but those are slower; likewise there are Power Line equipped access points, but they are older.Anyway, this works, and it works well.  It could be faster, but it handles high bit rate 1080p fine, and I'd get the 1200--just the version with the pass through.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N3QKD7N20IL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7NJWOM#wasThisHelpful","R2N3QKD7N20IL2","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's kinda ironic that this is pictured on a MacBook Pro, a product from a company know to put aesthetic design at a premium even over usability and definitely over cost.  It's ironic because the GeekOut V2 looks like a homemade creation of a mad scientist that you bought at the flea market!  Perhaps a middle ground would have been best.Looks aside, it sounds great and like any other USB amp/DAC, it's plug and play.  The only real setting is the hi/low current setting to drive large cans that have higher resistance and avoid blowing out earbuds.  Everything sounds amazing whether I'm using my Ultimate Ears TripleFi in ear monitors or my Audio Technica Sonic Pro over the ear headphones.  Top quality FLAC sources have a richer feel than 128kps MP3s, but the added clarity and warmth still enhances the MP3s.  In short I wouldn't buy this purely to make Pandora sound better, but it kinda does.  The audio quality on FLAC sources makes this worthwhile.The biggest knock is the homemade 3d printed shell.

"I got this as a perk for completing a bunch of training from Intel (one of the few nice things about computer retail), and until that moment, I didn't even know Intel made liquid coolers.They don't really make these, as it's a licensed Asetek clone, that Asetek (or whoever they have build their systems) makes.  That's not a bad thing.  What you get is a complete setup for Intel CPUs LGA115x, LGA1366, LGA2011, which is pretty much anything folks buy these days.  One of the benefits of being an Asetek clone is all of the compatible mounts (not included but available), so yeah you could even put this on an AMD CPU or a video card.  Installation was easy, though the hose isn't too long.  The included fan is a nice 4 pin one, though there are better ones out there (you can replace it, but if that's your thinking, you may want to get the Corsair or another AIO water cooler).  My temps lowered and the system remained quiet, though it was quiet and cool to begin with.This is a good setup, but it's not the best.  When you combine the price, the simplicity of installation, and results, it's a 5 star solution however.  Recommended to newcomers to water cooling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CNV6EJE47X8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CYX45CK#wasThisHelpful","R2CNV6EJE47X8O","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved my Gigabyte Windforce 980, but I not only wanted to gain the sizable bump from the 980 to 980 Ti, but also to move away from air cooling to a simple AIO water cooled setup.  FWIW, most uses will be happy with a reference 980 Ti, but I like the cooling setup here.As I've moved to smaller and smaller cases (I've owned towers bigger than my Saint Bernard), it's getting harder to keep the contents cool, especially when those are at the extreme end of things.  I used a all in one cooler (Corsair 105) on my i7 4790k to great effect, but my video card would make a bit more noise (the 980 and 980 Ti generally are very power efficient and have limited thermal demands by high end video card standards), so I wanted to nip that in the bud.The 980 Ti is amazing.  It swallows up 1080p at any setting and 1440p isn't too much trouble.  4k is certainly possible, but some games will need some reduced settings (mind you at 4k just about anything looks amazing), and there's always SLI!  Just about any 980 Ti card will give you this.  Some will have a higher base of boosted clock, but the differences are minor.  If the above is all you want, get the cheapest 980 Ti from a reputable seller.  As noted earlier, I had a small case and wanted to run cool and quiet.  I've noticed that you can be fast, cool, quiet, or affordable--hell you can even pick two or even three.  You can't do all four!  This comes close (by 980 Ti and water cooling standards).  You do trade off some of the ultimate performance, as the memory and VRMs are air cooled, but the air cooling is great, and all of the heat from the GPU die is taken away.  The included fan is ok, and rarely adds much noise.  The GPU die is much cooler, and while I haven't done much overclocking (it already comes with a higher clock than most 980 Tis), I've seen some push past 1.5ghz (vs 1ghz base clock for reference 980 Ti, but all seem clocked a bit faster from the factory).  Anyway if you're looking to get some added speed for your investment, it's there.The market for AIO liquid (or in this case liquid + air though EVGA does sell a liquid only solution for a custom loop) cooled video cards is limited, especially for Nvida.  There are a ton of BYO solutions, but I didn't want to do that.  As a result there is a price premium, though now that's dropped to a small premium.  At $699 this is a great deal.  At $799 or so, maybe not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUM8M6X9EH2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0UX8TA#wasThisHelpful","RUM8M6X9EH2Q","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steam in home streaming is a killer feature many people don't know about.  I love being able to use my gaming system anywhere in my home, and there's rarely any issues with lag or image quality.  Traditionally you needed a system (could be Windows, Linux, or Mac) running steam to be the client (plus a Windows PC host with appropriate hardware for your games).  The client system could be old, slow, or both, as long as it had a strong network connection and ability to decode HD video streams.  This turned my ultrabook into a gaming setup on the couch while my wife and I watch a movie or TV.Anyway, this takes that idea and turns the software feature into a standalone hardware product.  It's not a bad idea, and it works great (I only tested via gigabit ethernet).  It does everything I expect from the software Steam in home streaming, and it doesn't require a PC.  It saves a little power too.  I'm kinda regretting getting this, as that's all it does.  I kinda wish I could do steam in home streaming on an Apple TV, Roku, or Kindle Fire TV (think you can sideload the hacked Nvidia clone, but I've had bad luck with that on Android), as there's really no other use for this.  It it could run Kodi or something, I'd understand.  For now, it's a $50 one trick pony.  Note there's no controller, so it turns to closer to $100, though you can use that elsewhere too.It's not bad, not do I recommend avoiding this.

"This is a tough product to review, but suffice to say it's not a game pad in the traditional sense.  If that's what you want, use a Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller and the appropriate adapter for your PC.  They will give you that experience.So what do you get with the Steam Controller?  It can be a game pad, albeit with a bit of a learning curve, and if that's your only controller, you'll adapt soon enough.  Maybe 1-2 hours of gameplay, but even after that, you'll probably want to work on custom configurations.  It's not something you have to do, but to it'll help you get the most out of the Steam Controller.  Fortunately Steam makes the customizations (or borrowing someone else's layout presets) simple.  The real benefit comes from games that don't work well with traditional game pads, as the touchpad surfaces can make traditional KB mouse games playable, though there are some compromises.The build quality is solid, and everything you need is included (including batteries).  There's a dongle, but there's hardly any latency.  As I'll still be keeping my 360 controllers, I'll just have to have a dongle for keyboard/mouse, another for the 360 controllers, and this.

"In an era where how headphones look seems to matter more than how they sound, it's great to restore the focus on audio fidelity.  After a brief break in period (honestly I couldn't wait to try these), I plugged these into my Geek Out v2 headphone amp and tried some of my favorite FLAC tracks.  I was immediately enthralled with the rich sound stage and the complete balance in the presentation.  The rich flat sound stage (better than any closed back headphones I've used) allows you to adjust things as you see fit with an equalizer, though out of the box these will lack the pop of a Beats or similarly bass boosted headphone. That's not to say these cannot produce bass or will leave you wanting.  Just tell them what to do (via input) and expect the best (and still get blown away).  On the flip side the treble is crisper than I can articulate.  I'm a bit hard of hearing from childhood ear infections, and I struggle with muddled sounds.  With these, I can hear details I cannot recall ever hearing.  Simply put, you'll have to pay 3-5x the price for anything better sound wise.The only real con is that comparable (in audio performance) headphones are generally built better than these, but as noted they cost a lot more.  You can also find headphones for this price with a better build, but they offer the sound of $25-30 headphones.  Anyway, it's I think Audio-Technica designed these with the best parts where it matters most, and these won't break anytime soon.  The detachable cable is a nice plus that will also add years of life to these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WR6ZVSAHA5CM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEU9CFA#wasThisHelpful","R2WR6ZVSAHA5CM","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I do recommend securing the top as well to avoid and topples from aggressive play, and as such, it may not be best for all rooms (it does fit a range of heights).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ZJDFCS66NZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY250EM#wasThisHelpful","R11ZJDFCS66NZB","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Generally I tend to use a wired connection whenever possible with desktops, but sometimes that's not possible.  My motherboard has wireless N built in, so I decided to upgrade to AC.Installation was simple, and the included half height back plate is a blessing for some older compact cases.  Another perk is the external antenna.  It's great!  It not only is detached from the card so I can place it anywhere (within a meter), it also has a robust (magnetic) base and it's own antennae.  I've used a few of these, and this is among the best antenna setups.  I downloaded the latest driver (6/23/15), and it installed nicely.  Since I have a wireless AC router, I was able to access at top speeds on 5ghz as well as Wireless N on 2.4ghz (this is the best one can ask for).  I didn't do any formal speed tests, but it was plenty fast for 1080p mkv files.I couldn't ask for more in a wireless card.  Some things to consider: if you have a free PCI Express slot, you can use this or a USB solution.  Do note that many USB solutions struggle with the power provided by a USB port (especially one on the front of the case) and need a powered USB hub for maximum performance (the internal amplifiers need more power).  Also, there's a huge difference on performance with the antenna placed where you want it (up top out from behind the PC or desk) vs stuck behind your PC.  This will get you the performance you want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S0D4M7OGINWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VEH6NFY#wasThisHelpful","R1S0D4M7OGINWR","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like this bag because it's a sling that fits a SLR with a vertical grip (I've used a D7100 and D750 in said configuration) and a pro midrange zoom mounted on it.  I can squeeze my Fuji X-E2 (with 56mm f/1.2) and Fuji X100s.  That's damn impressive.  I could swap either for a flash.  Its relatively comfy, and well built enough.There's a lot to like, but there's a couple things driving me crazy.  The dividers are poor.  Slick, semi rigid (more rigid that I like), minimal padding, and minimal configuration.  The outside and overall design is well though out, but my camera barely fits, not because the lens is too long (well that's the case with my 70-200/2.8), rather because of the padding.  You can't adjust any for depth.  The mini dividers only attach at one point near the opening.  Speaking of the opening, another issue I have is the upper compartment.  It's great, but the opening is a bit difficult.  Granted putting a mirrorless camera/lens up there is a bonus (you can do the same with Case Logic's smaller slings too!), but the opening lags behind the compartment.  Fix the lining of the lower compartment and this definitely is a 5 star case, and with the price around $40, it's the best out there in that range (by a large margin).Otherwise, as noted the overall design is nice, and the buckles and adjustments are well thought out.  It fits/feels ok on my back (I'm 6'7"" and hefty so nothing really is designed for me), and there are handles.  The quality of materials isn't so much lacking, rather it's unremarkable.  Some brands have a much more premium feel.  For the price, I'm ok, but I'd love an upgraded interior.If you've got a battery grip on your camera, there's very little to choose from in the size range, and nothing for $40-45.

"To be honest, I wouldn't have ordered this if it weren't a complementary Vine item, but I'm glad I did.  I never even heard of such a ball, let along did I think it would work--it works!A friend of mine is a basketball coach, so I dropped by with this ball.  After getting curious looks of disbelief and questions as to if I missed the deadline on April fools, we started trying it out.  The players really responded to it.  It felt like a normal ball (a good one at that), but they could immediately track their stats.  That's the real genius here.  Most of us can seen when the ball goes in the net or not, but keeping track of shots made/missed in practice can be tedious.  Plus you can hook some speakers (preferably bluetooth) up and have this make solo practice a game and keep tabs.  It really works!Wow, this sounds amazing!  It sure does, but there are some limitations.  For now iPhone (or iOS) only (works on iOS 9 btw).  Android is coming.  It also isn't for tracking layups or dunks, rather it's designed for 7+ foot shots.  It's also not perfect.  I was hoping for 95%+ accuracy, but 85-90% accuracy (requires a net to work at all btw).  That's still amazing, but there's room for improvement.  Also it's more useful in solo practice, as there are plenty of other ways to make group practice interesting.  That's not to say it's not useful there, but $200 can probably be better used in that context.As a solo practice tool, this is awesome.  Like a fitbit or other modern doodad, this aids in accountability and adds a game like aspect to a mundane activity.  Sure great players have always driven themselves to taking thousands of shots a day, but not everyone has that focus.  This can definitely help, and while the accuracy is still a work in progress, over thousands of shots, it will show trends (and hopefully improvement).  Plus it talks to social media, so if by chance you and a buddy have one, you can share stats and trash talk on Facebook.  Isn't life grand!  On a more serious note, it can show coach, dad (or mom), that you're using it and getting your reps in, to help justify that expensive summer basketball camp.So is this a gadget for early adapters and hard core basketball players?  Mostly.  We all have different budgets, and for some $200 isn't much, but for many it is, and yeah, it's a niche.  It'll do more to help your game than a pair of fancy shoes or expensive athletic wear, and for the gym rats who put in hours a day working on shooting, this is a great (and novel) addition to the arsenal.

"I've owned several Panasonic shavers (Arc 3, Arc 4, older designs ...) over the years because I tend to like them, usually quite a bit.  With that in mine I had high hopes.To cut to the chase, this was a bit of a letdown.  It's still a rather good shaver, just not the best Panasonic by a good measure.The design is similar to what I've seen the past few years, and that's perfectly fine.  The weight was oddly light, and while a lighter weight shave can lead to less fatigue, here it just feels cheap.  The quality of the plastics don't help, and in the end the lighter weight made it harder to control.  Worst of all, the high degree of vibration present would be mitigated with added heft, and in it's absence it's a bit hard to use for longer periods of time.  I'm unsure how someone new to Panasonic would view the weight, as I'm largely biased towards a certain feel this lacks.The shave itself is good, though not great.  It can take a little time to break in, though I'm past that point and I'd say this is a slight step behind my previous shavers, though the lack of heft may mean I'm not quite using it right.  It's still a rather good shaver, but if you're already using a great one, you may be taking a step back.  One area where this continues Panasonic's prowess is the ability to use this wet or dry.  It may be unusual for you to use an electric in the shower or with soap, but it's a great experience (and entirely optional).  I've generally had better results wet, and this is no different.Charging is relatively quick, though the cleaning base is rather bulky and somewhat ungainly (fortunately it's optional).  Panasonic never quite got these right, and I think they're more of a way to get a revenue stream from consumables than altogether necessary.  Once charged you get an hour or so (many variables) of use, but you can't really tell how long.  The best of the best give you a precise measure, and here's you're guessing a bit with the limited LEDs.  The battery is a lithium one, which explains the lightweight and should provide years of carefree performance.I didn't really do much with the trimmer (I have a rather nice dedicated trimmer), though it seemed a bit flimsy (for what it's worth, I've had mediocre results from similar trimmers on Panasonic shavers).Overall this is a 4 star shaver, mostly because of what this (and all Panasonic shavers) gets right, especially the wet dry shave.  The price is good if you're looking for a cleaner (typically models in this price range lack that).  There are better Panasonics out there (look for deals on older Arc 4 models), but this is still better than most.  If you've used Panasonic before and prefer Norelco or Braun, this won't change your mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R146M4AJ8F3WTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","R146M4AJ8F3WTG","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As digital has largely replaced film and applications like Photoshop and Lightroom have replaced literal photoshops and lightrooms the concept of a filter went from a piece of glass (or plastic) in front of a lens to a software function with sliders and other configuration options.  Sure you can still buy various colored filters, but for the most part, you can replace many filters in software.  Polarizing filters are one of a couple or so that you simply cannot replicate effectively after the shot.Much like polarized sunglasses or coatings on screens, windows, etc... polarizing filters reduce light transmission (not the intent of a polaring filter, but it's the most obvious effect) and more importantly reduce glare.  Simply put some light (that's polarized a certain way) passes through while the rest does not.  This means that water, glass, and other reflective surfaces no longer create distracting glare, and sometimes you can see through what you otherwise couldn't (which is why driving sunglasses are often polarized, especially with today's rather angled windshields). You can't really remove glare in post production, so a polarizing is essential for these situations.  There's even more benefit however, as these filters can do wonders with the sky.  Similar concept to what it does with water or glass, but the deep blues created by the effect are magical.  Do note that wide angle lenses can capture light from such an array of directions that some see this effect more than others, so YMMV with polarized skies on wide angle lenses.Onto this polarizer.  Simply put, it's about as good as it gets.  There are a couple niche vendors (Singh-Ray) that arguably offer comparable glass, but B+W makes some of the most solidly built filters (a bit more important with one that needs rotating like these) with a bronze body, slim (almost unbelievably so when you consider these take a cap) frames, and top notch German glass and filter coatings.  The ones used in this particular coating minimize the darkening (to allow for more control over ISO/shutter/aperture) and don't add a color cast.  Speaking of coatings, they minimize internal glare and make these easy to clean/keep clean.The biggest challenge is price and the fact that these are probably not going to be used all the time.  On a trip (I'm no pro, just an amateur who takes way too many photos), I may use it a couple times (more if I'm outdoors with beautiful clear skies).  It turns good shots into amazing ones, but given the cost of this, users on a budget may want to spend elsewhere first.  I do recommend getting a great polarizer, such as this, rather than skimping now and paying again later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23FRZU4R2AK4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OK6YSAS#wasThisHelpful","R23FRZU4R2AK4R","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally ordered this as a gag gift--something for some holiday gift exchange, but my wife mentioned all the DIY recipes on Pinterest, so it piqued my curiosity.  I suppose the DIY recipes make sense, since this is all natural.  I didn't bother with them, but I did find this oddly effective.  It's a bit of extra work, and frankly I'm not that concerned with how my poo smells.  A few (three seems to work, but YMMV) sprays leave a lasting scent that seems like a nice bath, maybe eucalyptus.  No wonder koala's don't smell that bad!

"I tend to let my beard grow because I'm a bit too lazy to shave.  I have a ton of great shaving gear (silvertip brush, various soaps, German razor, etc...), but it's not so easy to do when I'm tired and grouchy.  If I let my beard get all loko, then the wife gets a bit grouchy (as she should).  I had other trimmers, and honestly they get the job done, but this--this is sweet.First off it has power.  Both to easily chew through some pretty thatchy beard and to do so a few times without recharging (I've had others that seem dead after 1 1/2 trims (albeit heavy trims due to the neglect mentioned above).  This makes short work of trimming and is a joy to use.  It's quick, and with the gazillion settings, can do whatever I need and then some.  The balance makes it easy to pull of the ""and then some"" with flair and panache, and that along with the ergonomic grip keeps you from getting tired.This isn't the best at fine details, though it's not so bad either.  The combs do a great job of handling different levels of fullness, and honestly if you can't get your beard the way you want it, keep trying, as this tool can do it.  Cleanup is a breeze (though most beard trimmers a simple compared to a traditional electric razor).Kudos to working corded as well.

"I'm generally not a fan of Otterboxes.  They do their thing, and supposedly they do it well.  It just makes every phone look like it's wrapped in a block of foam from an old pair of cheap flip flops.  I don't tend to revere the thinness or industrial design of phones as much as tech reviewers seem to (had no problem with plastic Samsung phones or thick phones with big batteries), but the Otterbox look wasn't for me.  I tried the Defender on the Note 5, and between the case being a little trimmer than others and the size of the phone, the scale wasn't that bad.  It just suffered from the other thing I hate with Otterboxes--the crappy screen protector that makes everything look bad and gets weird air gaps.  With some work you can remove it from the otherwise nice Defender ...Or you can buy this!  Yeah it also has a crap screen protector, but you can bypass that easily and use a ballistic glass one (my recommendation) or just pass on the protector.  The overall effect is a grippy and not too big (it's a Note 5, so it's still big) result.  It's easier to hold than the bare phone, and it seems to offer loads of protection.  I've yet to drop my phone, and I don't really do much that a bare phone couldn't, but the protection (or at least notion of protection) and grip is well worth it.

Assembly was pretty straight forward (I've assembled 100+ similar things over my life, so YMMV).  Given the weight, you'll probably want to get it in the right room (with help) before assembling.  The finished product doesn't have too much of a weird smell (it's supposedly non-toxic).Given the build, it could last forever, or just a couple moves (if not careful--though this heavy unit will probably break a few other things and or backs in the process).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39XFS1VVXOP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S8ZOJU#wasThisHelpful","R39XFS1VVXOP5","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I preordered my Note 5 as soon as it was announced, and got bought the first decent case that I saw--Spigen Neo Hybrid.  It's not the gold standard of cases, but it's what I started out with.  As noted, I bought it based on availability rather than any thorough comparison, so when I had the chance to try some other Note 5 cases (thanks Vine!), I did.This Verus case is nice, but I'll be putting the Spigen back on.  If I didn't have the Spigen, I'd be happy with this.  Looks are always subjective, though the Verus looks better in person.  Not amazing or anything, but the textures are nice.  The back has a nice texture, which is grippier than the phone itself (not saying much) and my Spigen case (not among its strengths), and the side has a somewhat grippy, vaguely metal looking trim piece (this is a 2 piece case).  If it were girppier or more ""premium"" this might be a 5 star case, but it's only kinda grippy (though grippy isn't always a positive when it means gripping dirt, lint, and pocket linings), and the buttons feel cheap.  The Spigen has metal buttons, and honestly, I never appreciated that so much until I went back to cases like this (the Verus).Those nits aside, the Verus fits well, all the ports are where they should be, offers screen protection (when laid screen down), seems to offer decent (though not Otterbox) protection (haven't dropped), and it retains the general feel of slimness (for a 5.7"" phone).  I wish this had a metal trim piece (I get that plastic with a metal look is better for radio signals) with metal buttons.  Otherwise, to be honest, this is another case.  It's not a bad one, and I wouldn't be itching to buy a new one, but since I already have one, I'm putting that on.5 stars for getting the basics right but lacking some premium feel.  Check out the Spigen Neo Hybrid for the same price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36C8WI8LT8URY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQKYSF6#wasThisHelpful","R36C8WI8LT8URY","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The lessons discussed in this book as well as the overall focus can both reinforce what some already know and inspire grander visions for one and all.  It's more than ""go big or go home"", but I suppose you could sum it up that way.  We all have different outlooks and personalities, and for some, much of what's laid out here doesn't come natural, and I think this book tends to help best with those personalities.More than anything, it helps transition from thinking like an employee or individual contributor to an entrepreneur or owner.  It also offers a realistic assessment of your chances if you don't make the most of every opportunity, even if it means stepping outside your comfort zone.  Where this book falls short is in details or examples one can apply.  It's more of a focus on attitude than execution, though there are other books that better address the how.This book isn't for everyone, and it's not perfect, but I found it to be a good read and passed it on.  4 ... almost 5 stars (could be better written, more actionable, and less about the author--I get these books are based on experience, but I put the book down a few times because he was unctuous).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N5I6CUASL9SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599185741#wasThisHelpful","R1N5I6CUASL9SJ","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my 65"" plasma, which I found out lacks a USB port (using the TV's USB port is great because it turns these off when TV is off), so I used these on the 47"" LG LCD.  The length is perfect for the 47"" TV, and the lighting effect is wonderful.  It's a coolish light (6500k sound right), but  it's effect will be influenced based on wall color.  Like any LED, they light immediately at full brightness, and the power draw is minimal.  Application was easy, as the strip has wonderful adhesive.  Be sure to clean the back of your TV first and allow to dry.

I did get 25-40% bump in speed, and if I were buying one, I'd get this (the pass through is a huge plus too), but the upgrade experience was a bit lackluster.

"**Update 10/1/15**The lack of a web interface (really Google?) or ability to see what's connected via the app is really annoying.  You can get some info when trying to set up a ""static IP"" (more of a reserved DHCP address, but a nice though not unique feature), but even then a lot of things are listed as ""unknown device"" (despite having NETBIOS names).  Most folks may not even notice, but for advanced users that omission, plus the inability to change DHCP settings (IP range, router IP, etc...) has made things rather difficult.  For a new network of more modest usage, it would be fine, but I have a lot of things set up for a 192.168.1.xx network, and this refuses to play that way.  Again most things will simply get whatever address the router provides and move on, but with a home domain and a ton of NAS units, I really started wishing I never saw this router.What you can do with the app (only way to configure):* Basic setup* Change SSID/wireless password (one total SSID for 2.4ghz/5ghz)* Measure network performance* Prioritize network performance by system* Configure DNS: use Google's servers (default), use what your ISP provides, or custom (only primary and secondary) DNS servers* Enable/disable DHCP (default enable)* Reserve IP address (referred to as Static IP in app)* Port forwarding* uPNPWhat you cannot do (as of 10/1)* View/change wireless channels* Enable/disable 2.4ghz or 5ghz radios* Force AC on 5ghz or N on 2.4ghz* Set router LAN IP (defaults to 192.168.86.1) note WAN IP is defined by modem* Set subnet* Set DHCP range (defaults to 192.168.86.2 +) or other DHCP options like lease time etc...* View connected devices (NETBIOS name, IP address, MAC etc...)* Name connected devices (for management)* No port based QOS (only one port)* No granular firewall (block MAC addresses, ports, IPs, URLs, etc...)* No MAC filterHonestly the 2Wire home gateway provided by Uverse had more options.  I get that the whole idea is to keep much of this behind the scenes, but if there's going to be ""Extended Settings"", they should be comprehensive.**Original review**I'd consider the grade to be ""incomplete"", but here's what we have for now:I've owned and reviewed ten or so routers over the years (both bought with my funds and via Amazon Vine), though I don't exactly consider myself an expert, more of someone who knows what they like and how to achieve it with traditional routers.  In many ways I think I'm not exactly the intended audience for this, but I suppose in others I am.  Anyway, it's been a journey with this little guy!While it's made by TP-LINK, I see it's ancestors as the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1) and Google Glasses moreso than TP-LINK's earlier routers.  It's more refined than the Dream, complete with a slick design, nice packaging, and mostly complete UX.  It's a bit like Google Glasses, as I see this as being ahead of it's time, but unlike Google Glasses, I think the time will come for this router.  I'm just not sure it's today.  Looks aside, it's caught being too similar to a traditional router with some transformative features but not a huge leap forward, and certainly not enough for the price.  Software updates and price reductions may change this assessment, but at $200-400 (think some supply-demand price spikes going on), it's just not worth it in Sept 2015.The gazillion antennae just work.  That's a huge plus.  There's not much to setup (we'll get to that in a minute), and I've had very stable connections.  I have not however seen any appreciable increase in range (compared to Netgear r6300v2 running DD-WRT) and I've seen a marked decrease in 5ghz bandwidth.  Of course my gigabit network performance has dropped, as I can't plug anything in!  Really Google?  I get that wireless like Tang, flying cars, and nuclear power is the future, but when has a wired connection failed anyone? So now I need to put an eight port switch in the living room to branch to the unmanaged 24 port switch in the basement and another one upstairs.  Switches are cheap, and in theory bandwidth is unaffected.  Latency and timing is another matter, and Nvidia recommends a direct connection to router for GameStream (oh well--thanks Google), though Steam in home streaming is working great.  I really consider 4 ports to be stingy and 1 is almost spiteful.As for the setup ... it's unique.  I think it can be said to be better, but I'd rather use a browser.  For novices the app driven approach removes a lot of the confusion and intimidation at the expense of making what I want to do (generally rather advanced) harder to find.  I also worry what happens when there's no longer an app available.  Google has a slowly increasing graveyard of unsupported products.  Without a web gui, if I need an available app for whatever my device is 2-3 years from now to update this, will it be there?  Will it work on my old phone, will it work on my new one?  These questions aside, I think 95% of people will find this setup experience to be both refreshing and beneficial.The rest is TBD.  I don't own any Nest (or similar) devices.  For now it's a stylish cylinder that does a decent job as a router, but a year from now will it be the center of my connected home, or will it be an expensive and firm foam roller?  Speaking of expensive--it's really a $80-100 device inside.  The software side doesn't feel like it adds $100+  If it was an Amazon Echo or somehow did something appreciable besides be a router, I'd get it.  I just don't see that, and I see plenty of better performing TP-LINK devices for less than half the cost.  I think Google is short sighted in their pricing and had a chance to really get a foothold in connected homes, but it will be much tougher at $200+ (especially when bundled with a lower tier brand).A generous 3 stars based on appreciating the fresh approach and potential, but losing one for being stingy with ethernet ports and another for price.  Who knows, maybe it will be transformed in a firmware update, but for now, it's just not worth the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NAKS386TLKZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ALA9LA#wasThisHelpful","R1NAKS386TLKZY","A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As with many books on entrepreneurs/leadership/business, many of the items presented here can be seen as novel the first time you read it and thus the value you receive from this book will vary based on what you may have already read.  With that it mind, I reserve the best rating for books that expand upon the existing pool of wisdom and present the information in a new or at least more effective way.  This book scores a little in both areas, especially the author's sincere humble story like writing.As a book largely targeted towards millennials (anyone can benefit from this book) and with a skew towards modern tech driven startups (though again it can benefit anyone), the focus on being genuine, entertaining, and innovative is a success.  The writing style makes this more of a story than text or reference book, and the author's first hand experiences, combined with the author's humility and insights elevate this book above the rest.You can be successful without reading this, and many successful entrepreneurs didn't follow the path the author lays out, but it's hard to imagine a better approach to succeeding today.

"always liked the critters, but the cases seemed so bulky.  Whenever I used a tiny old iPhone with one of these it really seemed rediculous, but I decided to give this a try.The size of the Note makes the added Otterbox girth less rediculous, and if you've only owned older notes, the combined thinness of the Note 5 and added bulk of the Otterbox still leaves you with a manageable phone.  The added grippiness of the Otterbox is way ahead of the base phone or my Spigen Neo Hybrid.  The grippieness and innate Otterbox protection make this a good fit for the working phone reputation of the Notes.  The difficulty in getting the S Pen in/out and the lackluster screen protector don't.  Cases with integrated screen protectors just don't do it for me.  The airgap and lack of quality vs (the amazing screen) just annoy me.  It's the usual Otterbox screen protector (glare, reduced sensitivity, etc...), so if you've used an Otterbox before and didn't mind the screen protector, you'll be happy.  I'll probably remove the screen protector (there's a helpful YouTube video from ""HD Geek Review"" which shows you how).

"Back in the day a 2.1 amp charge was a fast charger, then Qualcomm and their partners introduced various quick charge solutions, and now they're on their 2nd gen version (3rd gen just announced as a technology), and this works with my Note 3 (first gen) and my wife's Droid Turbo and my Note 5 (both 2nd gen).  The speeds are what we're used to and the phones reports Quick Charging as being active.  Only one of the two ports is a QC port, but the other is 2.1a.  If we somehow needed to charge both quickly, once you get to 80% charge the other port is pretty much just as fast, so charge until 80% and switch as needed, but with one phone, you might as well always use the QC port.The size is compact but not micro.  The included cable fits just about any case, and of course you can use any cable you want to.  Heck, this can charge an iPhone or any other USB based device (just as a 2.1a charger).

"An AeroPress isn't for everyone.  But if you like great coffee and espresso and don't mind (or even appreciate) a hands on (quite literally) approach, this is the way to go.  It's the go to way to make espresso on the go or without a big fancy machine, and hell, even if you have one, it's not a bad approach.  There are a ton of AeroPress SKUs here on Amazon (various bundles and kits), though they all seem to be the same AeroPress (no knockoffs), so you really can't go wrong with any of them.I use coffee ground at home in a burr grinder to espresso level fineness, but to be honest, this will work with various grinds, including store bought drip coffee (different, thought not bad, results).  Store bought espresso grinds would also work (either pre ground bags/cans or using whole beans and a store grinder).  The cleanup is easy, especially with fine grinds, as it comes out more or less as a puck.

"I bought this mower at Home Depot because after reading the reviews I was worried it would be too much work and I'd need to return it. I am a small female, and I am not strong. My yard is about 1/3 acre with a pretty significant 45 degree hill in the back. I have used the mower to do the entire lawn twice now and I am very impressed. I didn't bother with the bag and just let the clippings go onto the lawn as mulch. The first time was a lot of work because the grass was longer, but the second time it was much easier. Each go was about 1.5-1.75 hours. I put the mower on the third shortest setting (there are about 10 or 12 length settings). I won't lie, the hill is kind of a pain to do with this mower, and yes, sticks get stuck in the mower and I have to occasionally stop and pull them out. But, this is not a reason to give up on using a reel mower. There is no gas to use, there are no fumes. It's a little loud (I feel a little silly for thinking it would be almost silent), but it's definitely quieter than a gas-powered mower.

"I am not a makeup person, I need products that are extremely easy to apply and are difficult to screw up. This eyeliner fits the bill for me - it allows you to put on a very thin, even line that looks great even without eye shadow. It goes on shiny but then dries matte, and it creates a very sharp edge that really cannot be smudged out, so only buy this if you like that look. Sometimes in the inside corner of my eyes it will crack and the line will have gaps that I need to go fill in again.

"This is a great product if you want a moisturizer to use in the morning underneath other makeup. I love that it has SPF and it is unscented. I wish that it came in one of the pump bottles so I didn't have to put my fingers into the container each time to use it. Sometimes instead I get a little bit out with a q-tip. It also works very well for removing makeup - a tiny bit on a q-tip underneath my eyes makes removing smudged eyeliner / shadow / mascara a breeze. The reason for four starts instead of five is that I have skin that can be somehow oily and dry at the same time, and sometimes this moisturizer feels a little too greasy / heavy to me.

"I received this book as a gift as my husband and I are just beginning the home buying process. Overall this was a great book for a first-time buyer who has very little background on how to go about what is probably the biggest purchase of your life. I marked several areas in the book that I thought were important, such as how to find a motivated seller, avoiding loans with pre-payment penalties, examples of lender fees you might not be aware of, traits of good lenders, pros and cons of new vs old homes, and the best way to tour a house.I was irked by some of the occasional nonchalantly sarcastic language, especially the part where the authors described graduate degrees as pointless and silly (although maybe this was a bit of self deprecation since one of the authors has an MBA). I also didn't like suggestion in Chapter 10 that you should go for an adjustable rate mortgage if you can't afford the higher monthly payment on a fixed rate mortgage but you still want to buy a more expensive house (to be fair in the actual mortgage section chapter 7 they cautioned against this).One important point in this book that is missing is a description of the opportunity cost of money. This was absent from the loan section where the amount of interest paid between 15 and 30 year loans was compared. This seems like an important topic that home buyers should know about before choosing a mortgage. Just because you paid less interest doesn't mean you saved money.With this review I was also hoping to dispel the very pervasive myth that deducting mortgage interest saves considerable money on your taxes. For the vast majority of home owners this will not be the case, and I was disappointed by the way this was never mentioned in the book. To deduct mortgage interest, property taxes, etc, you have to itemize your deductions. This means that you give up the standard deduction, which is currently $12,600 for a couple filing jointly. Your only savings comes from itemized deductions over this amount. On a $350,000 home with 20% down payment, you are looking at around $15,000 in interest + property taxes if you started paying January 1st. Without any other deductions this saves you about $700 on your taxes if you are in one of the highest brackets. This amount goes down every single year as you pay less interest. Not the huge savings that your realtor and lender might suggest to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NO591TGEV9DY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118117964#wasThisHelpful","R1NO591TGEV9DY","AN15B6AK28MMS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN15B6AK28MMS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glasslock containers are my number one ""go to"" for food storage, especially for containers for taking to work that I am planning to microwave. I've had two of the round ones for about three years that my husband and I have used almost daily. They survived many many trips banging around in my work bag. The lids on my two original ones are starting to give out (sometimes hard to close, and the plastic at the creases seems to be weakening, although they are still usable), so I decided to get this new set.In the first box I received, the lid on the largest rectangular container was cracked. I let Amazon customer service know about this and they immediately shipped a new set. I checked over all the new ones very carefully and there were no issues. My only complaint is that it can be hard to open the lids, and sometimes the little rubber seal comes out because of this. I had never had this issue before with the old ones.I didn't experience the chipping issue that others have mentioned with my old set of containers, and these seem to be identical in form although the markings are a little different.

"I recently upgraded to this toothbrush from the Oral-B Vitality. The battery on my old one lasted about seven years before it wouldn't fully charge up anymore, so I have high hopes for this one. The first time I used it, it repeatedly complained (the red light flashed) because I was brushing too hard. It lights up your entire mouth so it is hard to miss no matter which way you are holding the brush. Since then I've learned where I am pushing too hard and can adjust the pressure so I don't get the light flashing as much.In general my teeth feel significantly cleaner with this new brush, especially in the back where it is hard to clean all the way, and also the inside of my front bottom teeth where it's hard to sweep back and forth. I think the majority of this is due to the more powerful motor (and fresh battery) on this brush since the head is basically the same.My favorite feature is the 30 second timer that tells you when you move to the next quadrant of your mouth. My old Vitality had a two minute timer, which I often didn't make it all the way through, but with the 30 second timer it basically guilts you into doing the recommended amount of time.I also appreciate the little house for the toothbrush heads that you snap the charger into. After each use you can remove the head and put it away to keep it clean. I hope this prevents the yucky toothpaste buildup on the handle (if you've used these electric brushes you know what I mean...) It also allows multiple people to use the same toothbrush base since the house holds 4 different brush heads. If you are using this brush by yourself, I could see this feature being less great for you since it takes up a lot more counter space than the older models that don't have it.My only complaint about this toothbrush is that there is only one on/off button which cycles through the different modes. To turn it off you have to hit the button three times (if you are using the first mode). This is pretty minor, not worth taking off a star.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322WYXEYZ0FXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UKKHB4#wasThisHelpful","R322WYXEYZ0FXL","AN15B6AK28MMS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN15B6AK28MMS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is by far my favorite nighttime lotion that I have ever used, and the low price makes it even more awesome. It is light, unscented, easy to apply, makes my skin feel great, and lasts a very long time. However, I just couldn't give it five stars because even though I love the way it makes my skin feel, I haven't seen any reduction in the redness on my face after several months of using it. I bought both the night and the day ""redness relief"" cream because I have rosacea which makes my cheeks and nose very red, especially in the winter. I will keep using it unless I find a product that actually dose reduce redness for me, since I love pretty much everything else about it. Based on the reviews here it looks like this does work for some people, so I would highly recommend giving it a shot. Even if it doesn't reduce redness for you it is still a great moisturizer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDCCITYZIJFTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013L3XMM#wasThisHelpful","RDCCITYZIJFTW","AN15B6AK28MMS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN15B6AK28MMS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have a math and science background (although I haven't spent much time on stats) and now work in the medical field.

"This review is for the WeMo Insight switch. I love this little device. It was very easy to set up - all you need to do is plug it into the wall, download the app to your phone, and go through the simple instructions to get the firmware installed. It takes about five minutes. For me the most interesting part is the information on energy usage in the app. I normally have it plugged into a lamp in my living room. The app tells me that on average the lamp has been on 25 mins a day, it's an average of 16W when it is on, and is costing me about 2 cents per month in electricity. I can turn the light on and off from anywhere as long as the WiFi in my house is on. Sometimes I flip it on and off when I know my husband is home just to say hi.A nice feature is being able to set it to ""away mode"", which allows you to set up rules for turning on and off while you are gone. You can also set regular rules for this as well, and even have it turn on and off with the sunset / sunrise.The plug itself is pretty large, although it still allows me to access the port below it as long as the plug is regular sized. You could not put two of these into the same outlet.It's a little strange that the reviews here are for four different Belkin products, although they are similar. It would be great to be able to separate them out because after using this one I'd like to know on average what customers have thought of the other options.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20UKFJX9428D6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOEDJ9W#wasThisHelpful","R20UKFJX9428D6","AN15B6AK28MMS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN15B6AK28MMS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is divided into three parts: addressing company operations and organization, team-building and leadership, and career management. I thought the advice about dealing with crises was particularly useful and something I hadn't read too much about before. The real life examples were also useful. However, some of it felt kind of embarrassingly cheesy (Area of Destiny?). I agreed with most of the book but it seemed mostly common sense and I didn't see a lot of new ideas.

"This is a really pretty color and very long lasting, however, it can be difficult to apply without getting it all over your face. The brush screws onto the base with a spring mechanism so it's not possible to control how much powder gets on the brush. The brush is also quite large so it can be difficult to get in the corners of your eyelid. I use a primer to help keep it in place but I still can end up with smears of sparkle below my eyes. What I usually do is put a layer of moisturizer below my eyes before putting on this shadow. The moisturizer catches anything that falls and you can just wipe it off when you are done. Note, the shadow looks lavender in the container but it goes on silver.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AQR57FCD0JLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Y4HU7Y#wasThisHelpful","R1AQR57FCD0JLO","AN15B6AK28MMS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN15B6AK28MMS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This makeup doesn't work that well for me but I still gave it four stars because I think it is mainly my skin type. I have drier skin which can look very flaky when I apply this. If I really go to town on moisturizer, then this powder makes my skin look fantastic by absorbing any extra oil and providing a smooth, even finish. However, I'm not a huge fan of putting on that much moisturizer.

"I have been using this foundation almost every day for several months. It's one of my favorite foundations.Pros:  Easy to apply and blend  Bottle is well designed so you can get small or large amounts out  Easy to choose your level of coverage, and still looks natural if you put more in certain areas and less (or none) in other areas  Nice finish that isn't too shiny but also not dry (as long as you pick the right moisturizer - see below)  One bottle lasts forever - I've barely made a dent in two months!Cons:  It's a little bit expensive for foundation, but as I mentioned above it lasts a while  If your skin is dry, it can exacerbate the problem.

The bottle doesn't last as long as you think it might since a lot of what is in there is just compressed gas.

"I like the fact that this sunscreen has a high SPF and still doesn't feel greasy going on. It is easy to apply and doesn't leave me feeling uncomfortable like some sunscreens do because of the stickiness. However, an odd problem I have had with this particular brand of sunscreen is that it takes the outer layer of nail polish off my fingers. If I apply it while wearing a shiny polish and I am not careful, the polish will be completely matte and tacky by the time I am done.

"These bags are truly awesome. I highly recommend them for moving, especially if you are doing the move yourself and you have a limited amount of space. However, I they aren't ideal for using more than one time. Sometimes they work, but other times you come back to find your closet taken over by a giant comforter that suddenly became eight times the size because the bag gave out. I thought if I was just careful with the bags they wouldn't get holes in them, but they are somewhat fragile and this is difficult to do. They hold up well to even pressure, but the plastic is thin and very crinkly, and any sharp object or even just folding them too tightly can cause a break.

The swivel feature on the cord. It hasn't quit on me yet, but I can tell this is the first thing that is going to go. The unit won't always turn on unless I get the swivel in a specific position first. But, 1.5 years is still pretty good.A tip to deal with the unit cooling off: Once the flat iron reaches its desired heat setting, it changes the current to maintain that setting but doesn't take into account the fact that using it causes it to cool off. This can cause it to cool far below the set temperature. What you want is for it to be continuously heating as you use it. Set the temperature to one level below what you really want. Once it reaches this level, push the up button one more time and begin using it. It will likely never reach the next level because it will cool as you use it, and so it will continuously heat the whole time you use it. This will keep it much closer to your desire temperature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R294RN66KHT7NW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U5XS2O#wasThisHelpful","R294RN66KHT7NW","AN15B6AK28MMS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN15B6AK28MMS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had really high hopes for this highlighter given the excellent reviews, however, it doesn't seem to work on my skin type. Parts of my skin are dry and parts are oily, and my face is very pale (I'm always the lightest shade available for foundation). Instead of making my skin look luminous, instead it just looks both greasy and sparkly, like I decided to put sparkly eye shadow all over my face. I've tried different combinations of makeup underneath it but I can't seem to find a combination that works for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27F0Y7GBCZCTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EU6NK66#wasThisHelpful","R27F0Y7GBCZCTJ","AN15B6AK28MMS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN15B6AK28MMS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have borrowed this mascara from a friend several times before going out for the night. I am completely inept at putting fake lashes on, but I have no problem doing this. I think it actually looks better than fake lashes. You get a carrying case and two separate tubes. The first one they call the ""transplanting gel"" and the second one is the fiber lashes (box says they are made out of green tea leaves). You have to put your own mascara on first. You then do the gel, the lashes, then the gel again. The lashes tube looks like it is filled with little fuzzies. I agree with the other reviewer about the flakes. The second time I used this kit I put more gel on for the last application and then waited for several minutes trying not to blink. This helped a lot with the amount of flakes but didn't completely fix the problem.Pros:1. Easy to apply2. Lashes are significantly fuller and longer than with basic mascaraCons:1. Takes much longer to apply than regular mascara. About 10 mins total for me but I am a little slow.2.

"I have also used the base model Dyson V6 and the Hoover Linx. Dyson has now renamed all of their stick vacuums with ""v6"", so these are the original vacuums with new names. The major difference between the base model and this one is the extra attachments. It also has a special roller for hardwood floors and a higher end filter (which falls out a lot - sheesh). Other than the extra accessories, all the parts are the same high quality as the less expensive model. On the regular (non-turbo) setting the battery lasted 20 minutes and I could clean my wood floors but it didn't seem to do anything for the carpet. On turbo I get about 5 minutes but it doesn't give you any warning when you are about to run out, it just sort of dies.Another option if you don't want to spend so much on a vacuum is the Hoover: [...]. I have two cats and the Hoover handles pet hair much better, although the suction on carpet is slightly worse than the Dyson on turbo setting. With the Dyson, any time I save by not hauling out my upright is lost in time spent picking cat hair out of the roller, especially the hardwood piece.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14JT5EOMS40P0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLJPKA#wasThisHelpful","R14JT5EOMS40P0","AN15B6AK28MMS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN15B6AK28MMS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fabulous book that gently leads you to achieve your own health and wellness goals. Not overly scientific, easy to read and understand, and simple to follow the advice. I appreciated how well-rounded to book was, not simply focusing on diet and exercise, but on the bigger picture of well-being.I have read a lot of health and fitness books. Many of them cite numerous peer-reviewed articles in high profile journals supporting their story, but I find myself disappointed when I take a brief look online and see that what was printed in the book left out important details and facts that did not support the author's hypothesis. However, it's hard to argue with Buettner's work, based on studying the commonalities between communities with the highest concentration of 100 year olds who have grown old without suffering from the diseases that commonly plague our modern society (heart disease, obesity, cancer, diabetes). He immediately and wholeheartedly acknowledges that health and longevity is not simply about what you eat, but about a whole host of points which he terms the Power Nine.I am very happy to help support the Blue Zones Project which is actively helping communities around the country live healthier and happier lives.

"I bought this to use before my wedding. The pros:1. They work well, a noticeable difference2. You only have to do it 7 times3. They stay on really well (compared to previous versions) even if you are talking to someone4. The taste is much better than previous versionsA few cons:1. Holy geez did my teeth hurt by day 5. I don't consider myself someone with sensitive teeth, but I would get these random incredibly painful jolts in my mouth that were pretty unpleasant. It wasn't just in the few hours after using them, it was any time. This went away within a few days of finishing the last one.2. Two hours is a long time, but any stronger and I think it would be too difficult to tolerate3. For the cost, I didn't think the effect lasted that long. It's hard to tell because the whiteness fades gradually and depends on what you eat. For me I'd say it lasted a few months.Overall it did exactly what it was supposed to do.

"Why are these so cheap when they are so awesome? I have six of these frames in my house and they all look great. Yes the quality isn't the same as you would get for a significantly more expensive frame, but unless you put your nose right up against it you won't be able to tell. A few of mine have gotten dinged during moves but a quick application of a sharpie marker easily fixed the marks. One thing that is a little confusing is that it says 11 x 14 frame and then shows a floating document in the picture. 11 x 14 is the actual size of the frame, not the size of the floating document.

"I love this mix! I buy the three pack once every three months or so. I use it both to make bread but I also use it as a flour substitute in several recipes. There are also lots of recipes on the Pamela's website that you can try as well. It's one of the few mixes I have tried that doesn't have a grainy texture to it. The results also seem fairly robust to how it is prepared, whether by hand, with a mixer, different types of pans, etc. I like to use a non-stick loaf pan otherwise you can lose parts of it when you are getting it out. The trickiest part is getting the inside done without burning the top. If you have this issue I would suggest lowering the temperature by a small amount and increasing the time until the top gets golden brown. I have noticed that the price sometimes changes up and down by 15-20%. It's worth keeping an eye on if you buy regularly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1559ITUATI0FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001L4JH5I#wasThisHelpful","R1559ITUATI0FL","AN15B6AK28MMS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN15B6AK28MMS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Another exciting adventure with Nicholaas and his friend Pieter. This one finds Nicholaas and his family living in Arizona. Pieter has come to live with them for a short time. Both of the teenagers share a passion for baseball. The story alternates between the past and present with lots of interesting life lessons and adventures.At the outset Nicholaas and Pieter are playing a tension filled game of  baseball when they get an unexpected surprise; a vision of a blood moon with the image of Cochise imprinted on it. The boys will find themselves transported back in time. They will learn much about the honor and courage of this Native American warrior, as well as Rick Monday, a different kind of baseball hero who defended the American flag from dishonor.On a family visit to a ghost town, Nicholaas again steps back in time in the midst of a battle between Cochise and the white soldiers. A turquoise charm in his pocket allows him to be transported back to the present.The author nicely summarizes the end results of Nicholaas and his adventures in the present and future. Readers learn about honor, courage and bravery. Their lesson is not to fear losing their way, but to have faith in one's own determination and capabilities. Love the bright colorful illustrations. Recommended for readers ten and up who enjoy history, fantasy, travel, and adventure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11IQZZNYWYR12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517553733#wasThisHelpful","R11IQZZNYWYR12","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book contains exactly what the title says, two completely different dog stories. In both of them, man's best friend succeeds in making an important point. Ultimately that lesson will lead the young boy protagonist to learn something about himself as well as the dog character in the story.Plot of the first story features a boy named Alex and his Jack Russell Terrier pup, Bud. Like many children, Alex is finding walking his dog a task not high on his priority list. When he tries to combine the task with playing with his friends in the park, Bud gets into trouble. Alex unfairly blames Bud. But a visitor at school next day, teaches Alex to change his ways.In the second story, Peter is a shy boy who has few friends. When his parents inform him that they will be traveling to Italy, his fears are intensified. Ms. Muffin, his teacher, tries to encourage him. What happens to Peter when he gets to Italy, and how will his new friend influence his life when he gets back home?The book is targeted for ages five through twelve. In my opinion, it is most effective as an early independent reader. There are some illustrations, but they are rather small and stylized. Together with the length of the sentences, children in the five to seven age might find it hard to follow. Teachers might use the book in read aloud sessions for class discussion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R526NIXFQHSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZMN0PD2#wasThisHelpful","R3R526NIXFQHSN","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Third book in a series featuring a dragon named Spark and his owner Jed. Spark has recently returned from a secret mission; he lives in Jed's garage. He is suddenly startled with an eerie feeling that there is something he needs to tell Jed, but when he talks to Jed, Spark cannot remember. The rest of the story revolves around the upcoming Halloween holiday. Spark has never experienced this; Jed conspires with his friend, Nick, to come up with a scheme to scare Spark. The three make quite a sight in their Halloween costumes. While trick or treating, they meet someone Spark never suspected possible as well as a troll who poses a real threat. This story ends as a cliffhanger. Fans will need to wait until the next book in the series to see what happens.Arrangement of text and digital illustrations is unusual and interesting. The beginning of each chapter looks like a comic book. Then the author relates the rest of the story in longer sentences, as if a chapter book.

To make matters worse, his mom tells him that she has been offered a better job in London. He will have to leave his friends and home in Suffolk and move to the city.On the first day in his new school, the â€œpopular kidsâ€ make fun of Charlieâ€™s physical appearance and athletic abilities.

How can this possibly be a solution to his problem?This book contains seven short chapters whose length is perfect for children who are learning to read content independently.

"This is Book One of the Alexandra Fry detective series. Angella is a pretty ordinary twelve year old, who is nervous about starting the first day of seventh grade in a new middle school. She shares time with both of her divorced parents. At the beginning of the tale, readers are introduced to Alexandraâ€™s unique talent. She is able to see the ghosts of famous historical persons, who ask her help in solving mysteries. Alexandra has assisted Magellan in finding his lost compass and Abraham Lincoln in finding his stolen top hat. As if the first day in a new school isnâ€™t difficult enough, Alexandra is contacted by Queen Elizabeth I of England, who insists that if the family locket is not located, a curse will be visited upon the current community. Her classmates and teachers think that she is talking to herself.Fortunately for Elizabeth, her dad works in the City Museum. Her ability to gain easy access has helped her solve many cases in the past. In this mystery, she will be able to enlist the aid of a new friend, Penelope, and an eighth grader named Jack who at first appears to be more of a suspect than a friend. Alexandra must face the same issues most preteens face: bullying, fitting in with the crowd, negotiating their way with adults and asserting their independence. The author narrates a plot that has lots of twists and turns and combines elements of paranormal, history, mystery and adventure. Characters are believable and use authentic dialogue. The text is easy enough for preteens, but also is sophisticated enough for a young adult or adult reader. I was totally drawn into the mystery and felt empathy for the young characters.Readers age eight and older who enjoy history, mystery, detective, paranormal and coming of age books will all find something here to their liking. Look forward to the rest of the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FE5G4ERX9MF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149277541X#wasThisHelpful","R2FE5G4ERX9MF1","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a bit of difficulty deciding on a rating for this book. The plot is quite imaginative; I really do like that. An alien named Zigi who lives on the planet Nepi, frequently visits Earth because he has a fascination with stinky socks. The inhabitants of Nepi do not wear socks or shoes. So Zigi, goes to apartment buildings, beaches, the mall, and a kindergarten playground, among other places to seek his treasures.Zigi does not steal; he removes one sock and leaves moon rocks from his planet in exchange. But Zigi does not ask permission, and he does not explain how his victims fare the rest of the day with only one sock. Zigi also sees sunburn as magic because his skin goes back to normal once he is out of the sun. Parents and teachers will need to explain to young children, that it is wrong to take things without asking and that staying in the sun for long periods of time can be harmful for human children.On the other hand, the illustrations are easy for young children to follow and they will love the off beat humor. There are a few formatting issues: text and picture are not on the same page, and the size of the text changes on a few of the pages. Recommend the book for parents of preschoolers and young children who are careless about taking care of their belongings, and children who are intrigued with the concept of aliens from outer space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR4VC9PYPSOEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJEBM7Y#wasThisHelpful","RR4VC9PYPSOEB","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This author has a passion for explaining how to do things, and she displays a definite talent in this area. Adults who have always wanted to learn how to draw or those interested in helping children learn will find value in this book. The step by step approach laid out in the Table of Contents sets the tone for this book of approximately fifty pages.Williams tells her readers that drawing begins with a dot, then connecting the dots and proceeding to lines. She encourages us to surprise ourselves by allowing ourselves to scribble. Later we can train our eyes to see shapes in the objects around us. I found the section on artist tools helpful. Williams explains the need for an artistic pencil, erasers, sharpeners and the importance of using drawing paper with the proper weight. She cautions the budding artist not to draw from memory, train your eyes and always keep a drawing pad near you. The section on mistakes to avoid includes not throwing away your drawings and not to be afraid of darker values or outlines. As you become more proficient you can learn more about three dimensional forms as well as light and shadows. Drawing can be a fun activity; you do not need to possess great talent. It is a wonderful way to connect to the world and release your frustrations.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in learning to draw or to understand the basic elements of drawing Children ages ten and up should be able to handle the text independently or the book can be used as a joint adult and child teaching tool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBLH2Q71YGO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Y5UD0M#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBLH2Q71YGO7","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author targets this book for children ages three to seven. Simple plot centers on three bunny brothers and how they spend a Saturday morning. Their mom tells them she will be visiting granny; they will be staying home with dad. Then she gives them a list of suggestions as to how to spend the day, asking only that they clean their room before she returns. She elicits a promise to comply, and leaves a special dessert for them. Of course the three bunnies procrastinate in cleaning, thinking they have plenty of time left. When Jimmy goes to the room and cannot find his basketball, he cannot find it. What do the boys decide to do? Will they get their room cleaned up in time?Although the lesson of responsibility is a good one, the plot is fairly predictable. The text font and size of illustrations are rather small for younger children. I could not enlarge it on my kindle HD fire. Recommended as a bedtime story or read aloud, particularly for parents of children who don't enjoy cleaning up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PQ13BEO1YQDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME04N70#wasThisHelpful","R2PQ13BEO1YQDW","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cute story about a Jack-o-lantern named Bob. This pumpkin was carved by a nine year old girl while she was bobbling for apples at a Halloween party. Bob hates his name; he doesn't sound very scary. Isn't that what Jack-o-lanterns are supposed to do on Halloween? Together with his friend, a cat named Bubbles, he scours the neighborhood trying to square other creatures like a spider, mouse and a dog. Finally, Bob meets an owl who tells him to use the one thing that makes him special to scare children. Puzzled by this, Bubbles and Bob try to figure out what that is. Will they succeed before Halloween arrives and they run out of time?This book is a good fit for preschoolers, even though the sentences are a bit long and the adult reader might need to paraphrase. The digital illustrations are colorful and cute. The book is in need of some editing, which probably won't bother most readers. Teachers and parents might choose this one as a change of pace in Halloween stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ADATLDOFBG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DTF49E#wasThisHelpful","R3ADATLDOFBG8","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She tries to avoid thinking about the long wait time and tries to find activities to amuse her and pass the time. Then catastrophe strikes when she knocks down the suits of armor lined up along the castle wall. Nancy is a princess; she does not need to pick up after herself, but she feels guilty. How does Nancie handle her problem? Will we get to see her dancing at the ball?The book is targeted for children under the age of six. It will teach young children an important lesson about responsibility. This book of approximately twenty pages is written in rhyme. There are a few spots where the rhythm is a bit off. The story does seem to end a bit abruptly, leaving the reader wanting to know more.

"Bubbles is a cute frog with a serious problem. It seems that no matter what he eats, he makes bubbles in the pond. Bloop! Bloop! His stinky farts don't make him popular with the other frogs in the pond. Eventually, they ask him to leave. Then one day some boys arrive at the pond site determined to catch frogs. Bubbles dreams about their plight. Should he try to save them?The book is targeted for three to seven year olds; story line will probably appeal to the upper end of that range. The illustrations are simple and the plot is predictable.. Children who like humorous, quirky books will probably like it. Not the type of book to read and reread.

"Four stories centering on familiar themes and characters with surprise endings. Each story features one protagonist speaking to the reader in first person. The first story showcases a frog who was once a king now trying to woo his sweetheart. In the second book, a little chickadee discovers there is a certain someone that he cannot get off his mind. How can he tell her that he loves her? The third book features a rather self-centered Easter bunny who is attempting to train the â€œnew guy.â€ He gives a lot of history about the Easter bunny and what it takes to fill the job. Finally in the fourth book, a robot from the planet Infinim, which is a replica of earth, is interviewing candidates who want to be robots for his planet. Readers will be surprised at the current candidate who is interviewing for the position. Who is he and will he make the cut?The photos and illustrations are delightful. While the stories feature somewhat familiar characters, the clever surprise endings will delight both the child and adult reader. Each story is about the average length of a picture book. These tales are targeted for the three to six age audience, but older children will appreciate the subtleties and clever twists. The collection is a nice set of bedtime stories or family read aloud. Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S72CXYEI3ZJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TVG0O32#wasThisHelpful","R3S72CXYEI3ZJA","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clever, humorous and well-written detective mystery targeted for late elementary and middle school readers. I must admit the plot kept me guessing and entertained. Chapters are short and easy to read. Pencil sketches are an added bonus. I particularly enjoyed the way that the authors found a way to integrate those dreaded hard to solve math word problems right into the story line. As a bonus, the reader is presented with a few more problems to solve at the conclusion of the mystery. They can check their answers on the authorsâ€™ website.Felix, Gertie, Stanley and Charlotte are a bright group of sixth graders who become interested in forming a detective agency. Using Felixâ€™s tree house as a base of operations, Felix attempts to find out who is stealing his food from the kitchen by using his binoculars. When Charlotte brings a police scanner up to the house, they hear about an armed robbery at the local jewelry store. The budding detectives rush to the scene. They discover the owner Mr. Franklin has been hit on the head and his most valuable possession, the Claymore diamond, has been stolen. Police apprehend a suspect quickly, and the case appears closed. Our four young detectives believe otherwise; they refuse to quit until what had appeared obvious is revealed as erroneous.Lots of twists and turns in the plot. The characters are believable and authentic middle grade students. Readers will find themselves enjoying the math challenges that come along with the case. Great way to get students involved with math while reading. Look forward to reading new books in the series as they are released.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTB80OVXM9ET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2AMVW4#wasThisHelpful","R2CTB80OVXM9ET","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In these three adventures, Jack succeeds in foiling a robbery, solves a detective mystery, and resolves his loneliness problem by finding a new friend in a most unlikely way.The kindle book has a few editing and formatting issues.

"The author is not trying to reinvent the wheel, but to collate and abridge a nice assortment of stories from around the world in five to seven minute segments. Just the right size for a busy mom or dad for a bedtime story read. They are suitable for school age children ages six through twelve and are not meant for toddlers or preschoolers. While all of them have familiar themes to many cultures; â€˜The Emperorâ€™s New Clothesâ€ will probably be recognized by all readers.I think my favorite of these ten is the one titled, â€œThe Story Without an End.â€ It tells the legend of a king who lived in a time before there were printed storybooks. This king had an insatiable appetite for stories. After a while, his subjects ran out of stories to tell. The king promised that whoever would tell a story that did not end could marry the princess. Unfortunately, if the story ended, that storyteller would be thrown in jail.One day a poor farmer showed up with the promise of a story without end. But first the king had to promise to listen to the end. After receiving that promise from the king, the farmer began his tale, which was so cleverly crafted that it went on for months. When the king could take it no longer, he begged the farmer to stop telling his story. So the farmer married the princess and eventually ruled the kingdom.Each story is accompanied by a black and white pencil drawing to complement the tale. This is a nice touch and provides encouragement of more discussion on the topic of each story. Creative and novel way for parent and child or teacher and child to share a short read aloud. Look forward to reading Book 2 in the collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L89F2LVHSJ3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W22Q7WO#wasThisHelpful","R1L89F2LVHSJ3U","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is not a biography or carefully researched book about military history. Rather it is a book with a very specific point of view on how to set out to achieve your goals. In fact, the first quarter of the book deals with the theory that the simplest way to defeat obstacles that stand in your way and to systematically accomplish the goals you set for yourself is to be as determined in your drive as Alexander the Great. Patrickâ€™s theory states that if you do this, you will show your bravery and tenacity to your opponents, who will then lose the will to keep fighting you.The middle section of this book retells the events of Alexanderâ€™s campaigns. Patrick consistently presents Alexander in a favorable light, largely discounting other reasons for success or failure. Finally the last third of the book explains what the author calls The Power of Purpose. All of us should learn from Alexanderâ€™s journey to greatness that to be successful the reader needs to do the following: strengthen her will by having a clear purpose, put that purpose into motion, and then follow through to reach the goal by never relenting or giving up on it.This is an interesting theory, if you are looking for inspiration and motivation. On the other hand, if you are expecting to find a book based on meticulous historical research or an accurate portrait of Alexanderâ€™s life, this one will not fill your expectations. At approximately fifty pages, it is a short motivational read for young adults and adult readers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SE78RWTXYCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRRFZUO#wasThisHelpful","R3SE78RWTXYCJ","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dicks has done his research on a controversial topic; he presents it in a straightforward and objective fashion. This book is not a sci-fi tale of invasion of the earth by little green men. In this book of approximately eighty pages, the author covers a lot of territory.To summarize briefly, readers will learn about the exact location and historical background of Area 51. They will learn about the earliest projects dating back to the 1940â€™s and 1950â€™s like the A-12 Spy Plane and the Lockheed U-2, plus other projects that have been rumored tested there. The author explores the conspiracy theories, and the rumored alien crash at Roswell, NM. He discusses mysterious cleanup activities around the base. I found the discussion about ancient texts around the world and DNA analysis interesting. Dicks discusses the testimony of those who claimed to have seen aliens including astronauts and pilots from the US and Russia. Perhaps the most controversial part of the book is the work of Dr. Dan Burisch and the Lotus Project which discuss aliens as human intelligences from the future.Whether you believe in aliens or not, this book is a well-written analysis on the subject of Area 51. Appropriate for readers ages twelve and older, I am sure that budding middle grade scientists and sci-fi fans interested in the subject will be able to handle the text.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359ST8GQJJPVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1GE9W8#wasThisHelpful","R359ST8GQJJPVJ","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author has her pulse on the middle school audience. Gabby Gibson, the protagonist, is the perfect heroine. Gabbyâ€™s dad has passed away, but she follows in his footsteps as detective par excellence.She is a seventh grader at Preston Middle School who experiences many of the problems that her young readers face. There is gossip among the girls, bullying, the nerds, those perceived to be the haves and the have-nots. The dialogue is funny and authentic. Readers will laugh and cry with the characters and their foibles. Student and adult characters share equally the laughter and the criticism.Plot centers around the mystery of how the Panda mascot of Preston Middle School got his head cut off at an important soccer game, and how the money for the annual seventh grade dance went missing. When the dance is canceled by principal, Mr. Sauerbutts, Gabby kicks her detective skills into high gear. There are enough twists and turns to keep the plot interesting. Our detective thinks she has the answer, but discovers she was wrong. Will Gabby solve the mystery and save the dance? Does the Panda mascot find his head?At just under two hundred pages, the book is a nice fit for readers ages nine and up.

"The subtitle in this book sums it up: motivate yourself when no one else can. It is easy to sit back, find excuses and do nothing. That just leads to further frustration. There is not a lot of new material in this book, but the author does an excellent job of summarizing what needs to be done and effective ways to implement your goals.Collins begins by explaining procrastination, why we do it, and the damage it can cause. Next the reader is encouraged to take charge, believe in himself and take the steps to pull out of his lethargy. These include prioritizing, focusing on task, planning, breaking tasks into time blocks, and setting deadlines. Finally, the reader is encouraged to implement self-discipline, establish routines, and reward himself when successful.This is a great little book to keep handy whenever you feel yourself slipping into the doldrums or finding your desk a helpless mire of unfinished tasks.

"I have mixed emotions about this story. Narrated in first person by a little girl, the story is divided into two parts. In the first half, our little narrator presents rhymes of four lines per page with some of the reasons her grandpa might be cranky.  While the illustrations are adorable and funny, some parents may feel they are too graphic especially for very young children. For example,  losing his teeth in the toilet bowl and falling asleep because it is too difficult to cut his long toenails. The second part of this story relates how the little girl has so many reasons to appreciate her grandpa like how he supports her emotionally, spends time with her, and has unlimited patience. Her conclusion is that he is not grumpy, but just getting old.The book is targeted for readers ages two through eight. Toddlers and preschoolers won't understand the underlying message.

"Quite a mouthful for a title! Most any parent would say they want all these things for a child, yet delivering them is by no means an easy task. The author of this book is not revealing new information, but organizing and structuring it in an easy to read, practical guide.The book is divided into fourteen chapters starting with the big picture and working toward specific steps for implementation. At the outset parents must believe in their children, ensuring that they donâ€™t feel inadequate, celebrating their successes and avoiding nagging. Parents need to understand why school is important by building up a childâ€™s dreams, discussing the future and helping them to discover their own passions and talents. Then parents can follow through by setting realistic but high expectations and helping children move toward them.In the later sections of the book, the author explains the importance for the child to listen to the teacher and how parents can encourage that. Ambe insists that achievement is tied to a love of reading, which spills over into all subjects of the curriculum. She explains the importance of completing homework, maintaining a good structure at home by establishing routines, doing extra credit work and practicing for tests. I found the section on math interesting. Ambe stresses the importance of mastering math skills in the early elementary grades and urges parents to visit the school to ensure those supports are in place. Other important areas for parents are teaching character and integrity through personal example, demanding accountability, and communicating empathy. Parents will help a child find balance and provide discipline by seeking the right extracurricular activities to instill motivation and leadership qualities. Above all, the parents themselves must put their best foot forward as mentally and physically stable role models who pursue their own passions and goals.At the end of each of the fifteen short chapters, parents are give a short exercise by answering pertinent questions about their own child to help reinforce the content of that section. These can serve as a kind of notebook or reference guide. This book of approximately one hundred pages belongs on every parent and guidance counselorâ€™s bookshelf. I found the common sense and practical guide valuable and easy to follow. Wish I had this when my children were still in school.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13Q52JKDZGHVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1507685718#wasThisHelpful","R13Q52JKDZGHVP","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this may be my favorite book in The Oliver and Jumpy series. In the first story young readers are taken on a wild adventure with Loci, the locomotive turned roller coaster. Passengers get more than they bargained for as they are taken under the sea, through a land of giants, and a cavern filled with fire-breathing dragons. The second story involves Oliver's plight with uncontrollable hiccups. When he remembers the legend of a deep flower hidden in the jungle that provides food for the hiccup bird, he is forced to become a mountain climber. Can Oliver successfully disguise himself as a hiccup chick, find a cure, and return home safely? The third adventure finds Uncle Oliver having breakfast with Joey, his young kangaroo friend. They decide to go fishing in a rowboat on the nearby lake. What happens when Joey gets impatient?Cenizal does a wonderful job illustrating the cast of characters which include sharks, mermaids, dragons and giants. Their facial expressions are priceless. Preschoolers will love them. If you haven't read any of the stories in this series, I recommend that you start with this one. You can read all three stories in one sitting or break them up into individual bedtime stories. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCGGVYKBK37BC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PV9Y7RC#wasThisHelpful","RCGGVYKBK37BC","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not disappointed with this poetry collection. Children will delight in the variety of subjects and clever rhyme. Some of these poems address ordinary objects like lunch and rocks. Others address fears like being sick and cowering in a thunderstorm. One of the funniest poems is the very first, â€œConfusion.â€ It addresses the many complexities and anomalies of the English language.I gave up the fight and called it a night It really didnâ€™t matter if write wasnâ€™t right All those words are still in my head Iâ€™ve got an idea! Iâ€™ll learn German instead!A few of the poems deal with growing up issues like personal appearance, wanting straight hair instead of curly or â€œThe Joy of Boys.â€ Some poems illustrate our deepest feelings like the loss of a loved one in â€œThe Legacy, â€ or exploring magical memories left to us by a loved one in â€œGrandmaâ€™s Magical Pot.â€ Children who have never even tried to write down their thoughts in a poem might be encouraged to do so following the simple format of the poem titled simply, â€œI Like.â€I donâ€™t ordinarily read the poetry genre but have to admit I really enjoyed reading these poems. Adults will have just as much reading them as a child being introduced to them for the first time. Recommended for children ages eight and up and for readers of any age who enjoy reflecting on the simple things in life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZZMPTDTYBU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1Y8V2E#wasThisHelpful","R1QZZMPTDTYBU5","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While travelling home, the boy remembers that his Uncle Troy asked him for a piece so he travels to the desert. He continues his journey encountering many obstacles but always remaining generous.

"This is the author's first book featuring a nonfiction topic, the metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly. Story features a boy named Dave who has a pet caterpillar, Wiggles. Dave and his father take us through the stages; eventually Dave realizes that it is time for his pet to go free.I like the idea of comparing the caterpillar's life cycle to the maturation process of a child. Dave's father has a powerful message for his child. This book is targeted for children ages 4-16; the illustrations are large simple and cartoon-like. However, the text includes many sentences approaching twenty words in length, and vocabulary words like lurked, transformed, abundance and succulent are too sophisticated for very young children. While they may be able to follow the pictures, an adult will need to explain the text. For these reasons, I would recommend the book especially for children who have mastered beginning reading skills; most third and fourth graders would be comfortable with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S05T6WA420L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0138PCTA2#wasThisHelpful","R2S05T6WA420L0","A2GCEOF7KVQK1U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GCEOF7KVQK1U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Her mother is busy reading, Mom ignores Suzieâ€™s important question, â€œWhy are we flying backwards?â€ When Suzie gets up to walk to the back of the plane, she notices a group of people dressed in robes and hoods. A young girl asks her if she is bored and would like to play.

When a series of earthquakes and volcanoes threaten the kingdom, she and Allaya will have to fight for their lives, caught in a death struggle with the forces of nature, the dragons, and the lizards who have arisen again from the sea. Will Suzie be able to escape with her life a second time? Does the kingdom survive? Will Suzie ever get back to her own time and family on twenty-first century earth?The characters are appealing and interesting, and the plot elements just intricate enough to hold interest and keep the story moving along, although there are a few instances where there might have been a bit less dialogue.

"Okay, I have occasionally been accused of being a sourpuss and not possessing the best sense of humor. However, I must admit this book had me grinning from ear to ear. Targeted for readers age seven and up, I know that the fifth grade students that I used to teach would be fighting over who gets to read this first. None of the jokes are complicated to remember; children can memorize and quiz peers and adults easily. Many of them are easy to figure out, but others are a bit more sophisticated The subjects are varied, but all are done in good, clean fun.Perfect book for a long car ride, party games, or a read aloud with family members.

"This SmartLab contains a lens that you can clip onto your smartphone to take close-up pictures. I used it on my iPhone 6. You clip the lens onto the phone. It does not stay firmly in place and tends to move if you bump it. There is a light on the lens which is just strong enough to light up the image. This lens is a bit tricky to use. You have to zoom in all the way with the phone and then try to focus. The objects tend to go in and out of focus if you are not using a tripod. Itâ€™s hard to hold the phone steady enough to get good focus at that magnification. A little tripod would solve that problem. I like the little booklet that comes with this lens. It has lots of different ideas or experiments that you can do with this lens. There is also a slide included that contains a microprinting, a fruitfly and a microchip.

"This game is easy to learn. It can be a lot of fun to playâ€¦..or, it can be really awkward and inappropriate, depending on the ages of the people playing. I thought the question on the box about the pig and bear would be a typical question, in other words, fun and silly scenarios that elementary school to middle school aged kids would find fun to play. But there were many questions that were geared towards adults and the kids would either not know how to answer them, or they would just plain be inappropriate for them. The questions should be geared towards one age group. They should not try to be all things to all people. The adults will just find the silly questions too juvenile and the kids will find many questions just do not apply or they do not understand them.I played this with my nieces (ages around 10, 11). They had fun overall, especially with all the silly questions about burping and farts, or eating bugs vs. tapeworms, etc.  We had to skip several cards that just did not make sense to them (like questions about the NBA) or were inappropriate (like drinking from a keg, or having the butt of the person next to them, or about being overweight). This game is labeled for 12 and up. I certainly donâ€™t think any 12 year old should contemplate drinking from a keg! I think most of the questions are okay, but if they had narrowed the questions down to a specific age group, this game would have been so much better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LZMZCOLBUVMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGR5G3U#wasThisHelpful","R3LZMZCOLBUVMK","A1X3ESYZ79H59E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X3ESYZ79H59E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This game is fairly quick and easy to learn how to play. There are 2 different difficulty levels to choose from. You are supposed to use either the 3 tile side or the 4 tile side for all players, but I think that if you have different aged players you could even have the younger kids use the 3 tile side while the older players use the 4 tile side to even the playing field. That way the different skill levels can play at the same time. This game is fun to play if you like puzzles like Tetris. If you really donâ€™t like puzzles you may find this game to be too frustrating. The timed rounds make the play more fun and exciting.The puzzle pieces are made of a thick durable cardboard.

There so much to see along that famous path, and if youâ€™re ever lucky enough to do it then this book would be great to have with you so you donâ€™t miss a thing.

"Because I can use this as a multi-purpose modifier for a monolight, bare bulb flash, or speedlight, its value to me far exceeds its cost.  It can be used as a gridded reflector, semi-soft reflector/box (with only the internal baffle), or double diffused soft box - plus, with a minor DIY addition, you can make it a beauty dish.  So whether you need a wide, soft spread or a more directional, sharp light this tool delivers in degrees depending on how you choose to set it up.Perhaps the best feature is its parabolic shape, which is tight and efficient.  Shallower modifiers don't focus the light nearly as well.  Despite the many advantages listed above, I would not have bought this if it didn't have such a deep parabol.  Similarly shaped boxes/umbrellas/dishes are uncommon and costly.Many negative reviews here are narrowly focused on the umbrella mechanism, but I see it as a post to mount a round dish reflector on to cool the center hot spot.  I realize that if someone needed to break this down after each shoot then they would encounter problems with it consistently latching/locking and holding open (sooner or later).  But I am able to keep it assembled so it's not a problem.  Even if the latch on the shaft failed, I think it would be an easy fix to clamp or tie the mechanism so that it stays open.I have never purchased a strobe/flash modifier from CowboyStudio before and, frankly, they seem to be an entry-level brand so I shopped around to find alternatives to this before pulling the trigger.  The alternatives either had fewer positive attributes or they were the same with a higher cost.  The Paul C. Buff folding octabox is probably better quality, but with a grid it costs four times as much - and I don't shoot with their lights.I've been doing advanced lighting for years with all manner of modifiers, but this one is like a really cool Swiss Army knife.  I'm excited to have gotten it for so cheap, too.  Totally recommended for lighting enthusiasts...","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YXCUKEVUTXCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8NMN96#wasThisHelpful","R2YXCUKEVUTXCH","A2Q204DY2L7YRP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q204DY2L7YRP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The description of this mount as ""multifunctional"" is important to note, because the images (as of the time of this review) don't fully show how this can be used.  You should observe that the bracket has both 3/8"" and 1/4"" threaded holes to attach your spigot / stud to, which can be very helpful in using speedlights.  With common adapters, this mount can be placed on stands, doors, tables, etc. and used for adding light in precarious places.Also, I must add that, since I already own several dedicated mounts with studs, this new style mount has an opening (or mouth, so to speak) that is significantly wider than is common.  It opens about 3/4"" wider than the other C-type mounts with studs that I have used for years.  This means you can attach it to larger poles, stands, tables, doors, car windows, etc. than the typical mounts allow for, thus making it more useful overall.Yes, the main reason I bought it was to secure my power pack for the AD-360 (which it does very well).  But the fact that it has multiple functions makes this mount much more valuable than other screw-type mounts with studs.  The value is there, in my opinion, so I would highly recommend this...","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84WX4RX6NE6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBV9HY0#wasThisHelpful","R84WX4RX6NE6X","A2Q204DY2L7YRP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q204DY2L7YRP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Early on, you could manage it with regular picking, brushing, or using wide tape to grab the small tufts.  Soon it became a losing battle because the pilling effect was more widespread and the individual tufts were harder to remove.

"Looks like I found my new, favorite hot sauce!  I tried it once at a friend's house and just fell in love with it, and was so glad to find these 10 ounce bottles on amazon for a decent price.Habanero sauces, in my experience, have tended to be too riddled with vinegar, too mild, or too hot.  This 'white label' version of Marie Sharp's (there are many she makes, but I haven't tried those) strikes the perfect balance of solid flavor, mild-to-medium heat, and no punishing aftertaste.  Every time I use it, I apply what seems like a lot on my food - and then I eventually add still more because it's so good and doesn't kill the natural food taste or your tongue.From Belize, Mary Sharp's sauce is like ketchup down there and for good reason.  It really has a unique taste that even non-hot sauce people can appreciate.  I would rate the 'heat' index here at a 4 out of 10, and the flavor at least a 9!

"We love to watch this show as a family and tell many others about it as well.  Shark Tank has many learning possibilities for young and old which are almost nonexistent in network television (or anywhere else).Both for wise business as well as certain life lessons, the cases explored in these shows can be very helpful.  From half-baked ideas of new entrepreneurs to emotionally compromised investors, the negative lessons offer many cautions.  And, of course, there are some 'slam dunk' cases that are inherently good for both the entrepreneur as well as the shark investors.While I feel the entertainment factor in Shark Tank is subordinate to the real world lessons to be garnered, there are plenty of moments full of comedy, surprise, and controversy.  The producers get a wild variety of entrepreneurs that make it interesting for most audiences.  Heck, by watching it you might even find a product, service, or business opportunity you wouldn't have discovered otherwise.From season one up to five, there has been improvements in many aspects.  Better sharks helps a lot (fewer guest sharks who do little more than sit) but I'd like to see at least one rotate off per season.  Better follow-up stories in the 'updates' allow the viewer to feel more connected to the stories.  Better production too, especially from season one to two.Overall, we highly recommend this show for real world examples of risk, reward, and proper business strategies.

"This taco bowl form is fantastic for making fresh shells for salads.  A bit of instructions would have been nice (but at least the reviews here helped a lot).  No doubt, this thing is commercial grade because it's built like a tank and can be used on the big 12 inch tortillas.  I especially like that the base is rather large in terms of diameter so that your shells can be filled with dinner-sized portions.I used my large fryer to test it out with and it's fine, but I'm thinking next time I'll try to use a large round pot with tall sides instead.  The reason is that my fryer has the heating elements on the bottom and I was constantly pressing the tortilla down there to fully submerge the shell - and so the bottom of the shell more cooked than the rest.  It didn't effect the taste at all so it's no big deal.As has been said before, you don't put the tortilla inside of the form/basket.  You put it in the oil and then press down with this shell maker directly in the center of the tortilla.  The tortilla will be shaped upward and wrap itself around the form as it cooks.My shells took about one minute to fully cook and harden at 375 degrees in peanut oil.  Just keep a set of tongs in one hand to grab the shell with, shake off, and drain on paper towels.  325-350 might be better next time (to make golden, flaky shells instead of light brown ones) but it will take a little longer to make.Also, I'm thinking that next time I'll use uncooked, fresh tortillas to see if they turn out more crisp and flaky than ones made from cooked white flower tortillas.

This brand isn't one I've ever purchased before so I cannot speak to their quality over a range of products, but this one is just what I was looking for.My neurologist swears that humans cannot absorb more than a half of a milligram of melatonin so he implored me to get the smallest dose possible.  These are the smallest dose I could find unless you get some proprietary blend - and even then they load you up with too much melatonin.Although I'm pleased with this purchase and would buy again I'm docking a star because I feel the price is a bit steep for such a common product that's widely available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XFLMQK6ZM34M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009P7CVW4#wasThisHelpful","R2XFLMQK6ZM34M","A2Q204DY2L7YRP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q204DY2L7YRP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went through a long season where I was bedridden and had a hard time sleeping.  Going through many types of pillows was part of the problem, but I was so glad to have discovered these.  The foam is in small chunks or pieces and so can be moved around to a desirable shape.  Generally speaking, it's firmer than down feather pillows but softer than the solid foam pillows that are so common.  I'm on my third set of pillows now and cannot imagine a good night's rest without them.My only complaint is that they don't make a king sized version of the pillows.

"This tube is really a great tool for adding smoke to your standard grilling or just plain old cold smoking meats and cheeses.  Because it's not meant to flame up, the smouldering pellets can give off hours of rich smoke without getting hot.  And clean up is easy and fast too.The trick is to place it far away from any potential drafts so that the pellets don't wick up into a flame, which in my case required me to tape over some holes in my barbecue in order to create a 'sweet spot' for it to rest when smoking.  Also, if you don't get a sufficient burn initially then don't be surprised if you come back an hour later to find it not emitting smoke.  Use one of those refillable torch-style lighters and really burn the end of the pellets so that the flame would remain lit on its own, and then blow it out to begin the smoke process.If you're on the fence, I'd say watch some online videos and then just go for it...","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKRY4YL5Z0RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CS6YFIC#wasThisHelpful","RJKRY4YL5Z0RW","A2Q204DY2L7YRP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q204DY2L7YRP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I didn't know that a product like this existed (other than those rigid flossing toothpicks that are too large) and so was amazed after my dentist gave me a trial pack.  The tips are not only small/thin enough to fit between the teeth near the gums but they are coated with a thin layer of what seems to be latex - which gives it a rubbery texture to grab onto whatever needs to be removed.My only complaint is that if you don't try inserting the tip at just the right angle then the tip will bend (at least in my case where tight fits are everwhere).

"I got this as part of a larger kit a while back and it's use has exceeded the original needs.  Now I use it mostly on location, handheld by an assistant, and with modified flashguns.  Because it's light (being made of rigid aluminum tubing) it's not terribly difficult to hold out while in full extension in order to get more challenging shots.  And the lock stops on both the head and the extension part have never slipped even when under heavy load.A perfect complement to this would be the Lastolite LL LS2499 Waist Holder, which I'm looking at now.  It would made hold this boom over long jobs easier and more stable.While aluminum will bend a bit, if you're mounting a huge softbox to a monolight it might make more sense to get that chrome one from Westcott since it's very rigid (I use this in studio) and can easily manage the heaviest loads.I know that I will get another one of these eventually, and I have no hesitation recommending it...","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N7IJ25J0QYPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024NKGKK#wasThisHelpful","R2N7IJ25J0QYPH","A2Q204DY2L7YRP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q204DY2L7YRP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With my Nikon D800, I was using the fastest SD card I could find while using my older, slower CF cards in the second slot as backup.  I began having the 'freeze' or 'hang' problem where after making an exposure the rear monitor would lock up, showing only the hanging hour glass.  Only waiting for an indefinite period of time or a hard shut down would clear this writing error.  After doing a lot of research and trying to find out what others were doing to remedy the problem (since sending the body to Nikon wasn't resolving things for others who tried) the one thing people said cured the issue was to switch to CF priority.These 1000x cards from Transcend are their best/fastest so I knew it had the greatest potential to write files without the hanging hour glass freeze.  Once I got the card and made the switch in the menu system, the issue hasn't come back once.  So kudo to transcend for making a fast card at a reasonable price.

"For digital post-process work, this panel is a bargain. Of course, I always use a hardware calibrator so my review is predicated on that sort of correction being applied. And once dialed in, the depth of color and dynamic range is pro level, and I would put this next to most IPS LED monitors and see it lacks nothing essential.I'm impressed at how it handles blacks too, blowing away my old samsung LED. No light leaks on my model either. From a cold state to warm up, I notice no shift in tone, saturation, or brightness.Refresh rates for gaming/movies is not what it was designed to be optimal for. And I haven't/don't use it in the vertical portrait orientation so I cannot speak to that function.After using it for extended sessions for a few weeks now, I'd say I'm totally satisfied.

"These 'miracle-in-a-bottle' things can get reviews from all over the place, both positive and negative, so I don't want to join the extreme voices here. My experience is based on necessity since the winter fuel here in the northwest is so lousy that all of our vehicles start rough and burn hard. The awful performance is most obvious when you need to suddenly accelerate hard and the vehicle misfires or stutters (it's so lame, and I don't know who to be more upset at - the government or the fuel companies).So I tried a couple of the 5.25 ounce bottles of this Lucas fuel stuff in two or our rigs and the main thing I noticed was that things are smoother, as you'd expect in normal circumstances. Now I bought the gallon version and am refilling these smaller bottles and using it full time (pencils out to be about a buck a treatment doing it this way) and it's been about five tanks. Definitely smoother but not noticing any savings in the miles per gallon department yet. Perhaps on long trips where it's mostly freeway mileage? Don't know and really don't care.

"Finally got around to polishing the old, fogged up lenses on my 2005 ride with a 3M kit from amazon.  But I didn't want to go to all that trouble and just conclude after using their rubbing compound (which made a big difference after the 3000 grit polishing stage).  So after researching for some sort of final polish that would also protect the lens, I decided meguiar's was probably the amazon crowd favorite upon reading a bunch of reviews.I used the same sponge head adapted for application with drill that came with the 3M kit (just wash/rinse well before using the meguiar product) which made this final step rather quick and easy.  The results were noticeably more clear and 'new looking' afterwards, which is exactly what I was hoping for.  There's enough left over to do the job many times over.This product worked great, but I've got nothing else to compare it with - and I don't know how long the 'new look' will last so I reserving a star.

There's so many of these things here on amazon and so researching the top five or so paid off.  Volume of reviews was an asset here, as well as longevity of brand of make.  It wasn't a risk to get this one by medialink via prime, knowing it could easily be returned.Not taking cost into account, I just wanted a version that was a simple USB edition, had rather recent firmware, and was tested by many before me.  After the quick shipment, it took a couple minutes to install the firmware from the included cd.  Assuming I would have to update the firmware after getting things up and running, I was pleasantly surprised that the disc already had the latest firmware. All told, the process took about three minutes from initially plugging in of the device to setting the adapter as my default in windows device manager via the control panel.  Not bad at all.So I immediately went to speedtest dot net and tested out at 28mbps download speed - which is almost six times as fast as the old built-in adapter speed was giving me with the same router/broadband service.

Since these are being used for basketball and they have a drawstring, cinching up a little is no problem.  The quality and price are fairly good overall.  Nothing spectacular but a solid deal.

"Recently purchased these for a 2011 Camry XLE and I was a little skeptical because the price was a bit lower than the weathertech ones (which seemed solid, based on a friend's experience, but look too boxy and lacking the custom contour).  The contours are molded well to fit the floors with only slight gapping on the very edges, which might go away over time when they relax a bit more.I'm docking them a star because the description seemed to stretch the bounds of reality (described as 'rubberized non-slip material' when it feels a whole lot like plastic) and the driver's side front liner wasn't notched out for the trunk/fuel door latches (the image represents this accurately).  Not a real problem to cut out my own notches with a utility knife, but I was hoping for a softer 'rubberized' finish like my older Honda Pilot has.Overall, they look good, feel durable, and at this price I'd generally recommend them.--UPDATE 3/2/14--After several weeks of mild use in my 2011 Camry, I'm very disappointed that the outer edges of both front and rears liners are shrinking away from the natural floor contours.  Now they look like a misfit and not very custom.  And this is surprising since they fit well and looked great initially.  At this price, for what is mostly plastic molded in an automated form process, the price should be less or the quality should be improved.What's worse is that now I've just recently passed the 30 day return period there is no recourse and I'm stuck with these for awhile.

"I got the 64gig card on a special day-only sale so I am fully satisfied by the value itself, even if the speed is questionable.Anything by Sandisk is going to have a certain degree of performance and that speaks well of the brand regardless of the grade of memory you're buying. In short, an average Sandisk card is going to fare better overall against a supposedly faster competitor (not named Lexar).My only gripe, and the reason I docked it a star, is the read time. Normally it's the write times that are exaggerated and problematic but the opposite is true here. In a newer DSLR with more information per image and faster frame rates, the card will write decently and not lag. But when copy/pasting image files from the card into storage drives the performance just doesn't live up to the 'extreme' name. Using current USB 3.0 gear throughout my system, the bottleneck when moving files has to be the card itself. And the fastest transfer rate I've gotten when pushing RAW files is 41 mbps. This is much slower than it should be, frankly.Overall, I'd recommend the card as a fine compromise of modest speed and great space for a relatively low cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8OQJ9IGA0D44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DN43RCI#wasThisHelpful","R8OQJ9IGA0D44","A2Q204DY2L7YRP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q204DY2L7YRP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've only been using this for a week now but it's performing on par with the others from Nikon I've used over the years (MB-D10 most recently).  It fits securely, even if the front doesn't fully contour around the base of the lens mount.  Because I only use the 8 AA battery portion I can say it fits smoothly into the grip with no wiggling, and the slots for each battery is fitted fine (not too tight, as was the case with another knock-off I tried).The front and rear command dials work just as you'd expect, but I noticed the resistance on each is slightly less than Nikon's own.  This isn't a problem for me but some might think it indicates something is wrong when it really isn't.AF-ON works perfectly and the shutter release is spot on.  The little thumb joystick knob is small and susceptible to minor mistakes in pressure angle - exactly like Nikon's own - so nothing gained or lost here.Overall, I'd say it's a great value but only time will tell.  I stopped using Nikon brand grips after going through two of them in two years.

"This is a gorgeous watch. The case and watch face are a beautiful rose gold tone and the crown is very decorative.  It's a fancy watch and would be great for any special occasion. It keeps the date as well as time.What I didn't love about it was the deployment clasp. It would be great if it came with directions of how to use it, but it does not. My husband and I found a video on you tube titled, 'Instructions on how to use your deployment clasp', but until we found it and watched it multiple times we could not figure out how to get it to work correctly.Once my husband got the deployment clasp set up to the correct size for his wrist, it works great - you want to set it up once and then leave it set. The purpose of this type of clasp is to preserve the leather strap, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.Other then the clasp issue, this is a beautiful watch and recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R40A58DPOACXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015K87GHG#wasThisHelpful","R40A58DPOACXL","A2MO8QZTNYYB98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MO8QZTNYYB98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is so much more than just a night light and is one of the coolest products I've ever had. My kids abosolutely love it! When using it you can choose a standard color, or you can keep it on the multi-color setting just like the picture a colorful ocean wave, which is cool...it seems as if the ocean is actually above you. It's something that I've used when getting my kids to sleep as it's very calming and relaxing, plus it gets their attention in a good way. I like that it can be operated with batteries as well as with the AC adapter too. The Abcotech Multicolor Ocean Wave Light Projector makes no noise when you are using it unless you use it as a speaker. You can plug in an iPod, iPhone or other device and play music through the projector. You really need to experience this to appreciate the full effect. It's very mood altering and calming and I can always appreciate something so relaxing in my household.

"I absolutely love essential oils and have incorporated them into my household uses over the past few months. There are so many neat and helpful things you can do with them and I love that it's a more natural solution to everyday problems and issues. I've used this Peppermint Oil for many things, but one really cool thing is that it deters spiders and mice. I live in a very rural area and having mice and spiders is pretty common although I hate it. I've added a bit to a spray bottle of water and sprayed around the house (doorways, windows, etc...) and also put a few drops on cotton balls and strategically placed them around the house. I've seen no mice or spiders since doing this. I also use it in my diffusers for a little pick me up and have recently used Peppermint Oil to help bring down my son's fever. I've recently used Peppermint Essential Oil for headaches. Whether a sinus headache, tension or migraine, I simply rub a but of oil on my temples, the bridge of my nose and other strategic places for relief. I love this oil! I could go on and on...This particular bottle is wonderful. It's a large size which is not common when buying essential oils and it's a good quality.

"This is one of the most useful items that I own. I've been slowly putting together an emergency kit in my home and when I received this survival fishing kit, I was so excited because it can do so much if needed! I hope that I'm never in need of some of these things, but if so, I can start a fire, make a fishing pole and use the paracord for various things. Whether camping or in a bad situation, I feel much better knowing that I have something to help keep my family and I going.

My daughter has an iPhone and an iPad Mini and unfortunately, the brand name cords that came with her devices didn't last long so paying those high prices for replacement accessories was not high on my list. Thank goodness for products like this one from Skiva. This cable and car charger are idea for what she needs and they are made very well, they've actually lasted longer so far than her name brand cables did, a huge bonus!

"This is an excellent set of skewers and a huge plus that it includes a rack for cooking on the grill. My family and I love to BBQ and kabobs are a favorite although cooking them with traditional skewers isn't always easy. With this set our food doesn't burn because it sits just high enough off of the grill to get the heat yet not burn and you can rotate the skewers without putting your fingers near the grill and risk burning yourself. The stainless steel skewers and rack are dishwasher safe, easy to clean and store. I like that the skewers have looks for hanging and I simply hand them and the rack from my pot rack in the kitchen. It's up out of the way until the next BBQ. I love this set!

"This arrived just in time for the rain and I can never have enough good umbrellas! I keep an umbrella in my car and by the door in my home and encourage my daughters to do the same, you never know and don't want to be caught without one. This one is great, it's pretty sturdy yet is small enough to fit into my purse when not in use. I love that it's compact and portable. My favorite feature is that it opens and closes with just one button. It makes it so easy to use especially when my hands are full! The material is good quality, doesn't let the rain or wind get to me while using it and holds up perfectly!

So much yumminess for people who cannot eat gluten, my friends are almost jealous with the adjustments I have made with my diet due to this book and my allergy. ;) I have been eating healthier dishes such as soups, broths, vegetarian lasagna, and more! There is so much gluten free foods people can eat according to this book-- breads and pastas! I never knew I would ever be eating breads and pastas again, so I am so happy to have ran into this life saver of a book.

I am 21 years old and have struggled with acne all my life, I was able to calm my acne down when I turned 20 but had never achieved a clear face always had 2 or 3 noticeable blemishes on my face. My dermatologist suggested a system like this, but she obviously recommend the Clarisonic because that's what she sells. I opted for a cheaper version. Yes, this unit feels ""cheaper"" than a Clarisonic but it's far less of the cost. The Bellapulse helped clear my face, and helped calm my redness in 2 weeks time! it is gentle, easy to use, and your face feels so clean and radiant!

"A solid convertible seat but I would go with the Graco Size4Me 65 Convertible Car Seat, Pierce instead.For a the same price range (when the Size4Me is on sale) it offers extra padding for infants and a much better base with a great recline feature for forward-facing toddlers.Worth noting that the Graco chest buckles (regardless of the model) are a bit of a pain to undo.One issue I encountered specific to the Contender is with the rear-facing latch clips.

"This quickly became our ""when friends with infants/toddlers are over"" high chair. It is no frills and gets the job done but is lacking in a few features I really like.Let's start with what I don't like:- No height adjustment. My little one likes to kick the table when the chair is too high. I prefer a height just below the surface of the table we eat at to prevent this.- The leg divider is part of the tray not the chair. This makes using it without the tray nearly impossible.- No rollers/casters on the feet. Moving around when in use is not easy.Things I like:- Super lightweight and folds up just like my Graco stroller.

"A great combination of products. I use the brush for all my bottles and keep supplemental formula in my bag using the included dispenser. A must have when on the go. Unfortunately, my little one did not take to this pacifier.As far as the bottles go, they are my (and my baby's) new favorite.Here is why:Nipple - The Natural nipple is wider than the classic nipple. For my baby, he has an easier time sucking with very little leaking unlike the classic nipple that does leak often. Additionally, the Natural nipple is more like my own nipple which helps lessen nipple confusion between the breast and bottle feeding.Cleaning - The Natural nipple has only three parts to clean including the nipple, the collar and the nipple cap. This is one less part than the classic which has the parts listed and an additional collar inside the bottle. This makes for one less part to clean which I like. Although it is only one part, when you are cleaning bottles everyday the time saved adds up.Baby Reaction - I mentioned there is less leaking with these bottles but I also notice that for our baby there is less burping and less hiccups when I use these bottles.  I cannot completely attribute this to the bottles because there are other factors that could be at play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6SL0OLL95C4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1CI2TO#wasThisHelpful","R6SL0OLL95C4Y","A282RNKOO2P5RT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A282RNKOO2P5RT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an exact fit for my son's 2000 CR-V.  Old part came out very easy and this part went in just as you would expect.  Existing hoses clamped right into place with no problems at all.  Functions as good as original.A couple items of note:1 - you will need to remove the feed elbow from your existing pump to install onto this unit.  Not a big deal - just 2 screws.2 - I ordered the pulley but I doubt I needed it.  It is a bit tougher to get the pulley retention bolt off of the old pump and on to the new one.

"Great product.  Awesome product.  This is so much better than a typical coffee grinder which uses whirling blades to pulverize coffee beans into submission.  This grinder is much more like a pepper mill to crush.grind beans to a consistent size.  You will get better tasting coffee and a more efficient use of beans.It could not be easier to use. 1- set to desired level of grinding by adjusting the small wheel/nut at the base of the grinder. 2- pour beans in the top. 3-place the collection cup on the bottom. 4- crank away, and away, and away....Seriously, this provides a superior grind and will improve the yield from the beans used, but at a cost.  It takes several minutes of grinding to produce enough coffee for a single pot.  It's all good, but do not be deceived - several minutes of grinding per pot.  Compare this to 15 seconds in a power grinder and I can tell you that this will quickly take a back seat in our house.  Am I lazy?  Maybe, but I just can't see cranking away for 3 minutes or more to get enough grounds for a single pot.UPDATE#1 -Question.  How many handle cranks does it take to process enough beans for 6 cups of coffee. In a drip coffee maker?Answer. 267Slight OCD are we?  Maybe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HGUJGZE91J1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE40XE0#wasThisHelpful","R3HGUJGZE91J1W","A306NASGVUDFKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A306NASGVUDFKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this is a good idea for a product, this has already found a spot in my tech-toy junk pile.Where to startâ€¦  the USB dongle is relatively large and the pen mounts to the magnetic base and sits up like a statue stuck to the side of your laptop, or tablet.  The very nature of a laptop & tablet is the portability aspect so you continually have to dock & undock the pen & dongle.  A better solution would be a docking stand that plugs into a USB port, but sits next to the laptop/tablet/phone.  At least then there would only be a cord that you would need to plug in and out and not have to deal with the dongle.The pen itself seems unbalanced and did not feel like a useful extension while writing on a touch screen. The stylus is permanently extended; there is no way to retract it during storage or carry.  To me this seems like a long term risk for damaging the tip accidentally.  A cover or retraction capability would be nice.  Also it should have a pocket clip.  Even a cheap or high end ballpoint would come with this so why not then pen?The apps worked well for me, but you need to buy them and this can increase the cost of this pen substantially.Bottom-line.  I received this as a free item from Amazon Vine to review.  For me, free is about the right price for this device.  It has to many drawbacks for me to say it is worth spending $75 for the device and then multiple dollars more for the apps.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O0RUAY4OTNJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBWT1P4#wasThisHelpful","R1O0RUAY4OTNJO","A306NASGVUDFKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A306NASGVUDFKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great product.We struggle with houseflies this time of year and we have tried many products.  Since we live outdoors in the summer, the biggest challenge is keeping them from getting into the house.  Next to that is keeping them away from our outdoor space; after all, who wants flies buzzing around your when you are trying to enjoy yourself.  Next up is finding something that does not replace flies with a total stench.Last year we tried another product and it worked great, but it smelled like a cat died in our back yard.  It was horrible!We switched to this product this year and it is spot on.  With all the rain we have had this year in Texas - the flies were at an all time high.  Last weekend I killed 35 in the house on one day alone.  This arrived on Monday and we have been fly free ever since.  Both inside & outside.  They are all trapped in the jar.

"I love the shredded memory foam pillows. And surprisingly the whole ""bamboo"" cover is also a nice touch.  I never would have equated bamboo with soft fabric, but here it is; so much nicer than cotton and it breathes too.This pillow is okay.  It is a heavy weight and will hold up to years of scrunching, no doubt.  But it does have some serious flaws.1 - smells bad.  They say ""new car smell"" and they could not be farther off the mark.  How about ""moldy shack smell"".  This is what this reeks of.  The other memory foam pillows also had this odor, but this particular one is several times worse.  40 minutes in the drier helped a bunch.2 - Does not state that it is machine washable.  It states ""surface clean only"", what ever that means.  The other memory foam pillows we have clearly state that you can throw it in the washer when ever you want.  Not sure why this one is different if it is made with the same basic materials.3 - Too lumpy.  It appears that this pillow it simply stuffed with chunks of memory foam and some of them are quite big.  This leaves this pillow with lots of lumps.  SOFT lumps to be sure, but lumps none the less.  Our other memory foam pillows seems to have two foam sheets on the top and bottom of the inner lining with foam chunks in the core.  Same idea, but there is a barrier between your head and the chunks.  Bottom line - no lumps.So while I like the pillow, there are better options.  I would recommend looking at - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L4AWEOK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1This is the ""Clara Clark Rayon made from Bamboo Shredded Memory Foam Pillow, Queen Size"" that I am using as a comparison.

"This is an awesome product,, but it is clearly not for everyone.  It is too cost prohibitive.  The product is very high protein, has few ingredients other than turkey, chicken and some quality vegetables, and it has a softer - even chewy texture to it.  It goes without saying that my dog loves it and I feel good feeding it to him.  Since we have already been providing him with an organic dry food for years, we are just adding this as a mix in for some added variety, taste enhancement and protein boost.But then there is the cost factor to contend with.  If you can afford it, this is a great product.  If you want to add some benefits to your existing feed, then this is worth considering.  But for me it is outside the boundaries of my budget.  My wife and I already eat healthy for our selves and buy organic that winds up on out plate. And we always make sure that we save a bit for Roscoe; so in a way he is already geting the bennefits of this product without having to buy it separate.So in the end - it is a mixed review.

"Don't get me wrong, I like these but they have their place in the grand scheme of things.  If you have an office, waiting room, small business / cafe or live in a small apartment or dormitory, then these are a great way to add a bit of flare without spending too much on decor.  Have blemish on the wall that you want to conceal quickly & easily?  These are great for that as well.  But these are not great works of art and they are very light weight solutions (good & bad there).The construction is such that you affix a small piece of Velcro to the wall.  You then line up the base of the fixture over the Velcro and use the built in level to make sure it is lined up correctly, then push into place.  The decorative plates that go on top are held in place with a magnet which makes changing things up a breeze.  It also makes it easier to clean; pop it off, clean it up and stick it back in place.To make mine a bit more appealing, I will take some of my favorite photos and have them printer on sticky backed paper and then mount them to the plate.Over all - pretty nice & easy way to dress things up quickly & inexpensively.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UGQIKBW67DWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9Q7MOM#wasThisHelpful","R1UGQIKBW67DWX","A306NASGVUDFKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A306NASGVUDFKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice blanket.  And unlike other reviewers, this IS black.  Not mocha, not dark brown; midnight black.Okay, so it is plush, it is warm, it is a decent weight for the amount of warmth it provides, and it is well made. So what could possibly be a downside?  Well for us it is dog hair.  This is a dog hair magnet and once it is on there it is almost impossible to get off.  This is a big deal for us. As clean as we keep the house, or single dog produces a lot of hair.  And it shows on this blanket.  Perhaps a different color would ""show"" it less, even though it would hold it just as much.So great blanket, if you don't have a dog or cat.

"This is a really nice phone, but don't try to do a direct compare with the top phones from Apple or Samsung.  This is exactly what it claims to be, a good phone with capable features, running on a steady Android platform and a ""no frills"" build.  Things like a battery that a user can not replace indicates that this really is meant to be bought, used and thrown away after a few years.  Which is okay - by the time the battery cycles down you will want a new phone and BLU will be there with another value priced model.Nice - runs Android so it will be familiar to anyone who has owned a previous smart phone, plus it will be easy to learn for a new user.Big, and I mean huge - screen!  Great for tired eyes and great for younger video hungry users.Downsides?  A few..  the touch screen is not as sensitive as others and this can get a bit annoying at times when you are trying to navigate your way around.  Also, the ""Back"" button is on the lower left of the phone as opposed to Samsung which is on the lower right.  Why does this matter?

"Keyboard, mouse & access USB attachment.I plugged in the device and Windows 7 -64 recognized it straight away.  In a very short time I was connected to the PC and connected to the keyboard & mouse.  The USB dongle is very small - great for a laptop where you want a full size keyboard & mouse because the dongle is very small and low profile.  It won't get hung up on anything, won't snap if it did and fits very snugly into the USB bay.  Very nice.The keyboard is a good, full size unit, with a full compliment of keys, which are crisp & responsive to the touch.  The rest for the palms is functional and comfortable.  I do a lot of data entry, so having a separate number pad is always a welcome touch (I understand that most have these, but I would seriously miss it if it were not there).  The key pad presents itself at a nice angle which is comfortable for long spells at the keyboard.On to the mouse - I don't like it much.  The folks at Logitech went for design and lost some functionality by making it look stylish.  I much prefer a more classic looking mouse and I also prefer one with a bit more weight to it.  The mouse in the set is small, light and oddly shaped - I don't care for it at all.The claim is that the battery life is greatly extended - I really hope so because I use my PC a lot and right now I have to change out cells about every 3-4 months.  They claim as long as 36 months for the keyboard but I will need to see this to believe it.  My cell phone say the battery will last up to 36 hours, sure... if you turn all features off and never make a call or look at the screen.  Once you start using the phone.. well I would be thrilled with 8 hours of regular day use.  I sure hope that 36 months is not assuming that it just sits there and is not touched.  We'll see.Overall - it is okay.  Not great, mostly due to the mouse, but I am grading this as a set, not individual pieces.  I am sure I will get the hang of the mouse in time, but a more classic style & weight would be better for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376GCOE0RE2J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXT5T3U#wasThisHelpful","R376GCOE0RE2J6","A306NASGVUDFKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A306NASGVUDFKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But the price seems a bit high to me for a product from this manufacturer.I do like the packaging better that the Frountline products - it is easier to open and apply.  I always struggle with the bullet proof packaging from Frountline and this was a welcome change.  It also has a slightly wider aperture in the dispensing applicator so the product flowed better that the competition.I am happy with the product, I just wish it was a bit lower priced.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JAUSS7K28VMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2CNXA#wasThisHelpful","R3JAUSS7K28VMB","A306NASGVUDFKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A306NASGVUDFKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy all the Odd Thomas books and this one is no exception.  I love the narrative tone to this series and this one dives deeply into the atmosphere of life in a monastery.  Dean uses rich language, full of color and shape to describe Odd's surroundings and he dealings with a wide array of varied characters.  I also really like the selection of narrator (audio edition) for the Odd Thomas series.  He really brings Odd to life and does a great job voicing the other characters as well.The ending is not as strong as I would have hoped for, but it is still an enjoyable listening experience none the less.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTISYD1ZNOOQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004V021M0#wasThisHelpful","RTISYD1ZNOOQ5","A306NASGVUDFKF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A306NASGVUDFKF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a love-hate relationship with most cases.  I love the way they protect an expensive item like a tablet or phone, but I hate the added bulk and weight.  This case for the Kindle Fire is a very nice balance of being protective enough for 99% of any unforeseen accident, yet it is very light weight and unobtrusive.  I can not think of a better set up or anything I would change about this case to make it any better.It is perfect for use around the house and while traveling; securing the Fire while not adding any burden of having the extra protection.Great product.

"I bought 3 of these units to cut down on the possibility of a power surge destroying my new Smart TV and equipment.  I read a lot of reviews on the various units before deciding to purchase this one.  The reviews I like to read are unfortunately by people that had a surge and the results they obtained from the surge protector they used.  Many complaints were from the fact that their equipment got destroyed since the protector failed its job.  Others complained at how their lesser-known brands had warranties but getting them honored was impossible.I've used APC equipment while installing and managing computer equipment for years.  APC is sometime pricy but I've never had an APC unit fail and as a result allow damage to connected equipment.  Many other surge suppressors promise the world but when a problem happens people have a hard time getting the manufacturer to honor their warranty.Not only does the warranty on this unit cover the replacement of the unit but it also covers up to $25,000 in attached equipment that gets damaged as a result of a surge that traveled through the unit.  Of course you will have to send them the surge unit that failed so they can confirm that a surge traveled through it.When I got the items in the mail I was a bit confused as there were three different papers in with the device that all seemed to give conflicting information.  One read that the warranty only replaced the surge protector, another read that the warranty was only for 2 years and that you could purchase additional coverage, yet the packaging the unit came in says it covers up to $25,000 in connected equipment that was surged as a result of failure of the unit.Being confused now I decided to do some research to track down someone at APC to get the correct information.When I contacted APC (manufacturer) they rep did not know about the 2 year, or only the protector being replaced, rather he told me that the model I purchased P1T had the $25,000 connected equipment coverage.  He even sent me an email stating this protection with a direct explanation of this coverage in detail and told me to keep the email for future reference as it indicated whom to contact etc for warranty coverage.Now I was happy since I had the straight facts from the manufacturer.  The other documents inside the package were attempt by advertisers to get my contact information which I did not need to bother to deal with at all.The only thing that I'm not liking is that there are 2 bright green led lights on the front of the unit which show up quite bright in a dark bedroom at night behind the wall mounted TV.  I'll need to put some black tape over them to cut down the light as I like a dark room when I sleep.  I have room darkening shades, thermal curtains, and mini-blinds to cut down light so for sure I do something to dull the light while still being able to tell it still working.You won't be sorry if you purchase this APC unit.  It does cost more than the cheaper units for little less known manufactures, but when you are protecting equipment that has value, you probably want something as reliable as this company.PROS:- Small size- Included phone surge protected splitter on bottom (line in to 2 line outs)(? do people still use landlines?)- 2 LED indication showing that the circuit is properly grounded and that you are protected (both should be on always)- Comes with $25,000 connected equipment lifetime warranty- UL listed and rated- Made by APC, well known company in electronics industry that been around forever, know for UPS devices and other surge units for commercial environments- APC stands behind their equipmentCONS:- Covers up both outlets on wall plug- 2 green LED lights are rather bright (if you prefer a dark room at night cover 90% with tape allowing you to still be able to tell it works)- Cost more than most but that's because it is well made and APC stands behind their equipment","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37DCO0L4NK5JV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DFZ2U#wasThisHelpful","R37DCO0L4NK5JV","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am using this is a cinder block room that has no insulation in it.  The room is about 25 x 25 with a drop ceiling.  This little heater does a nice job at supplementing another one in the room.  It is really small in size but the blower on it can be felt from about 3 feet away with a little breeze.  It is about 1/2 the size of a standard shoe box.  But for that little size it really packs a punch.One of the girls in the office commented on how nice it was and she wanted to get one for her bedroom at home since her heater has a hard time supplying the heat to the farthest room in the house.The heater has a fan only setting,  a low heat setting, and a high heat setting.  The fan will run based on the temperature that you set the unit at, even when set to fan only.  There appears to be no filter to clean on this unit so I'd make it a habit of periodically running the vacuum over it to remove any dust before it builds up.I liked the one I got for work so much that I decided to buy another one to store near the furnace in case our furnace fails.  This unit should be able to keep my insulated basement warm enough so I wouldn't need to worry about frozen pipes in the event of a furnace failure.Would also be the perfect size for a travel trailer camper.  My dad had one similar to this when I was a kid and it did a great job keeping the travel trailer toasty.PROS:- Metal Construction- Fits under desk drawer section of office desk easily (about as tall as a shoebox and about 1/2 the length of one too)- Two setting heat- The case does not get hot when running, only the front exhaust- Would be ideal to use in a travel trailer to save on propane- Can run as Fan only, Low Heat, HIgh Heat- Temperature setting know on side allows for cycling on/off of unit and fan- Dropped from 4 feet up onto concrete floor with no sign of damage or ill effect on operation (try that with plastic)CONS:- Wished unit was bigger in size to have a stronger blower to push air greater distance- Air breeze felt only up to 3 feet from unit- No filter to remove and clean; need to remember to vacuum unit periodically so it doesn't plug up with dustIf you buy it, knowing it's size and limitations I'm sure you'll be impressed by this little heater too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8M0IJDA0CHXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1SNMYG#wasThisHelpful","R8M0IJDA0CHXW","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I also wish that the picture wasn't cropped as much on the top of his head.I don't understand why these prints of the painting have to be so costly.  After watching the movie and listening to the painter's story I would have thought that she'd want everyone to be able to share in the gift that she obtained.  Instead it appears as though the reprinting of these pictures from the original painting is to get as much money as possible rather than make it possible for everyone to have a nice Christian picture in their home.

"We mounted an automatic air freshener in our basement laundry room because our cat's litter box is stored down there too.  I think our little kitty has a bad habit of not covering up and using the automatic air freshener set to 30 minute sprays with these Linen Fresh scent allows us to keep our sanity.I tried other scents in the past and I'm not a big fragrance person.  Meaning I not into smelling flowers in the basement.  I just wanted a neutral smell without some obnoxious smell.  Linen Fresh scent fits the bill.  It smell like clean laundry without all of the perfume smell.This can is the exact replacement size to replace the Technical Concepts (TC) brand of 6 oz Linen Fresh 3000 metered sprays that has become ever so hard to find a replacement for.  TC's stock number was 400983 and UPC was 763905009836 if you too are looking for an replacement with the same size measures for the spray can to keep your sprayer operational.We kept the cat so yes, it truly does the job, and I now have a source for replacements again.This is the most important measurement: From bottom of can to top of sprayer is 5 and 3/8 inches.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J1JGOWILOF2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B4I5JXU#wasThisHelpful","R3J1JGOWILOF2I","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I looked around for a quality switch to replace the one that was on my generator.I needed a simple on/off toggle switch and this one fit the bill.  Comes with a lower nut that fits a wrench and another top nut that is round which can be gripped with pliers.  I put the lower nut at the depth needed for the cover I installed the switch in and then tightened the top nut down to the cover plate which held the switch snugly in place.  Since I mounted it on a vibrating generator I needed to make sure the connection could hold up to vibration so I was easily able to solder the connections so the screws could not come loose.This is a high quality switch with a solid toggle action.

"After reading comments made by others I knew that each of these tiles was thin, about 1/8"", so I would need to double up the thickness to use normal push pins. This is why I ordered 2 packs.Upon receiving the packs I glued two tiles together to double the thickness.  I glued the panels together around the edges only in the event that the hardness of the dried glue would prevent a push pin from going through. Don't bother using the tape that comes with them. It won't stick to the tiles.Now I took my double thick tiles and used hot glue to attack them to the wall.  The hot glue goes into the pores of the tiles and even adheres well to a cinderblock wall (typically found at college). Now I have a bulletin board on the wall that takes the pushpins and since I used hot glue if I want to take it down it will come down without damaging the wall. The tiles however will probably not be reuseable as they will probably tear on removal but the wall will be damage free.  I use hot glue all the time at work to put up posters and stuff on cinderblock walls.

But, if the new visitor (cat) stays for a longer time period the scent doesn't seem to do the trick any more. We had 3 of these running in different parts of the home as our 2 cats didn't like the idea of us allowing my deceased parent's cat come into our home to stay.When our cats had their space invaded at first they were tolerant, and I think the scents helped, but eventually they saw the visitor not leaving so they ganged up on the older visitor to show dominance. Continued exposure over time and supervised contact seems to be the overall key one the locals learn that they are not being replaced by the newcomer.Did it help? We think so, but don't think that it is the fix that will solve all problems.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2067INQG1J284/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HFNE4I#wasThisHelpful","R2067INQG1J284","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the fact that it is a good app for having phone lists for the local stake and wards. Also contains all scriptures and classroom manuals for student and instructor. Magazine subscriptions can also be a thing of the past as they are available here for kids, teens, and adults for free too.Program requires you to have a LDS.org sign-in to verify that you should have access to information.  Based on this information you are given access to information where you are listed as residing.  The program updates often and verification of your log-in credentials is often made often.Overall a great free app that anyone attending an LDS church should have access too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L72TI0K1Z3CM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JMD1NU#wasThisHelpful","R1L72TI0K1Z3CM","A3B3HBKN6PR2N7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B3HBKN6PR2N7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
