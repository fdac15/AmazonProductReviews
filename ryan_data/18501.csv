"This is a promising pilot for a TV series. It has an early twist, so don't read any of the summaries if you don't want to be spoiled (it's not a big spoiler in the grand scheme of the show, but it's a nice twist). The actors are all delivering down to earth performances, making the story more believable and feel more real - which is a big plus because one of the premises requires a little bit of a suspension of disbelief for dramatic reasons. Of the characers so far, the grandma stood out the most for me. It will be interesting to see how they would do a full season and future seasons while keeping the story fresh and non-formulaic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R616WJYM916AN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01348CEDU#wasThisHelpful","R616WJYM916AN","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dove soaps in general are smoother than say something like Irish Spring. More so with this bar, with the extra moisturizers. The bar is solid in the hand, with a good grip, and maintains rigidity. It has a distinctive non-subtle smell, but it is neither obnoxious nor objectionable, nor one of those marketing-inspired ""man smells"" (think Axe and such). I think many ladies would probably like it too.It lasts about as long as other 4oz to 5oz bar soaps that I previously used, so perhaps a mild advantage when comparing to 5oz bars, but then again, most people buy soap by the number of bars or the package, not by weight.As advertised, it is nice and gentle on the face (avoid contact with eyes), I couldn't really notice a difference between it and a basic facewash. The issue with face washing is on subsequent baths. How many people would feel comfortable using the bar on their face after it went through a full body wash? Sure, one could use one side for the face, and the other for the body. Still, many will still say ""no"", so another possibility is to use two bars. One designated for the face, and one designated for the body. At some point, you can always transition the Face to the Body (so it doesn't linger around for too long) and open a fresh bar for the face. But this adds more bathing complications or perhaps not enough space for multiple bars of soap.There is a long list of ingredients printed on the outer wrapper but not on the individual soap boxes. There's the usual avoid contact with eyes warning.Prices and promotions go up and down, so I can't compare those. Personally I am not picky on soaps, so if I was out of soap and had to buy an 8 pack, I would probably buy this if it was within 1.5x or less of the price of the typical brands (Irish Spring, etc). Maybe up to 2x if I was in a pampering mood :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SGR9B0V7BI2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS81M58#wasThisHelpful","R2SGR9B0V7BI2I","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a non-refillable spiral notebook with a covered spiral, and you are willing to pay for the extra features, then you may find this quite useful. It has 150 college ruled perforated pages, three removable and repositionable dividers with two pockets each, and a penloop on the front. You cannot open this, so you cannot add more pages once you fill it up.One of the reasons this notebook is effective is because its spiral has about twice the radius (rough estimate) of a typical basic wired notebook, making it easier to flip through without intrapage snagging and resistance. The outer spiral is covered when the notebook is closed or when it lays flat on the desk. But if you fold the notebook under itself, the spiral is not covered. If you remove the pen from the penloop, it is pretty nice to write with when it is folded under itself. It takes up less space on the desk and brings out the page in front of you.The dividers are easy to add/remove, they hold on to the wire spine in five different places. They are in a 2-1-2 formation, so there is some leeway in case a couple of the connection points break (mine are working fine, but they are fairly thin). You can also reuse the dividers in other notebooks (as long as the pieces fit).One thing that is not included but may be useful is if you use a thin cardboard or some other glossy flyer or something else to put underneath the page you are currently writing on. This serves two purposes: 1) it won't scratch the page below,  or 2) when the page is near a divider, the shape and texture of the divider and its pocket interfere a bit with the writing (not a flat smooth surface).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24VJ06661ZHOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7X2K9Q#wasThisHelpful","R24VJ06661ZHOD","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book I read from the author and I haven't watched the movie adaptation of her book either. I liked the idea of reading a creativity inspirational book (I rarely read inspirational books), but I did not know what to expect. I was worried it might turn out to be a variation of SNL's Daily Affirmations. Thankfully, it was totally not like that at all!For a book that talks about ""magic"", it offers a lot of very grounded inspiration for artists of all kinds. The style is conversational, flowing, rolling, and jumping, an outpouring of the author's creative (and life) experiences. If you are the type who prefers heavily structured and organized books, perhaps consider reading this book as a creativity fostering assignment :) It consists of seven parts, with each part having multiple segments of varying length (from one to a few pages each). As such, it makes it ideal for reading in small bites, 10-20 pages per seating. It gives you time to think and absorb.Grounded inspiration as in (I'm paraphrasing/summarizing): you are not the center of the universe, but you are part of the universe, you belong here as much as anyone else. You are not entitled to anything or everything you want, but you are entitled to your creative life no matter what others are saying. You are not The Chosen One, but you have a lot inside you can unlock and cultivate and share with the world if you are willing to put in the work... I am not really doing the book justice here, there are hundreds of different ways this is expressed (and a lot more eloquently) in the book.But it goes far beyond that. It tackles some tougher issues with creativity, perfection vs good enough, creative compromises vs artistic purity, stubborness, ego's power, on giving up, dealing with reactions from others, our (creativity's) emotional cycles, measuring success, expectations and outcomes, creative careers and money matters and day jobs, authenticity vs originality, meaning and purpose, the suffering and tormented artists, dealing with disappointments, ""between those bright moments"", creative work is not a baby, and so forth.Although this is not a how-to or step-by-step book, there are a handful of direct and indirect tips, some very specific (for example, if you are stuck, do something different (eg if a writer, play music or work the yard or paint bicycles)), some more general. Among others, tips and ideas include Dress Up, fostering curiosity and inquisitiveness, having an affair (with your creativity), and on and on.As with arts and humans, there is a paradox in the book. Coming along for the ride with all the grounded inspiration is magic. In the gray area of just beyond metaphors and figures of speech, the author posits that ideas are self-aware entities (""disembodied, energetic life-form""), and cites examples of such, the most prominent being the Brazil Amazon book idea that ""jumped"" from one author to another at a specific point in time. The more I read, the more it felt like the author actually believed this: my last note in the Enchantment chapter was a puzzled ""really believes it?""A number of authors, artists and works of art are mentioned within the book, along with stories (lots of stories) from their creative lives. Not just famous people, but also everyday life people, from Red Lobster to Winifred to Brene Brown to Tom Waits and many more). These may also be of interest if you are looking for things to read or discover or rediscover next (which could be as simple as reading the Wikipedia of the creative persons mentioned or as complicated going through their work).My favorite quote from the book: ""I believe that our creativity grows like sidewalk weeds out of the cracks between our pathologies - not from the pathologies themselves"".It is all text (no diagrams/tables/charts), so you won't miss anything if you read this on an e-book reader. Maybe a good idea to get both because this is a book you can read multiple times and share with friends and family.I found this book interesting enough that I have already began re-reading it out of my own free will - a measurable data point of the value and importance of a book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VTYXMGSLEYS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634718#wasThisHelpful","R1VTYXMGSLEYS3","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading the Comments exists in the nebulous space between a pop-science book and a textbook. It is more readable than a research book but not as sing-alongy as a pop-science book. It takes a wide look at the ways people comment on the internets. You soon realize this is a lot more complicated subject than it may initially feel (""it's just online comments by random people"") and books could probably be written dedicated to each form and type of commentary (eg Twitter, Blogs, Forums (okay, may be a trilogy for forums), etc).The writing style is straight-forward, the book is broken into seven interlinked chapters (plus a conclusions chapter) diving high and low into the various forms of commentary and their intersection points beyond the comment box. There's a variety of examples and anecdotes, including the ""Saved our Son's Life - 4/5 Stars"", the rejection bump of research papers, Reznor's ""fragile"" moment, ""sleepwalkers"", Godwin's Law and lots more.At the back of the book there are 34 pages of references (books, research, many websites and web articles), broken down by chapter. A pretty comprehensive list of reading materials, which would be of great value to anyone seriously interested in this topic. I looked at the publisher's website and within the book, but I did not find these available online (which can be handy for the web links). TIP: you don't have to type the full url, just search for the article name and website/author - the search engines are pretty good at finding them.The book content is more than the actual number of 187 pages of main text (228 total) would suggest because of a smaller font and economical line-spacing which translates to 37 lines of text on a 9x6 inch printed page. If you find the text too small, the e-book should be of help since you can zoom and zoom and zoom: the book is text only with occasional black and white internet comics (for which you can also use a tablet/computer/phone).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31FVNENRSLBDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=026202893X#wasThisHelpful","R31FVNENRSLBDN","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I emptied one of these packs into a spoon, the first thing that came to mind was mayo. It turns out I was half-right, the third ingredient in a long list is pasteurized egg yolk. The approach here is to throw all kinds of different things to cover up the fishy taste (fish oil is the first ingredient, water being the second). Among the recognizable tastes, the strong orange flavor (4th item in list, ""natural orange flavor""), the mayo-egginess, 10mg Stevia Leaf Extract (with its characteristic after taste), and menthol that kicks the afterburners attempting to cover it all up.Now if this was a dessert, I would not like the taste. But its purpose is to cover up the fishiness, and at that, it is very successful. I prefer these to the gummies which have all kinds of nasty sugars (even high fructose corn syrup). Not that this one is perfect but at least it has no artificial sweeteners, no artificial flavors, no sugars, no gluten/wheat/yeast, no milk/lactose. But it still has about a dozen other things to hold it all together (less than 2%).It is on the expensive side, one box has 30 squeeze packs, with the serving size per the box being two squeeze packs. In other words, if you want to take this as such, one box lasts 15 days. Definitely more expensive than the horse pills. The squeeze packs are inside in 15 pairs. Each pair is perforated. Could be handy if you put it in lunch boxes and such for the whole day. These become less expensive if you prefer a lower dosage, for example one squeeze-pack per day or every other day instead.The instructions say take preferably with food and could be added to cold food (such as yogurt or smoothie), but do not freeze or heat the packs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK2T25SOQTK1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCOI1AI#wasThisHelpful","RK2T25SOQTK1L","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second Capital Teas loose-leaf tea that I tried, so I don't know if it is a house signature or just coincidence, but both were on the subtle and mild flavor side compared to other similar teas. Two reasons to consider this tea: 1) you prefer organic and are willing to pay a higher price, 2) you prefer a milder breakfast blend flavor. This is a blend of five teas, and it is not as Assam dominated as other breakfast blends. Their website describes the five teas used. It is marked as high caffeine, I did not notice a difference in caffeine impact compared to other breakfast blends.There are tea pieces of all sizes in this one, a lot of them are small. After infusion, I compared tea leaf sizes to a Tattle Tea loose leaf breakfast blend and I also cracked open a Trader Joe Breakfast blend tea bag. The smallest pieces of the Capital Tea were almost the same size as the Trader Joe tea bag (48 tea bags for $2, not organic). The Tattle tea did not have many small pieces as Capital, but it is not organic. I put the infused tea in separate water bowls, the size differences are much more obvious there than looking at them on a plate or bowl.Because it has more small pieces, you may want to use your smallest cell infuser or a tea sock, as there's more than usual at the bottom of the cup.The milder taste became obvious as I was switching back and forth between this and the Tattle tea and in a separate experiment, the Trader Joe breakfast blend. So it goes both ways, if you want a classic Assam-y breakfast blend, this is probably not it. On the other hand, if you want a milder breakfast blend but still get the morning tea-kick, and value organic, you may like it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCDNPS0GA2C5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK34DJG#wasThisHelpful","R2SCDNPS0GA2C5","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was on the unsweetened coconut milk and coconut water bandwagon but I never got around to trying coconut oil until this one. And it exceeded my expectations. I haven't tried any other brands yet, so I can't compare it. I love how just 1-2 teaspoons of this can make a boring salad more edible. It doesn't really have its own taste signature, but it helps bring out the flavor of the various crunchy greens in the salad (for lack of a better way to describe it). I prefer it to olive oil or prepackaged salad dressings (which have sodium and other ""bonus"" ingredients).I also take 1-2 teaspoons of this as a snack as needed, curbing what would have otherwise been a much worse (nutrition wise) snack. When eating on its own, it has a bit of a soothing effect, no after taste, but more than 2 teaspoons at once, I get the ""I ate too much oil"" type of a feel.It smells coconuty when you open the plastic jar, and still does a few weeks later. There is a bit of oiliness in the area around the rim but I don't know if it's the way that I'm using it (I turned it sideways, upside down, etc like a curious monkey when I first got it) or not a perfect seal.The container says this is cold pressed, 100% raw, 100% organic, extra virgin. There is only one ingredient, ""organic extra virgin coconut oil"". Per the container, refrigeration is not required, and so I obliged and did not refrigerate it, and I kept it away from the sun. I put it in an empty nutrition bar 12pk container for protection and to test for oily leaks. At room temperature, it is mostly solid with a bit of liquid pooling.Per the box, the 18oz jar has 36 tablespoon (14g) servings. Each serving is 120 calories, all from fat: 14g total (12g saturated, 1g mono). Zeros on the other categories: Carbs, Protein, Sodium, Cholesterol, Vitamins/Minerals.Sideways next to the barcode, It says ""product of the Philippines, packaged in the USA"". It has a BPA-Free logo with a recyclable sign next to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SD1TR6BV44G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9IMNKA#wasThisHelpful","R1SD1TR6BV44G3","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a versatile and customizable system, but the combination of one's hearing and the equipment they use (TV, cable box, etc) make things slightly different for every person, and for something like this, perhaps the best way to find out if it works for you is to try it. There's no one size fits all answer.WHAT'S INCLUDED================The package is very easy to open with your fingers. An outer sleeve covers the white cardboard re-closable container that has all the items. You push the container up or down to free it from the sleeve. Then open it gently.The front half of the box has the earphones in a storage box and the portable receiver (handset) with protective tape. Underneath these, you have the AC USB adapter charging head, and a solid box with three eartip sizes, and a standard RCA audio cable (red/white).The back half of the box has the two user manuals sealed (Quick Start Guide and User Manual). The serial number is printed on the back of the manual. Underneath these, and protected by padding you find the charging base (transmitter), the USB charging cable (microUSB to full USB), and the neckstrap in its own bag with silica gel.FIRST TIME USE=============Both the User Manual and the Quick Start Guide (essentially a Visual User Manual) are very well done and make sense and are helpful in figuring things out. The font is small at some places,The manual recommends charging for at least 5 hours the first time you use it. Mine finished charging in less than 4.5 hours but I let it go on for 5+ hours - obeying the manual.The receiver does not lock in place when you put it on the charging base to charge it. If you move the base, it will sway, so it is a good idea to put it at a place where it is not going to be accidentally knocked over.You can unplug and replug the base from the power supply without needing to take any installation steps, which makes it a good idea if you use it in different rooms or at different locations. Just package it and plug and play.BASE (the Transmitter)==================This only works when it is plugged in to the wall using the provided AC adapter using the microUSB to USB cable. It has a big ON/OFF button upfront. Press and hold to turn ON/OFF. While ON, there is a red light surrounding the button that stays until you power it off. The base charges the receiver (handset). The back has the connection, power, and three audio input options. The most common is RCA (white and red) and this cable is included. It also has an Optical input and a Digital Coaxial (Orange) input. Cables are not included for these. There is a button that switches between Optical and Digital Coaxial. For Digital Coaxial audio (the orange input), if you don't have a  proper orange coaxial cable, per various A/V forums, you can use a standard yellow RCA video cable (sounds strange to use a video cable for audio, but the specs/physics of the yellow video cable make it a better bet than the red/white audio cables) .IMPORTANT for DIGITAL AUDIO: digital audio only flows if your TV or BluRay player or other source outputs audio in 44.1kHz PCM / 48kHz PCM. Many modern devices default to the fanciest audio output available (surround sound, etc). You may have to manually change your audio settings to standard stereo. Otherwise you won't get audio from the digital inputs/outputs. Once I adjusted the audio settings, both Coaxial (DVD player) and Optical (TV) worked fine.If you want to listen to sound from a 3.5mm source (TV headphone out, Conventional Radio, Tablet/Phone, etc), you can just use a standard 3.5mm to RCA cable (you can get them for under $5, search for 1/8"" to RCA and make sure the male/female options are what you need). Mine worked fine with a couple of no-name generic cables of this type.Even in the summer, after running for 4+ hours straight, the base was just warm to the touch, not hot. I did not put it in a cabinet.SOURCE=======A very important factor to how well this may or may not work for you is the combination of your equipment and how you use them. For example, in some TVs (mine included) the convenient headphone out is an afterthought in terms of sound quality, so you can get better sound by connecting this to the Optical (TOSlink).A word on caution: different devices have different default volume, so start with a low volume and go up (for example, my DVD player is much louder than anything else I have). Put the earphones on only after everything is connected and the sound is playing. If it's too loud, you will hear it before you put them on your ears, so you won't risk further hearing issues.RECEIVER (HANDSET)===================It has a built-in non-removable rechargeable battery, charges on the Base unit. It is approximately 10 x 6 x 1.5 cm and weighs 3 ounces. It is slightly smaller than an iPod Touch 4 but decidedly thicker. A neckstrap is included, but you can also put it in your pocket like a smartphone or use exercise armbands for smartphones/iPods if you prefer that approach (check the dimensions).While operating, a small green light stays on and steady. If there are signal issues, it flashes. It has a power button and microUSB charging input on top.On the right side there's the yellow amplified sound switch (the user manual recommends not to use this ""except under some circumstances"" but does not elaborate) - probably because it makes things even louder while reducing sound quality. Below that, there's a standard volume rocker (up and down). There is a light next to the button that indicates volume. There is no mute option (workaround: unplug earphones or turn it off).On the left side there is one button, the Equalizer Presets. Each press switches to the next Preset. Unfortunately there is an annoying beep with each switch, which can get annoying real fast if you are going through the four options to see which one sounds better. There is no custom equalizer. Only four options. Option #1 is high frequencies, #2 is medium frequency, #3 is low frequency, and #4 is balanced (""overall optimized). This is where this may not be work for people with hearing difficulties that are not covered by the four presets. You cannot adjust the presets to better match the situation. You can change volume and turn on the Boost, but that's it.EARPHONES==========A set of earphones are included, in their own nice solid storage box. They have one pair of eartips installed and three extra pairs with different sizes. They are double flanged, so they can get a bit deeper in the ear and block a bit more noise. The blue is for Left and red for Right. There is also a very faint L and R on each side, but it's a lot easier to just remember bLue (left) or Red (R for Right).If you don't feel comfortable with this style, fear not. Since the Receiver (Handset) has a standard 3.5mm output, you can use just about any pair of headphones or earphones or even portable speakers or anything else that plays 3.5mm audio. You can try to pick headphones that are better match of your hearing and listening situation.MULTIPLE UNITS=============This is based on the user manual (I only have one base and one handset that is included in the box), but because it is a bit unusual, I thought I would mention it; you can buy additional receivers (handsets) so multiple people can listen to the same sound using one base unit (transmitter). However you must make sure they are the same color as your current Vitasound base because compatibility between base and receiver is based on their actual. For example, blue connects with blue, black with black, etc.If you want to use two base units of the same color, you have to make sure there is some distance between them. (if they are within 16 feet of each other, there will be interference). In such a case, you need to buy products of different colors or increase the distance between them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24HWR84476T77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNT50VM#wasThisHelpful","R24HWR84476T77","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good idea, and the product is organized very nicely, however, very little information is available on the product and compatibility, and I could not find any website or contact info for the manufacturer, so this makes it probably not a good idea for first-time buyers of 3rd party power adapters. If this was a random computer accessory (eg mouse or keyboard), not as big of an issue, but a power adapter can cause serious damage to a laptop, so a higher level of scrutiny is a good idea. On the other hand, if you are a veteran of power supplies, you may not need any of that, and you may be happy with this.Of four laptops ranging from 10 to 13 inch displays (Acer, ASUS, Dell, Samsung Chromebook), only one of them had matching power output to this Powerocker, a 13-inch Dell inspiron consumer laptop. The numbers were very close, not an exact match (probably within rounding error), but close enough for me to feel comfortable using it. It powered and charged the laptop without issue, even during some heavy duty action sessions, a massive Windows Update, and a Windows 8 to 8.1 update. The brick was hot during this, but still comfortable to the touch.For the other three laptops, the power requirements were quite different, and I was not wiling to risk frying good working laptops on a product that does not have a tangible manufacturer.For laptops with big power bricks, this provides a double advantage, a smaller power adapter when you are on the go or space is at a premium, and a backup in case you lose or break your original adapter. But some of the smaller laptops have power bricks that are about the same size; in this case, the advantage is having an extra/backup power adapter.WEIGHT: this power adapter weighs 5.1 oz with the power cable on the scale. The power cable is not removable. When I weighed just the brick with the cable off the scale, it was around 4.1 oz on its own.UNBOXING: The best thing about this product is the packaging, which reminds that of a smartphone. A small compact cardboard box, measuring 5.25 by 3 by 2 inches approximate. Inside a reclosable cardboardy container you find the charger wrapped in protective tape and the nine charging heads. One is pre-installed, while the other eight have a storage bay where they clip on securely.  At the very bottom of the box, there's a drawstring pouch sealed in its own see-thru bag, and a 2.75-inch square folded paper that has the basic power specs and instructions on how to attach heads. Unfortunately there is no information on how to figure out whether your laptop is compatible with it power-wise, which is the most important thing. Also no information on the manufacturer. The charging heads fit comfortably in the pouch, but you may have to be a master at cable folding to get the charger and the cable and the charging heads all fit in the pouch. Still a pouch is better than no pouch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OIG09GNERPBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHKV6OM#wasThisHelpful","R2OIG09GNERPBG","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had ZICO Natural coconut water in my fridge (the 11.2 fl oz tetrapak), so it was a good opportunity to compare it to the 16.9oz CocoZia Original unflavored coconut water. The biggest difference is that the Zico is noticeably sweeter, and the difference is more pronounced when you switch back and forth drinking from these. Another taste difference, after I returned home from a walk in the sun, I found the Cocozia to be more refreshing than the Zico. The Cocozia has a bit more of a ""salty taste"" (a poor way of me describing the unique coconut water taste), probably because it does not have the overpowering sweetness of ZICO.The mouth of the container is wider with the Zico than the Cocozia. The lids are not interchangeable even though they have similar shape and technology.In terms of ingredients, the Cocozia is 100% organic coconut water, while the Zico is coconut water. TIP: the Zico coconut water in the bottles is usually from concentrate, while the Zico in the tetrapaks (boxy containers with ears/flaps) is not from concentrate.Nutrition wise, there are a lot of similarities, but Cocozia has more iron (none in Zico), magnesium, calcium and phosphorus. Even though Zico tastes sweeter, Cocozia actually has slightly more sugar per serving. The rest of the numbers are pretty close (calories, total carbs, sodium). No fat, no protein.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NTSEVQAR3OAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW29KQQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NTSEVQAR3OAM","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Curel Daily Moisture Original Lotion (13 Ounce) comes in a mostly white container with a grey pump. The pump is easy to operate, and you can also use it one-handed (push with thumb while the rest of your palm collects the lotion). The pump feels sturdy and non-flimsy. The pump mechanism is removable and repositionable, just twist left or right and adjust position of pump head. A very gentle touch on the pump can get you as little as a raindrop (or lemon seed or something of that small amount).The container has a bit of ""widescreen"" shape, it doesn't have a big round bottom, so it maybe prone to tipping off if one hits it on the upper parts (might be of interest depending on where you plan to put it).The lotion is not fragrance-free, but to my nose, it is a mild and unobtrusive ""lotiony"" (for lack of a more professional term) smell. The lotion gets absorbed nicely. I can feel the moisturizer working. I haven't noticed any side effects or issues while using it.The whole long list of ingredients (17 or so) is on the back of the container. The directions are simple ""use daily and reapply to dry areas as needed. For external use only"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMSCEHCUQAJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NKFU98#wasThisHelpful","R3BMSCEHCUQAJX","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hefty Storage Slider Quart bags come in a 100% recycled paper container which is rather thin and it can give if you press it. Inside you find the bags stored in an easy to pull out fashion. Each bag is around 8x7 inches and weighs 0.2 lbs empty  (measured with a postal scale that goes up in 0.1oz increments).The back side of each bag is clear. The front has a big Hefty logo but also an area with a white background in the middle where you can write on. The writing area is roughly 5.75 by 0.75 inches, shaped more ribbon than rectangle. The front also has Open and Close signs (aligned with the slider head), so you don't have to memorize which side is which. If you don't need to write you may find all the ""decorations"" annoying. I use a Sharpie to write on it if I'm storing non-food items.Opening and closing makes a distinct sound as the slider-head clicks on each side. The slider mechanism feels pretty sturdy, so it should survive multiple openings and closings other things equal.The box has instructions on microwave use for quick reheating or defrosting but warns against overheating and melting. Personally I prefer to heat food in microwave safe plates and containers, even if it's an extra step.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RND7FNHWDOHBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E0FZQ0#wasThisHelpful","RND7FNHWDOHBA","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are handy if you need ready to go cereal packs. Obviously you can save more by buying regular size cereal boxes, so one needs to value the convenience and portability to justify purchasing these. The flavored ones are satisfying to eat as is. Some may find some of the plainer ones (such as Rice Crispies, Frosted Flakes) too boring to eat on their own. But there is enough room in the cup to drop a few blueberries (preferably smaller ones) and makes a difference in taste (the cups are too small for blackberries or strawberries).I like these with unsweetened and unflavored coconut milk. Since the cereal is loaded with carbs and most of them have a flavor of their own, I find coconut milk to be a great match for them.. TIP: when shopping for coconut milk, do read the labels. Some of the ""original"" national brand coconut milks are not unsweetened or not unflavored (flavor typically means sugar added in some form).The 24 pack of Special K cereal contains eight the following: Original (top floor of the box), Red Berries (middle of the box), and Fruit & Yogurt (bottom of the box).The 24 pack of Classic cereal contains uneven numbers: 7 Mini Wheats, 7 Frosted Flakes, 5 Raisin Bran Crunch, 5 Rice Crispies.Calories range from 140 (Special K Original or Rice Crispies) to 280 (Raisin bran) on their own (without milk). One cup is one serving. There is enough room in the cereal cup for up to 8oz of milk/liquid. My favorite of this lot in terms of taste is the Special K Red Berries that comes with slices of freeze-dried strawberries. This along with Fruit & Yogurt (has small pieces of strawberries) result in a reddish milk when you mix it in. Overall, the Special K pack is my favorite over the Classic by a significant margin.Protein wise, they range from 2 grams (Rice Crispies) to 7 grams (Special K or Mini Wheats). Likewise, fiber ranges from 0g to 8g (Mini Wheats). None of the seven has Trans, Saturated or Cholesterol. They have Sodium ranging from 8% to 18% (K Red Berries). The only exception are the Mini Wheats with 0% sodium. They also have a variety of Vitamins and Minerals.The list of ingredients is surprisingly short for five of them (1 to 1.5 lines). The exception are the Raisin Bran Crunch (3 lines) and the Fruit & Yogurt gone wild (five lines of ingredients).At the outside bottom of the cups, barely visible without scrutiny, there is a recycle 5 sign.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KWA8AFQ18P9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PHYE7OY#wasThisHelpful","R2KWA8AFQ18P9E","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are benefits to this popcorn, it is smaller, tastes more natural than mass-market popcorn, not as salty or slimy, and doesn't get stuck as much or as deep in the teeth (the ""virtually hulless"" claim). However, it comes at a premium. As of review time, it's about $2 per popcorn bag, which is a lot more than mass market (grocery stores, warehouse clubs, etc) popcorn. I am an occasional popcorn eater, and I could see this as a special treat or reward on rare occasions, but definitely too expensive for regular consumption.On a 700W microwave (I think it's 700W), I used the popcorn setting, and stopped it ten seconds before the timer stopped, about two minutes total. Only a dozen or less were unpopped at this setting. I preferred this than when I let it go all the way.Ingredients per the box: popcorn, organic expeller pressed palm oil, salt, natural butter flavor (organic sunflower oil).The popcorn bags stress ""no added diacetyl, no added colors, no artificial flavors"". The package has the verified non-GMO logo and certified gluten-free logo. The allergen statement says: ""may contain trace amounts of peanuts and tree nuts"".One package has three sealed 2.5oz bags. Each 2.5oz bag is 2.5 servings per the nutritional label. One serving has 150 calories with 10g fat (4.5g saturated, 0mg trans), 0mg cholesterol, 300mg sodium (13%), 13g carbs (3g fiber, 0g sugars), 2g protein and 2% iron. Many people will probably finish a popped bag when it's hot, so multiply that by 2.5. The nutritional text on the box is in small print.

"This is an alternative approach to the general use stylus for use with touchscreen devices. Instead of the usual cone-shaped head, this one has a ball-point rotating disc-shaped head. I found it to be slightly more accurate than generic styluses in some situations. This is a stand-alone device, you use it just like your finger - no software, no battery, no bluetooth, no buttons.However, this is not a replacement for a touchscreen with a digitizer and its dedicated pen. The Samsung S-Pen for the various Galaxy Note devices or the Microsoft Surface Pen are much much more effective at handwriting or anything else that requires more fine-tuned writing or pointing or drawing.It has a screw-on cap that protects the head when not in use. The cap also screws on the other end of the device (while in use), so you won't lose it. It has a built-in clip, which I guess has the added benefit of not using as much material :) I am not fond of clips in general.In use, the stylus is around 9.6cm without the cap attached, and around 11.2cm with the cap attached at the other end. With the cap attached over the pointing (""writing"") head for storage, it is around 9.6cm long. In other words, the cap completely covers the pointing head, so it is safe to put in bags and briefcases without any additional protection. The added benefit of the screw-on cap is that you essentially have two sizes, 9.6cm or 11.2cm (assuming you won't lose the cap if it is not screwed on all the time).Unboxing: it comes in a nice looking compact pen inspired package than can be opened by slicing the sticker-dot at the bottom. The stylus holder inside is made of sturdy material, so you can use it as permanent storage or display. Initially it is taped in place, so it won't move around before you buy it. The product information is on the back of the packaging, there's no user guide.Four stars for the device, plus a bonus star because of its unusual design. With hundreds of similar-looking generic styluses, it is nice to see someone try to do something different.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYK7MI4RJF4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R33ZWI2#wasThisHelpful","R1EYK7MI4RJF4E","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review from an absolute beginners perspective. I never used a laminator before. In the past, I took things to be laminated to copy and print places. I am often clumsy when it comes to arts and crafts without an undo button, so I was pleasantly surprised that everything worked right from the beginning. The pages got laminated perfectly, no bubbles, no issues, no problems.The device has to heat up before you can use it, I didn't time it but it took about 1-2 minutes at the 3 mil setting. It is basically ready before I am ready (get everything organized and arranged and clear space for the laminator). The device is warm to the touch when heated and in-use, but the surface the device sits on does not heat up. I give the laminator space on either end that is at least the length of the item to be laminated.The lamination process is straightforward, align the paper inside the pouch (I don't know why they call them pouches, they are essentially two thin slides glued together at the top), feed it to the heated laminator using the markings on the laminator while holding it straight and parallel to the desk, and watch it come out on the other side. The laminated item is warm initially but cools off quickly. There is a smell during lamination, which is not a surprise.The device has a power button (ON and OFF positions) on the back. I am mentioning this because some devices these days don't have physical on/off buttons.The box includes ten free 3-mil pouches packed separately and resealable on their own bag. They are not as thick/heavy as the ones I had laminated at copy and print centers (they may have used thicker pouches). The bag has a sticky part that is grabby, so pay attention when putting them back in.There are many uses for this, book maps, recipes, poems, prayers, music learning cheatsheets, and so forth. But perhaps my favorite use is as to-do lists and checklists and task/chore lists, using dry-erase markers to write on them. The writing is easy to erase with a dry-erase eraser or cloth.UNBOXING: It is easy to open with fingers, no tools needed. The outer packaging is the customary colorful Fellowes style you may have seen in their other products. You have a visual Quick Start Guide (pictures, no text). Then a two page written user guide in English and French and Spanish. This user guide is not tiny, it is 11.5 x 8 inches. You also get ten 9 x 11.5 inch Gloss 3 mil pouches sealed in their own pack. And of course the laminator, in a see-through bag with its edges protected by eggcrate type of material. Also included is an Exit tray (a wide square-shaped U). And a couple of other pieces of paper (warranty, etc).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R43U1WWSURR1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OILZLDI#wasThisHelpful","R43U1WWSURR1V","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tea brewing pitcher exceeded my expectations. You can brew as little or as much tea as you want, tea leaves or tea bags or both at the same time. I found it more versatile than a dedicated infuser like this one FORLIFE Brew-in-Mug Extra-Fine Tea Infuser with Lid(which I like, but only fits over coffee cups).There are two main components to this. The unibody 55oz pitcher, and the cover. The cover has the lid on top, and screwing on at the bottom of the lid is a three concentric disc filter mechanism. The filter is in the middle layer. The bottom layer has the base that screws on to the lid. The top disc is what keeps the cover from falling when you pour tea. The three layers are easily removable and cleanable on their own, and so is the lid. Unless you have big hands, you can easily reach the bottom of the pitcher and clean it.This is not a coffee press, the filter mechanism does not move up or down, it is fixed in place when attached, that's why you can use this to make anywhere from a drop of tea up to 55oz of tea. The lid rotates in place, and if you align the little symbol on the lid with the pouring side of the pitcher, you get liquid pouring out faster. The filter is very good at keeping things inside, it was more effective than my stand-alone infuser using the same loose leaf teas.The instructions recommend loose leaf tea but you can also brew tea bags or infuse anything else you want. For tea bags, I remove the tag and cut off the string with scissors before putting them in (beware of tea bags with staples). You can brew with boiling water or you can cold brew. The pitcher is a good fit for refrigerators (it is 11.5 inches tall, from the top of the lid to the bottom of the pitcher, 4.5 inches in diameter, with the handle extending up to an extra two inches out).The pitcher handles boiling water without issue. If you keep the lid closed, it can keep the tea warm longer than a coffee cup. I didn't do a side by side test, but I think it's not as effective as a specialized insulated container, but it's still better than keeping the tea in a closed-lid cup.Since most loose leaf teas can be rebrewed multiple times, if you don't pour all the brewed tea to your cups or teapot, you have to decide how to handle the tea leaves in between brewings. Especially for teas that can get bitter with over-brewing. It's easier to pour the liquid out than take the tea leaves out and then put them back in for rebrewing. Since the pitcher gives you total brewing flexibility in terms of quantity, the easiest way to handle this is to brew only as much tea as you plan to put in cups once it finishes brewing. Once you drink it all, brew it again, pour, and repeat later once again. Or use tea filter bags. (With tea bags this is not an issue since you can easily fish out the tea bags with a spoon).For warmer months, if you like to drink a hot cup of tea early in the morning and iced the rest of the day, you can brew a lot of tea in the morning, pour as much hot tea as you like, and let the rest cool off, and then refrigerate it.As the picture shows, this is clear material, so you can see the tea brewing inside. This is especially nice if you are brewing various tea blends with different colors and formations. If I want to stir things up while brewing, I use a circular motion parallel to the ground (not up and down), sometimes with a slight angle.The instructions (four page square in English and French) are well done, easy to read, simple and to the point and use pictures. The only thing that is perhaps not explained in detail is how to reassemble the 3-part filter mechanism. In case that's confusing, here's the order: the steering wheel is at the bottom (with the screwing part point up), the mesh filter in the middle, and the barbed wire thing at the top. The instructions say before first use, hand wash everything with warm soapy water and let them dry up. The filter part is very easy to clean once you disassemble it (only takes 10-20 seconds).Unboxing: it arrives in a protective cardboard box, and the packaging material can be recycled. Simple and easy to open.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J9GKXRHX9SD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QX99ZX0#wasThisHelpful","R2J9GKXRHX9SD2","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lightweight over-the-door hook rack, with six individual non-removable hooks.The design is nice, metal and see-through non-metal material. The OXO holds on to doors and other surfaces as seen in the picture. It is around 20.5 inches long (X axis, parallel to the ground), while the gap between the two feet on top that hold on to doors is a bit less than 17 inches. In other words, you need a door or surface that is at least 20 inches long. If you are hanging really fluffy items (such as ties), you may be able to get away with slightly less, but it depends on the situation.Each hook has two metal parts going into its base. Each hook is about one inch wide, one inch tall, and half inch thick. The top of each hook is not flat, but rounded in the X-axis (like a thumb is rounded up top). The distance between each hook is about 2.75 inches. The two outer hooks (left and right) can be just slightly angled towards the outside, this brings the distance between it and the nearest hook just under 3 inches.I use it to hang various lightweight items, it is great for hats, whether it is small hats (baseball, beanies, etc) that go on the hook, or longer summer or garden hats that you can hang either way (by the string or the hat itself). It is good for belts too as long as the buckle is big enough to fit into the hook or the belt is thin enough you can hang it evenly balanced, sideways on the book. It can also fit over the shower curtain rod if you want to dry out small items (eg hats or ties). Another use of this I like is as an organizer of the various reusable grocery and shopping bags.I am not fond of using racks on doors that open and close often, and I don't like to hang towels in this fashion (because no matter what, they end up on the floor), so I can't speak to how well it does there.Unboxing: it arrives in a cardboard box as is, without any packaging, with the instructions (14 x 8.5 inch cardboard) attached to the actual rack with three twisty ties. The twisty ties are made of material that reminds of paper clips, I had to use scissors to cut them because they did not untie easily like most twisty ties do (they were twisted too many times).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BCX0YH10K2F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034MWFBI#wasThisHelpful","R2BCX0YH10K2F2","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Kind bars, they won me over because I can actually see real food ingredients in them instead of a semi uniform paste of various unpronounceable things that may have once been food. So I was very curious to read this book from the founder!The best way to describe this nearly 300 page book is this: Part Inspiration, Part Business, Part Biography. All three elements are interweaved in the book, often in the same paragraph or sentence, making it an interesting non-formulaic read. You can read as much or as little at a time, this is not like a novel or a textbook. It's like the author wrote a book-long rap song about his life and career. There's even some dissing, eg the ""authentic purpose vs shallow cause marketing"" segment.The book is personal in nature, we get a lot of glimpses of the life and philosophy and personality of the author. You (and I) may not agree with everything the author writes and that's fine, we are not a choir of sheeple after all.Along the way we learn more about Kind bars and the business of nutrition bars, but this is not a Kind bar textbook, so if you are strictly interested in reading about Kind bars and nothing else, this is not so.If you are a Debbie Downer type, you may find some of the inspirational content annoying, but fear not, the author also points out several of his failed ideas and plans and projects, repeatedly (""the number of mistakes I made ... would require another few books"") and without sugar coating them. In conjunction with that, the author stresses the value of analyzing and learning from them while not turning the failures into a self-recrimination spiral. So it's not a rah-rah-rah let's all sing along and save the planet and solve every problem and make lots of money doing it book, but it can get syrupy and unicorny on occasion.Almost everyone who starts a business or a project has something to build upon (skills, funds, energy, resources, network, etc), some more than others, and in this case, on page #55, the author mentions that he borrowed $100K from his parents in the 90s. Not a small sum for certain and certainly many entrepreneurs may never have this option.There's an important lesson a lot of companies need to pay special attention to: ""inconsistency in a brand is like introducing a virus in your brand system"".My copy is full of sticky flags, which is a measurable signal of an interesting book. I rarely bother to use flags if I don't find a book interesting.This is very e-reader friendly, it is all text, with the exception of four charts towards the end that show Kind bar performance in the marketplace over time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CKUCP3H868K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553393243#wasThisHelpful","R30CKUCP3H868K","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a POS (point of sale) tablet stand but it has many other uses in offices and homes. It is solidly built and well-made and heavy. You can optionally bolt it (mounting hardware included). If you don't bolt it, treat it like any other heavy item - don't place it near the edges of surfaces and pay attention to kids and pets. The device is ready to use out of the box. You only need tools/hardware/assembly if you want to bolt it to a surface.The height of the device is not adjustable, but the main surface rotates 360 degrees, it can go from perfectly flat to perfectly vertical. You can use it in portrait or landscape, with the angle of view adjusting from perfectly flat to perfectly vertical, in all directions of the horizon.This is very versatile. The tablets are held in place at the two opposing corners as seen in the picture. One corner is fixed (no adjustments). The other corner is adjustable, both in width of tablet and height of tablet. The adjustments are made independently to factor for tall and/or wide tablets. The adjustments stay in place until you change them again.The design minimizes blocking of ports on the device, since you can rotate both the tablet (with the software) and the device physically. Unless your tablet has ports on three or four of its corners. A close-up of the pictures should give you a good estimate.It fits modern tablets that are 7"" and 8"". It also fits the original 7"" Kindle Fire (the one that shares the same shell as the Blackberry Playbook and is thicker than most of today's tablets). Modern 8"" tablets fit as well, such as the Galaxy Note 8. I doubt any 9"" tablets will fit, the Nook HD+ is simply too big to fit properly. If you have really old tablets (older than the original Kindle Fire), they may be too big, for example, I had a prehistoric 7"" Pandigital with 4:3 aspect ratio (running Android 2.1 or something like that) and it is too big.The sturdiness is especially welcome if you are writing one-handed on a tablet with a stylus, especially a stylus/digitizer tablet like the Galaxy Note 8 and others with similar technology. For example, taking notes while talking on the phone.As far as ebook readers, the only one that fits properly is the Kindle with Keyboard. The other ereaders I tried are too short (Nook Simple Touch, Kindle Paperwhite, the simple Kindle with buttons) for a proper fit.If your tablets are in protective backs or cases or folios, it depends on how well they fit. In general, the bigger and fleshier the case, the lower the chances of a good fit. The grips are just under 5/8"" deep, so you have flexibility there.Adventurous Users: if you are a higher risk user, and your device does not fit properly because either too big or too small, you can still use this by balancing the device in. You don't get a secure lock, so it is important to have it on a stable surface without kids/pets running around. You can balance it on one edge and use either dimension of the other edge, along with the angle of the device to have a balanced hold. I used this approach for devices as small as smartphones and the iPod Touch, and as large as 10-inch tablets. However, this is a high risk scenario, and not the intended use of this device. Consider it a bonus for adventurous users.UNBOXING: this is in a generic sturdy cardboard box (can be reused). Inside you will find the Instructions (two 8.5x11 sheets), filler material for packaging purposes, and of course the device covered in a see-through bag. The mounting hardware are in their one small resealable bag, taped to the bottom of the device. The mounting hardware consists of three nuts and three screws (both #8). In the bag you also find two keys if you want to lock the tablet in place (can be handy at home/office if you have guests/visitors/kids)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3537HVON43VNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUEFLCM#wasThisHelpful","R3537HVON43VNQ","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a budget coffee maker that makes one cup of coffee (8 to 14oz) at a time, using ground coffee, and comes with a permanent filter. It is best suited for occasional use, not as a daily workhorse. I bought this because occasionally I want to drink just a small cup of coffee and using a 10-cup coffee machine with a carafe and paper filters felt like overkill and wasteful.I've had it for about a month now, with occasional use and it works fine. However, this is a budget-made appliance, it's a couple of levels above ""hanging by a thread"" quality, so if you are a shopper who prefers solidly made appliances, this is definitely not the one for you.Upon first open, it has a distinct plasticky smell. I run it four times through with 14oz of water (that I threw away) before making coffee. I haven't found any information about BPA on the packaging, that's another reason why I think this is for occasional use.The water reservoir has markings for four different drink sizes, 8oz, 10oz, 12oz, and the maximum of 14oz (which is the maximum size the included white coffee mug can hold).This has a reusable coffee filter that is part of the coffee machine and it is removable for cleaning. The filter goes into its own little contraption. So no need for paper filters but you still have to clean the removable filter after each use.There is a red power button at the bottom left side of the device. You can see the button in the picture (which shows the button on the right side). I double-checked, the button on mine is on the left side. The button lights up when you power it on. The machine does not turn off on its own, but you can tell it's done when you hear it run out of water and the coffee stops dropping.There is no heating element at the bottom, so you have to drink the coffee when you make it or put it in a thermos or insulated coffee mug. The bottom is removable and cleanable, so any coffee that drops off can be easily cleaned. The coffee drops slowly, so you can quickly switch cups if you want to start drinking before it's done.You can use the included coffee mug or any other coffee mug that fits in terms of height and width on the base. Since the bottom is not heated, you don't have to worry about that. The tallest cup that fits well is about 5 inches. You may be able to partially squeeze in tall skinny cups (eg the $1 reusable Starbucks 16oz cup) but you have to make sure they don't fall over when they fill up. The base is about 5 inch wide and 4 inch deep, so some of the giant soup-like coffee mugs may not fit.Don't expect miracles in terms of coffee taste. Because of the nature of the filter, this is probably not a good idea for finer grinds. One of the reasons I got this was so I could finish all the ground coffee I currently have, so I did not experiment grinding the same coffee beans in different ways to figure out the best grind option.UNBOXING: everything inside the box is in an unsealed see-through plastic bag. Inside you will find the coffee machine with the cord twisty-tied, the user manual at the bottom, and the coffee mug sitting on the coffee machine (as in the picture), sealed in a seethrough bag with protective padding to keep it in place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E58IDGFA4KUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041GNZSS#wasThisHelpful","R1E58IDGFA4KUP","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great Dry Erase marker set with one caveat, the included eraser is good at cleaning recent writings, but if something's longer than a few hours, it's not as effective as other erasers (including another Quartet eraser from a different kit). This is a fluffy type of an eraser, it's a bad attempt to mimic the Expo eraser (which is heavier and more effective at cleaning, but still not as effective as the 3M 3M Whiteboard Eraser for Whiteboards, 2-Pack which is a lot more effective than it looks).Other than that, this is a great kit. The liquid board cleaner is very effective. I even used it on an old dry-erase board that hadn't been erased in many months (if not years), and the spray cleaned it up very nicely and easily. I prefer to use thick kitchen towels instead of a soft cloth, that way you just throw them away without having to worry how to wash away the chemicals of this liquid from a cloth. There are warnings on the bottle of the spray about eye contact and inhalation and being flammable and such, so be sure to read them, especially if you have sensitivities in those areas. The description says 2oz, however this is a 1.68oz bottle per the packaging and the writing on the bottle.The markers are great and they remain my favorite Fine Tip markers, winning over the Expo Fine Tip on multiple counts. The Quartet are physically slightly thicker, the writing tip is more rounded while the Expo is more pointed. The writing is also bolder and more satisfying with the Quartet. You get five markers, two black, one red, one blue, one green.Note: if you are not familiar with dry-erase markers, Fine Tip is thicker than it sounds. If you want truly Fine Tip (thinking along the terms of pen writing), the only one I found are the Expo Ultra Fine line, for example, Expo Low Odor Ultra Fine Dry Erase Markers, 4 Black MarkersThis Quartet set comes packaged as seen in the picture. It says Made In China on the back. You can open it and re-seal it by slowly peeling off the edges (eg use a letter opener). If opened gently, the packaging can serve as temporary or permanent storage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HUGVG0G7JJGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054TMPZU#wasThisHelpful","R1HUGVG0G7JJGT","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This easy to read and digest book makes the case for cheap and fast experiments as a valuable tool for innovators. It consists of two intermingled virtual parts, making the case for the 5x5 approach, and explaining how to put it to use. I read a couple of business books per year, and at this level, I found it educational. A more subjective metric on the usefulness of the book, I have dozens and dozens of sticky flags on many pages (I rarely use flags on books I don't find interesting).The style and tone is less consultant-y that you often find in this genre. While the author uses many examples of research and quotes, he avoids the constant name dropping of current and former clients that other authors do (which can make their books feel like glorified resumes). The ""Raising Keynes"" segment is quite visceral, a cross between a grudge and a vendetta and (regardless of where you stand on those theories) it's refreshing to see unfiltered opinions instead of having to read between the lines to find veiled hints of strong disagreement.There are some quotable lines to ponder and even occasional jokes that spring at you unexpectedly (Powerpoint presentations, strategic investments, etc). I don't know if this is a coincidence or an intentional homage, but at one point the author goes in Stephen R. Donaldson mode and drops an ""inchoate"". If I also noticed ""puissant"" or ""excoriation"" or ""chiaroscuro"" I would be certain :)Many of the examples used in the book, including the real world 5x5 examples and the Blockbuster story and Apple's antiperspirant mouse were great and helpful in understanding the concepts. The only one that stood out as not very helpful was the ""eat less and exercise more"". It felt out of phase. The book ends with a bibliographic essay which is a lot more helpful (than a list of references) for someone trying to prioritize what other books to read on the subject.The target audience are bigger businesses, not mom and pop shops or sole proprietors, but some of experimentation ideas could be helpful in some instances (after all, it advocates low cost experimentation before jumping to big decisions or making big changes).This book is all text, except for one simple diagram, which makes it a great match for reading on an e-ink e-book reader.Spoiler Alert: there is nothing magical or mystical with all the numbers being 5s (5 people, 5 days, 5 experiments, 5 weeks, $5K).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDO4VLGCKYPBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262028360#wasThisHelpful","RDO4VLGCKYPBX","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are nice as an occasional dessert. They are not a replacement for raw or dry roasted almonds and other nuts. They have enough sugar to only consider them as a dessert. But the kettle glaze gives them a different taste from raw almonds, so bonus points for variety. I like this raspberry-ish flavor, it wasn't quite raspberry (as in the fresh fruit), but it was a pleasant taste. Sometimes you may get hints of strawberry too, and looking at the ingredients list confirmed it, it has ""strawberry powder"". It was different enough from raw and roasted almonds to add variety. I finished this in two days when my plan was to finish them in seven days, so it has scoreboard.Another good use for them, if you create your own mixed nuts remixes, you can a small amount of these in the container or bowl for more variety and randomness.One resealable bag has 5oz. A serving is 1oz, which is 130 calories, 9g fat (0.5g saturated, 0g trans, 2g poly, 5g mono), 4g protein, 13g carbs (2g fiber, 10g sugar), 140mg sodium, 0mg cholesterol, and tiny amounts of calcium, iron and vitamin C. Raw almonds have more protein, more fiber, more fat, half the carbs (and just 1g sugar), and no sodium.The ingredients list is another reason why I consider them strictly a dessert: almonds, sugar, clarified red raspberry juice concentrate, strawberry powder, canola oil, natural flavors (including raspberry), salt, soy lecithin, citric acid. These are manufactured on shared equipment so it has a variety of allergen ingredients.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QC47Y1RN78A2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00REDUAHO#wasThisHelpful","R2QC47Y1RN78A2","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 5oz bag is sealed at the top, you tear at the top to open the bag, and then seal it using the built-in resealable mechanism. For bags with tea leaves, I also use a kitchen clip and put them in a tin or ziplocked bag. Upon opening the bag, it does not have a fragrant aroma. It is a subdued tea-ish smell. It is English Breakfast after all, not a flowery tea. It is different from their Tattle Tea Earl Grey Black Tea, which, still, five months after opening, has a nice bergamot fragrance. As expected.The package does not have an actual list of ingredients. It says it's just tea leaves. I don't know why they are not using a standard ingredients list.The package recommends 1-2 teaspoons for 3-5 minutes at 195 degrees. I brewed at 3, 4, and 5 minutes with 8oz to 12oz. I found the 3 minutes a bit too weak. I found 4 minutes to be the bang for the buck in re-brewing for me when using the same tea leaves. The first two cups are pretty good, the third and fourth are definitely weakener. The fifth is more colored water than tea.The benefits of loose leaf tea were obvious when brewing this in parallel with English breakfast tea bags (Trader Joe) and drinking back and forth between them. To summarize, the Tattle tea leaves had a three dimensional taste while the tea bags were two dimensional. Of course there is a higher price on the tea leaves, so it's up to the individual to decide where to draw the line on pricing.I also experimented blending this with other teas. Brewing them separately, and then mixing them in a separate cup. The biggest surprise was the Celestial Sugar Plum Spice, which has a rather obnoxious flavor (especially after the Holidays are over), but mixed together created an interesting flavor. The other experiment that I liked was with Chamomile tea.This is a straightforward black tea, so it may be a good idea if you are trying to cut back on Colas or black coffee, and don't want to deal with caffeine withdrawl headaches.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTT8SU3VQ7166/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGUQDKA#wasThisHelpful","RTT8SU3VQ7166","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though there are hundreds of TV dramas out there, there's not a lot of action in the alternate history genre. This alone makes this a promising TV show. Alternate history presents a blend of the known and the unknown. World history is as we know it before World War II, but in this universe, WW II has a different outcome, which means, we don't really know what happened since the 40s (except for what the TV show tells us). The show is in the alternate 60s, and while it has plenty of similarities to ""our"" 60s, there are some differences, extrapolations based on what had gone before.I haven't read the book, so I only know what the pilot episode showed. Minor spoilers on the pilot below...The pilot did a great job of world building, showing us digestable but memorable glimpses of the three main territories. The characters introduced were easy to identify and separate as individuals (something not always so in pilots). Even though none of the characters jumped out as a ""star"" or a larger than life character, they all felt organic to the story, as if we were looking at vignettes of their lives. A plus if you like serialized gray world stories. We got snapshots of plots and schemes in progress, teasers of potential outcomes, and more.Given the combination of the known and the unknown, this has a lot of potential to tell some very interesting and fairly unique stories to conventional TV, and present situations and dilemmas that challenge the viewer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZCXCJKYFTD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RSGFRY8#wasThisHelpful","R3OZCXCJKYFTD2","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a self-contained digital scale. No apps, no bluetooth, no wifi. Just a scale. When you step on, it first measures your weight. If you remain on the scale, it will then calculate the rest of your data. The instructions say it sends a tiny electric pulse to measure the extra data, but I haven't felt it, it must be very tiny. If you don't want the extra data, simply step off after the weight measurement is finalized.The extra data are in this order: BMI (a number), Body Fat (a percentage), Water TBW (a percentage), Muscle Mass (a percentage), and Bone Mass (in pounds).The Setup process asks you for height, weight, gender, and whether you are an athlete in order to determine how to calculate things. During Setup, you only have a few seconds to make selections, so you need to be ready to quickly press the buttons (which are on the scale). It is not a very patient setup process.It supports up to eight different profiles. If the different people using it have different enough weights, the scale automatically sorts out who is who. If the weights are closer, it will ask you to select which profile you want to use each time.The profile data you enter manually at setup (weight, height, gender, athlete) is stored on the scale and it is used to calculate BMI and the rest of the biometric data. The actual measurements (your weight, your BMI, etc) are not stored on the device. If you want to save it, you have to do it on your own. Perhaps pen/paper or take a short video of the measurements using your phone/tablet - if you don't have photographic memory.The instructions (in five languages) do a poor job of clearly explaining the scale's display, while they use up space on other less important matters. The user guide has small fonts.Before this, I was using this basic digital scale for about three years Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb. Capacity, Sense-On Technology. The readings from the Smart Weigh are about 0.2 to 0.4 lbs higher, I am assuming within the margins of error of each device.It has a button on the underside that allows you to switch between pounds, stone, or kilos as the measurement unit. The silver part is stainless steel and it feels colder on the feet than a basic non-stainless steel scale.The scale takes button cell batteries (installed at the underside), so no go if you are a fan of using rechargeable AA or AAA batteries. The batteries are preinstalled but you have to remove the protective plastic strip that prevents the batteries from draining while it's waiting to be purchased.The device is packaged in a pizza type of a box, with the scale unsealed in a see-through bag along with the user manual.Overall, given the budget price, this does what it promises to do. The setup may be frustrating, but you only have to do it once per user.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R263CRGLK7IL7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8FXDIQ#wasThisHelpful","R263CRGLK7IL7D","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Peeled Snacks Apple Clusters are a different way to eat apples. They don't look like apples, they are rolled up in little (slightly smaller than) marble-size airy crunchy clusters. The crunch is audible and satisfying but I felt no risk to my dental fillings because there's plenty of air in-between and the clusters break with fairly little effort.The taste is of course an apple taste. If you inhale them you may not notice this, but if you eat them slowly, you may notice, especially towards the end of the chewing, a sweetness that you don't get from eating regular apples. I would put this akin to apple juice, which is explained by the ingredients as these have not just organic apples but also organic concentrated apple juice. So if you are looking for just apples without the extra sweetening, this may not be to your liking.The expiration date is written on the back in normal human readable form. On the one I received, the expiration was 6.5 months into the future. The packaging says ""five apples inside"". One serving (the 2.1oz package has four servings) is 60 calories with 14g carbs (2g fiber, 10g sugars). Zeroes in all the other categories (fat, protein, sodium, cholesterol). It has nearly neglible amounts of Vitamin C (2%) and Calcium (1%). Unless you have a lot of self-control or pre-split the servings, more realistically, this will be gone in two, not four sessions.Labels on various parts of the packaging include Gluten Free, non-GMO, USDA organic, and All Natural.Pros: a different way to eat apples, handy and portable package, organic, non-GMO, simple ingredients list, better health-wise than almost everything sold at the checkout counter or convenient storeCons: price and the apple juice concentrate.

"The set includes five measuring cups and a scraper that also serves as a hanger for the set when it is clasped together. The whole set, clasped together, empty of any contents, weighs 6 oz. The measurements are written in a color-coded fashion on the side of each cup, and they are also engraved on the handle, right before the cup begins.One of the benefits of having a marker at the halfway point of each cup is that it effectively offers you two new measurements, 1/6th cup (half of the 1/3) and 1/8th cup (half of the 1/4) that are not included in the set. Thanks to the halfway point, you can use one measuring cup instead of two in some situations, for example if you need to measure 1/4 and 1/2 or 1/8 and 1/4.The actual snapping mechanism at the top of the handles has the same size, so you can snap as few as two together or as many as all of them. Because they are nesting cups, you always have to snap them from smallest to largest, whether its two, three, four or five.Vs Dollar Store Measuring CupsI have a set of measuring cups from the dollar store, and here are the differences between them:+ Oxo more heavy duty, thicker, more sturdy+ Oxo numbers color-coded on the side+ Oxo snap together+ Oxo has halfway mark in each cup+ Oxo includes a hanger / scraper+ Dollar Store: lower pricePACKAGING: this is very simple, customary Oxo packaging, just the cups snapped all together, attached to a colorful Oxo packaging (that has the product description) held together by two twisty ties.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32UQUW1F0Y0PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X2CWQ#wasThisHelpful","R32UQUW1F0Y0PY","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a versatile zippered sleeve for 7 inch tablets and ebook readers. It unzips only on two sides (top and right), and there are no straps inside, you just drop in your device inside and zip it up. The front face has a 3.5 x 5 inch mesh pocket with velcro to keep it closed. The mesh is semi seethrough, depending on how much light there is and how colorful the items you put inside. The zipper handle is a nice size (around 1.25"") with five stars engraved in it. A loop handle on the left side (about two inches) gives you another way to carry it.DEVICES: An 8"" Galaxy tablet was just too tall for the zipper to zip. A couple of 7"" tablets fit, a Kindle Fire and an old thick Android 2.x tablet. All the ebook readers I tried fit in comfortably, including the Kindle with Keyboard and the Nook Simple Touch and Paperwhite. These without anything on the tablets and ereaders. If you have a regular case on your device, it will probably be too thick to fit inside. However, if you have a slim fitting case it may fit just fine, for example, the Paperwhite in this type of a case Moko Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Case - The Thinnest and Lightest Leather Cover for Amazon All-New Kindle Paperwhite (Both 2012 and 2013 versions with 6"" Display and Built-in Light), BLACK fits very comfortably. Another data point: the Kindle with Keyboard inside its official Amazon case almost fits, so close, but it does not zip.And that's I think a great use for it. An extra level of protection for your ereader, in case of rain, sand, wind, and other situations. A case on its own won't necessarily protect from water or sand, but an extra bag can decidedly reduce risk. This is also handy if you put your cased ereader in a busy or active backpack or briefcase or handbag.HACKS: inside the sleeve, there is a little white loop, just like linen and clothing have that says ""Made In China"". If you have a thin stylus or pen, you may be able to squeeze it along with an ereader. I can do this with the Paperwhite in the slim case I mentioned above, but there's not enough room for a 7"" tablet.UNBOXING: The sleeve is inside a closed see-through bag which is inside the packaging that says Acco Brands and Made In China. The sleeve is empty, no throwaway padding inside. Empty, the sleeve weighs 2.6 oz on its own. This is a not a paper-thin sleeve, but it's not the thickest either. If you need a sleeve to survive harsh environments, this is probably not it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUBYVOB1Y8P0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2ULL40#wasThisHelpful","R2FUBYVOB1Y8P0","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The flexibility of the gooseneck and the wide round base and the clip that can attach to various surfaces up to 3/4 inch thick make it a versatile all around light. More than 3/4 inches I feel would put too much stress on the spring mechanism (but I could be wrong). It is small enough to take with you, or use in a variety of situations, such as a bed light or a small emergency light or small closet light or car light or computer light and so forth.E-READERS: This is usable with ebook readers, however, if you are planning to use this as a dedicated ebook reader light, you are better off getting a specialized ereader light. The way the two light bulbs are set up, you can't get the whole page (even on a 6-inch reader) evenly lit. I tried different angles and approaches, none got it evenly lit. There is plenty of light to cover more than a 6 inch screen, but it's not evenly distributed. The other thing to note for ebook readers, the base of this requires about 1 inch of space to attach. Most ereaders don't have a 1-inch bezel, plus I don't feel comfortable having something put constant pressure on the actual device. So I recommend attaching this on the reader case (a lot more surface and flexibility) than the actual device.BOOKS: With Paperbacks (mass market or larger), you have to attach this to more than just the back cover. You have to grab a handful of pages, otherwise gravity will pull it down. Adjusting the angle and position of attachment can cover most of the reading area. With Hardcovers, the back or front cover is strong enough to hold it on its own. But for larger hardbacks, it's hard to get both pages illuminated.MAGAZINES: most magazines have soft covers, so it's the same issue as Paperbacks - you have to attach it to a handful of pages, or use one your hands to support it so it doesn't move or flop around. This can be useful if you are reading individual articles, but if you are flipping randomly through the magazine, this can be frustrating. Plus you have the issue of glossy magazine page reflections and such.NICE TRICK: if you flex the neck in certain ways and angles, you can have it sit on a desk like a tiny desk lamp, without actually attaching it to anything (it obviously falls very easily if not attached to something).POWER: This takes button cell batteries, so you can't use rechargeables. The benefit is that you have a smaller and lighter device versus one that takes AAA or AA batteries. But you can't use rechargeables. This is a general trade-off, not unique to this device.UNBOXING: the package is easy to open. The light is the only thing inside. The batteries are pre-installed. The power button is easy to turn on and off and you can't turn it on accidentally. The instructions are part of the packaging, so bonus points for not using additional material unnecessarily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VMI6FANQ4DO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFUAZPA#wasThisHelpful","R2VMI6FANQ4DO3","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SUMMARY: comfortable earphones despite their oddball looks, they insist on staying on your ears, and are perhaps best suited for consumers who enjoy a variety of modern music genres. Include zippered case and five eargel sizes. Buttons work on iOS, but sadly a mixed bag on Android, and nothing works on Windows Phone.SOUND: I listened to a variety of modern musical genres with a variety of portable devices and laptops. I found nothing offensive or objectionable in the sound. I was able to get lost in the music multiple times (for example, Rush, Sade's voice, etc), a sign of musical enjoyment. To summarize their sound signature, I think these are tuned for the average music listener in mind, one who likes to listen to different styles of modern music (rock, R&B, alternative, indie, pop, hip hop). Probably not for dedicated shake-my-foundation bassheads, and perhaps not for audiophile sound purists. This is not to say they are light on bass, for example, there is plenty of it in Sade's Solider of Love album (some audiophiles may say it's a bit too much), but on the other hand, they don't turn Rush into a basshead experience.ISOLATION: If you can get a good seal, they do a pretty good job of blocking out a lot of the outside world noise. They do not leak much sound either. In a fairly quiet room, volume halfway on a Clip Plus, I can barely hear them if I hold them two feet away from my ear. The earphone head is solid, no openings other than the speaker part, which helps with the keeping noise out and your own music in.COMFORT: As earphones, they are very comfortable to wear. I did not experience any discomfort or frustrations that I sometimes do with earphones that go inside the ear. I am getting a nice seal, and they stay on my head and don't fall off. I haven't used them for exercise, but while sitting on a desk, or walking from place to place indoors and doing light household chores, they stay put. Their unusual shape is perhaps what gives them these ergonomic benefits. Having said all that, head shape and size, sensitivities and preferences vary from person to person.CABLE: The 4 foot non-removable cable is fairly silent and tangle free. The only time I notice cable sounds is if I intentionally play with it. It has a 90 degree angle, with three rings. I don't use huge cases. Of the combinations I used I did not have any issues with the cable not fitting into the port/case. The buttons and mic are on a rectangular mini protrusion on the left side, they start about 7 inches from the top of the earphone, so for many people, it will be below their chin. The buttons and mic protrusion on the left side is the easiest way to tell the left and right side.BUTTONS (iOS): this is a Made for Apple devices product, so the buttons worked as expected with multiple apps. Volume Up and Down (self explanatory). The middle button one click toggles play and pause. Two clicks in succession takes you to the next track. Three clicks in succession takes you to the previous track.  Some apps, especially audiobook and podcasts may have different default settings for the two click and three click, so check the Settings if it is not behaving as expected.BUTTONS (Android): a mixed bag. The Volume Up/Down did not work with any of the three Android devices I tried (Nexus Lollipop, Galaxy Kitkat, and Gingerbread). Play and Pause worked with every device and app combination I tried. The Next/Previous function varied depending on app and device. Next worked more often than not, while Previous was the other way round. Apps I used: default Android Music app, Google Play, Poweramp, n7, Winamp, Amazon Music, Media Monkey and a few more.BUTTONS (Windows Phone): Nothing worked with four different apps. Tried a Lumia phone running WP 8.1 and an Acer Switch detachable (both Desktop and Metro side).INCLUDED: the headphones, a zippered case (roughly 3.5 by 3.5 by 1.5 inches; has pockets on each side on the inside), four sets of eargels in a small bag inside the zippered case (plus another set  preinstalled on the headphones), 1/4"" adapter, getting started guide in multiple languages (covers two models, M100 (this one) and M200), and tiny QC note with a date. The outside box they come in looks nice and presentable for gift giving purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAMPL0A82SLZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWRO7H0#wasThisHelpful","RAMPL0A82SLZP","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Strong Kind bars are a new, different kind of Kind bars. They are savory and spicy, a departure from the 20+ ""conventional"" Kind bars. If you are a regular Kind bar fan, you are in for a surprise. If you are looking for a similar taste, you may not like them. It took me at least three bars before I finally started getting down the taste signature of these bars. As with other Kind bars, you can actually see real food ingredients, full size almonds and pumpkin seeds. I give them as a group a 4.5, averaged up for being bold enough to try something different.There are five different flavors, but they share the same core ingredients, almonds, pumpkin and hemp seeds, honey, non-GMO glucose, and pea crisps. Different spice combinations and additional ingredients are what differentiate the taste. Variation on a theme is a good way to describe them. Each bar has a spice meter on the back of the wrapper, but personally, I found the spiciness to be in the same ballpark. All five have some level of stickiness, some a little bit more than others (perhaps depending on the temperature too).All five are 0% cholesterol, 0mg trans fat, 15g carbs (3g fiber, 6g sugars), 10g protein,and a variety of vitamins and minerals.ROASTED JALAPENO: 230 calories, 16g fat (1.5g saturated),  6% sodium (140mg) sodium. First ingredients in the list: almonds, pumpkin seeds, honey, non GMO glucose, pea crisps and more. It has a 4+ out of 6 on the Spice Meter. This is not as sticky as some of the others. It is my favorite of the group.HONEY MUSTARD: I like the honey mustard taste, and it is distinctive in this case, so this emerged as my #2 favorite. 230 calories, 16g fat (1.5g sat), 5% 115mg sodium. First ingredients are almonds, honey, pumpkin seeds. It has 4+ on the spice meter. The spiciness has a little bit of a delay factor before it kicks in.HICKORY SMOKED: this is my favorite smoked flavor. It has 230 calories, 16g fat (1.5g sat), 5% 125mg sodium. First ingredients are almonds, pumpkin seeds, honey, etc. It has 1 out of 6 on the Spice Meter, and in this case, my taste buds agree, this is probably the least spicy of the group.THAI SWEET CHILI: 230g calories, 16g fat (1.5g sat), 15g carbs (3g fiber, 6g sugars), 5% 125mg sodium. First ingredients: almonds, honey, nonGMO glucose, pumpkin seeds, etc. It is at the halfway point of the Spice Meter. As the name suggests, it has hints of thai flavor. Its spiciness is slightly different from the group, but still falls under the same umbrella.HONEY SMOKED: 230 cal, 16g fat (1.5g sat), 5% 120mg sodium. First ingredients: almonds, pumpkin seeds, honey, non-GMO glucose, pea crisps, etc. Not as sticky as some others. There are hints of smoked flavor but personally I prefer the Hickory for the smoked taste. Its spice meter is 2 out of 6, but to me, it tastes similar to others in terms of spiciness. This is perhaps a little bit more dry than the others. This is my least favorite of the group.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39506EOMIQ5ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JA9LDH6#wasThisHelpful","R39506EOMIQ5ZK","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially I thought I had received a factory lemon. Then I read some of the newer reviews pointing out that the directions on the underbelly of the keyboard were directing you to put the batteries in the wrong direction. I never had this happen with a product before, so it didn't even cross my mind. Thanks to the folks who pointed this out! Once I put the batteries in the other way, it worked fine right away.But the keyboard issues do not end there. There is no power button on the keyboard. There is no power light, no caps lock light, no num lock light. Darkness. It has two legs underneath to adjust the typing angle. It may look like the keyboard might be a slave to the mouse, however, the keyboard still works after you turn off the mouse. The keyboard is also a bit too fleshy (for lack of a better word). It does have a row of multimedia buttons at the top.The mouse has a power button at the bottom, and a red light underneath while it is powered on. It has two buttons and a scroll wheel that also works as a middle button click. Overall, I like the feel and ergonomics of the mouse. Compact enough but comfortable and usable. You can store the USB dongle underneath the mouse, when you open the battery compartment, which has a plastic tab that lets you easily pull out the batteries (two AAA). The batteries sit at a 45 degree angle inside the mouse.There are two risk concerns on the mouse: the battery cover has a horizontal slit, so if you are using it at places with dirt or dust, they may end up getting inside. The other risk item, the way the battery compartment closes, it makes me feel like it may break (the thin part above the slit). But I haven't had an issue with either one after a few weeks.In addition to working with a Windows desktop computer, these worked with a Chromebook and a Windows 8 detachable tablet. I even attached the wireless dongle to a USB OTG cable attached to the micro-USB port of the tablet, and both the keyboard and mouse worked fine.For a budget combo set, I would give the Mouse 3.75 stars, and the Keyboard 2.25 stars. The battery instruction issue eats up another full star from the combined total.IN THE BOX: you get the keyboard and mouse in their own unsealed see-through bags. They have tape on them for extra protection from scratching. You also get two sets of two single use AAA batteries (total of 4 AAA), plus some paperwork (including a user guide).Vs Logitech MK270 combo: they go for a similar price range. I prefer the Logitech Keyboard (has its own power button) and the AmazonBasics mouse (better ergonomics). For a few days I actually used these two, I had the two USB dongles on a USB hub, so they didn't eat up precious USB ports.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1714YB4XABKQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7GV4JC#wasThisHelpful","R1714YB4XABKQ0","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This USB 2.0 microUSB to USB cable charged every device I tried, charging about ten different devices (smartphones of various OSes, external keyboard, external phone batteries) on a PC. The color is a mellow-yellow, not shiny-yellow as it looks in picture #1. Picture #3 is closer to its true color. The color is a great way to color code your charging cable drawer or box. In this case, yellow means you have a long microUSB to USB cable.The cable weighs 1.7 oz, and is around 71 inches (approximate measurement) - it is a 6ft cable. This is handy if you use this on a tower computer on the floor or want to cross distances. If you have a USB hub on your desk, this cable may be too long (depending on your setup).It arrives in a sealed white bag, with the usual suffocation warnings. It is easy to open, pull at the perforation to open. Inside you will find the cable held together by two twisty ties and a little piece of paper pointing you to the Amazon page for more details on the product. That's what's included.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IN4RSQ5DRWTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4SI2EG#wasThisHelpful","R2IN4RSQ5DRWTA","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hoping to keep this a short and concise review. This is the shortest I could do :)TOP HEAVY: as a laptop, this is top heavy, which is not a surprise, since the screen is also a fully-fledged tablet, while the keyboard is just a keyboard and nothing else. Not a big deal, but it's something to be mindful when holding or opening it if you are used to conventional laptops which feel more balanced even at the 11.6"" screen size. Speaking of opening, this requires conscious effort to open. A plus if you have a problem with laptops opening on their own, a minus if you like to easily and single-handedly open laptops.DETACHING: the attaching and detaching is easy, no special skills needed. Just align it and the strong magnet grabs a hold of it. When attaching, be careful not to get your fingertips caught between the tablet and keyboard part. It is a strong magnet. Mine didn't get caught but if you are not paying attention, it may happen. Detaching is simple as well... Sometimes when detaching/attaching, an on-screen message appears telling you to eject the device using the System Tray before you physically remove it. However, there is nothing in the System Tray for ejecting the keyboard. Not sure why you would need to anyway, since the keyboard is just a keyboard. Maybe I'm missing something... The Display Mode here is a bit different, the keyboard does not rotate all the way or sideways. Instead, you put the tablet backwards on the keyboard, so the screen is facing you, and the keyboard is behind the screen. Useful for watching movies, slideshows, reading books, flipping through magazines, essentially it's a tablet on a stand.KEYBOARD: for a 10-inch keyboard, I was pleasantly surprised with A-Z (letters) and numbers touch-typing. The letters are a decent size and with good spacing for touch typing. However, a lot of the other keys are small to smaller. There's only one CTRL (left side). The Escape is really tiny. The arrow keys occupy a tiny rectangle area on the bottom right corner of the keyboard. It has very tiny Page Up and Page Down buttons that don't need FN. With FN, those two become Home and End... There are no lights of any kind on the keyboard, caps lock changes show on the screen only. The virtual keypad is pressing FN and a few letters/numbers on the middle-right side. You are better off attaching a USB numeric keypad if you have to do any serious data entry... There are no dedicated music play/pause buttons, however, if you press the FN plus mute or volume up/down keys on the keyboard, it brings up the playback app on the screen which has play/pause (depending on which music app you are using)... There's only so much one can squeeze on a 10"" laptop keyboard... The keyboard does not have legs, however, I never felt the need to prop it up. The further back you push the screen, the higher the keyboard angle gets, so you have some flexibility there... On clean marble type surfaces, especially when the keyboard is brand new, it has a tendency to glide a little bit, so be mindful of that... X-Files: there is a magnetic area on the rightmost side of the palm rest of the keyboard (it decisively grabs paper clips) - rightmost edge, below the right arrow. Not sure why.OTG PARTY: the micro-USB port on the tablet side worked with an OTG (microUSB to USB) cable. I was able to attach (one at a time) a USB keyboard, USB mouse, wireless USB dongle (for wireless keyboards/mice). The wireless keyboard and mouse also worked on the keyboard's USB 2.0 port. This worked with two different mouse/keyboard combo sets (Logitech MK270 and AmazonBasics). You can have a keyboard and mouse party, with multiple sets of them connected and working at the same time :)... Speaking of connections, the instructions that come with it suggest that if you are going to connect external spinning hard disks, to power the hard disks on their own (not use  the Switch's USB power)TOUCHPAD: the touchpad is nice for a small keyboard, you get an area of roughly 9x5 cm. The two finger tap (mouse right click equivalent) is pretty handy. What is sorely missing is the three finger horizontal swipe to switch tabs within a browser (ChromeOS). You have options for adjustments in the settings.Micro-HDMI: using a random micro-HDMI to HDMI cable, I connected it to a TV/monitor. You have multiple options, extend the screen, duplicate the screen, or use the TV only (the tablet screen turns off). When you duplicate, you only get a smaller window on the TV (if your TV is more than 1280x800). When you extend or use the TV only options, it fills up the whole TV screen (1080p screen in my case). It is quick and easy to switch between duplicate, extend, TV-only, tablet-only.BUTTON PRESS ROW: the Power and Windows buttons are both on the same side (right side) and depending on how you are handling or storing the tablet or laptop, you can easily press either one of them accidentally. The headphone port is nearby as well, another opportunity for an accidental button press while adding/removing headphones. It may take a couple of weeks to get used to it. After about 3 weeks, I no longer press them accidentally. Initially I was frequently hitting either the Power or Windows buttons... By the way, the Volume Up/Down buttons on the tablet side increase/decrease the volume by 2% with each press.WATCHING VIDEOS: only some of the major video streaming apps are available in the Windows Store (I used Flixster, WatchESPN), however, you can switch to the Windows Desktop side for a lot more options. I streamed videos without issue from Amazon Instant Video and M-Go using Firefox with Silverlight, and also watched iTunes TV shows downloaded (if you don't have to have an iPad, a Windows 8 tablet is an affordable way to watch your iTunes movies/videos!)... Speaking of WatchESPN, I watched a couple of basketball games, and it was pretty good. Despite the small screen, I was able to easily read the player's jersey numbers and follow the action without issues or distractions. The screen was able to handle the fast paced action... The tablet has front speakers, facing you in laptop mode and tablet (landscape) mode. As with most small devices, there's only so loud they can get. In noisy situations, headphones or external speakers are probably needed...BLUETOOTH: I did not have any issues with the bluetooth devices I connected (headphones and mouse).CHARGING: while charging, the light is orange. When charging is complete, it turns to blue. The charging light is on the opposite side of the charging port, which can be confusing because the headphones port and charging port are similar in size (but if you look closely, there is a marking on the charging port). Charging happens through the charging port using the included AC adapter. It is a compact adapter. Vertically, it only takes one spot on the wall (use top or bottom if you have more than two). The only removable part of the AC adapter is the charging head (only one is included for North America). It does not appear to charge via USB. I never saw a charging light when connected to a PC.INSTALLATION/SETUP: fill up the coffee machine. It took me about two hours wall time to get all the updates and upgrades through Windows Update. Lots of reboots. Lots of them! You don't have to stare at the screen for those two hours straight, but you need to glance at it every few minutes. You can use a local account or Microsoft account. You need a Microsoft account in order to get a free app from the Windows Store. You only need to add a credit card if you want to buy a premium app... Boot to Desktop is one of the options in the handy Acer Shortcut app that lives in the system tray and task bar... There are plenty of customizations and adjustments to make, if you jump into the various settings and options on the Metro and Desktop side.CASES: I haven't looked for a custom case for this, since I mostly use it as a laptop when I am on the go, and whatever worked for other laptops, works for this too. Of the universal tablet cases I tried for the tablet-only, this tablet was a bit too long for them.OFFICE 365: you get a one year subscription to Office 365. You don't get the Office software to own forever. A product key is included in the packaging that activates your subscription. It is ""Office 365 Personal for Windows 8.1 with Bing for Small Tablets"". It says you must redeem by 12/31/16.BLOATWARE: McAfee is the most annoying. You get a 30 day trial. It comes activate. Site Advisor is also installed. It is a two step uninstall. First uninstall as usual from Control Panel, then download (!) an uninstaller program from McAfee to completely get rid of it. Windows includes its own security software (Defender and Firewall), so it takes over within seconds after you get rid of McAfee.MEASUREMENTS: out of the box, the 64GB version has 46.8GB available... The processor is the Intel Z3735F 1.33 GHz (the last time I looked there were two different processor mentioned in the description)... It is 32-bit Windows 8.1 with Bing... Tablet weighs 1 lb 3.8 oz on its own. Keyboard weighs 1 lb 2.2 oz on its own. As a laptop, it weighs 2 lbs 6.1 oz. The AC adapter weighs 3.4 oz... Made in China says the included paperwork.DESKTOP SIDE SAVES THE DAY: as of review time, the Windows Store still has a big gap in the popular apps versus iOS/Android. Not just the number of apps but the features as well. For example, Evernote Touch and Kindle (no zoom!) are subpar on the Windows Store side vs their iOS/Android versions. What saves the day for those, and many others, is that you can simply switch to the Desktop, and either use the Windows Desktop app or use the Browser for the web interface. A 10-inch screen, and a nice one at that, is quite usable for many of the non-complicated Windows Desktop apps. Case in point, I prefer the Evernote and Kindle desktop apps over their Windows Store versions... Not all Windows Store apps are subpar. For example, the Amazon shopping app scrolls sideways at a blazing speed, and the WatchESPN app is pretty smooth...Vs CHROMEBOOKS: Chromebooks finally have competition. The SSD makes a noticeable difference in the usability of Windows versus Windows laptops with slow spinning hard disks. I end up using this more often than the Chromebook, which was not the case with my previous hard disk based Windows laptop. Of course you still have the usual Windows issues and annoyances and quirks and irritations, but you have more flexibility, for example you can install as many browsers as you want (an easy way for multiple people in the same household to keep their stuff separate without having to log-in and log-out all the time). Chromebooks now have Multi-SignIn which is an improvement, but not as flexible as separate browsers.AVID READER TIP: arrange the tablet in Display Mode (tablet in front of the keyboard), attach a USB mouse, sit back on your chair, and use the scroll wheel of the mouse to change pages in the Kindle reader app. Lean Back Reading!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBDM1E66OY12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGK92IM#wasThisHelpful","RBDM1E66OY12","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The soap is gentle and soft. If you are familiar with the white Dove bar soap, it is quite similar in feel, smell and texture. If you spent a whole day rolling in the dirt, bar soap is more effective but other than that, it's all good. The practicality of the pump makes this more user-friendly, especially for anyone switching from bar soaps.The pump is touch sensitive, the softer you press it, the less you get. So the savings can add up over time depending on your showering technique and style and preferences. You can use the pump with your thumb pressing down and your palm collecting the soap, or if you are taking a bath, and you have to pump soap from a different/unusual angle, you can press with the fingers and collect the soap alongside your thumb.The container is reusable, when it runs out, you can open it and refill it with any soap you like or repurpose it. You just screw/unscrew it. The whole blue pump comes off naturally.One word of caution: this is, to borrow a Vitalism, a space-eater container. It has 34oz of soap plus the weight of the container and with a low center of gravity. You don't want this dropping on your toes, so if you are going to put it anywhere above knee level, make sure it is secured!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N3PB15F7UOH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MEDOY2G#wasThisHelpful","R1N3PB15F7UOH3","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a simple, unibody, single color fruit bowl. The fruit bowl weighs 15.3oz on its own (empty). It has 11 inches diameter at the opening at the top. It is around 4.5 inches tall. The bowl sits flat on a surface using three glued-on ball-shaped legs. The distance from the center of the bowl at the bottom to each ball-leg is around 3 inches. The distance from leg to leg (triangle) is around 5 inches.I randomly put items in, up to the rim. The following items fit: five bananas, four medium to large apples, one lemon, one avocado, two small plums. You can obviously stack more items above the rim, and if you organize them, you can squeeze in some more.A tiny piece of paint (under 0.5cm) fell off while unboxing it. I don't know if this was an isolated incident or a shape of things to come.There is no assembly required. You get the fruit bowl in a see-through plastic bag which you can repurpose for other reasons (eg put recyclables in before taking them out for recycling).

"The first ingredient in the list for the Oatmeal Chocolate Chip flavor (I haven't tried any of the others) are dates. So this sets the expectations in terms of sugar content. A typical date is around 55-65 calories, mostly sugar. The dates are prominent here, both in taste and in appearance. Initially (before I read the label) I thought the brown parts of the bar (intermixed with the oatmeal color) were from the chocolate, but it's mostly from the dates. Dates are a natural food but they are naturally very sugary.Overall, I liked the taste, but some may find it a bit too date-intense. One experiment I tried to tame the date taste succeeded: I dusted the bar with unsweetened cocoa powder (tumaco, the Trader Joe kind). It managed to mellow it down. The side effect of course is that there's cocoa powder everywhere, so that can get messy if you are at work or on the go or at school. This experiment may perhaps suggest that a dark chocolate version may taste better! I would rate it around 3.75 out of 5, but since ratings are whole numbers, it gets rounded up to 4.The packaging promotes that the bar has only ten ingredients, but unlike some of the Kind bars that have only natural foods, you still find some of the processed food favorites: the list, per the box: dates, soy protein isolate, invert evaporated cane syrup, rolled oats, chocolate chips (ev. cane syrup, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa butter), high olec safflower oil, whey protein isolate and of course natural flavors. So while they get credit for limiting the crapola, they are not exactly eliminating them.The ""Use By"" date is written on the side in human readable form which a plus (eg 1JUL2015). The box says these are ""Gluten Free"" but has the usual allergen warnings: contains soy and milk - manufactured in a facility that processes peanuts, tree nuts, egg and wheat ingredients.The standout nutritional elements are 10g of protein and only 4% sodium (105mg) per bar and 0mg cholesterol and 0mg trans fat. The rest of the numbers: 170 calories, 5g fat (2g saturated), 23g carbs (2g fiber, 17g sugars), and single figure percentages in potassium, iron and calcium. The nutritional information is both on the box and on the individual wrappers.They arrive in a relatively short box (5.75 x 10 x 2 inches) that is not sturdy enough to be reused. It has a perforated tear-up part so that you can easily open and reclose it.Versus Pure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie Bar=============================================The above Pure Bar is currently one of my favorites (half dessert, half nutrition), so here's a quick comparison:* Pure tastes better* Pure has 0% statistical sodium (5mg)* ZonePerfect has more protein and less fat* Pure has more fiber but also 20 more calories* ZonePerfect has 3g of carbs less* Pure has organic ingredients* Pure has more natural ingredients: dates, agave nectar, brown rice protein, cashew butter, almonds, walnuts, cocoa","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZR9O3K5C6KA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLULABU#wasThisHelpful","R31ZR9O3K5C6KA","AYNAH993VDECT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYNAH993VDECT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was gifted to me and while initially I didn't see the point in  a mouse without extra buttons / gestures etc, I stand corrected.I use it with a Windows 10 computer with 22 inch screen, so lack of horizontal scrolling doesn't affect me.The touch scrolling is more precise and easier than wheeled mice I tried over years (I usually stuck with Logitech). The clicking sound that the mouse generates in response to your scrolling speed is also way more enjoyable than I'd expect, makes one do unnecessary scrolls at times, even.I've had zero connectivity problems since I purchased it a month ago (tried getting up to 6-7 feet away without problems).It does work quite satisfactorily on computer chair arm supports, clothing, desk (both a solid wood one and one covered with glass) etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33FCGQRZU07LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CP4PIW#wasThisHelpful","R33FCGQRZU07LU","AA1ZYCEKJGG3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1ZYCEKJGG3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This case seems to me to be a hybrid between 'minimal' keyboard/cases produced most famously by logitech, and more protective cases that rarely feature a keyboard. Below are some bullet points and my comments. I also included photos next to an Iphone 6 to convey the dimensions, and a few in different angles.CONNECTIVITY/BATTERY USAGE (5/5): Had no problems since my purchase, only had to charge it with the micro usb cable once in over 3 months. My experience was identical to that with Logitech cases.PROTECTION & DURABILITY (4/5): I ended up testing the protective capabilities of the case, unwittingly, a few times (mostly 3-4 feet drops). The Ipad did not get detached, nor show any signs of damage. Even better, neither did the cage. While the moving joint part (grey) looks iffy at first, it was made to carry the ipad's weight many times, and still works as it did the first day.ERGONOMICS (4/5): By bluetooth keyboard standards, the keyboard is comfortable and painless. The key alignments are standard, no bad surprises there. The keys are just deep and clicky enough, though slightly hollow (then again, all bluetooth keyboards I tried feel that way). The case could ideally be designed to allow a wider spectrum of angles, but as is, it provides gradations between 90 and ~135 degrees.DESIGN (3/5) : Two issues holding me back from giving 5 stars are the bulk and the design/materials. While the extra bulk is inevitable for the added protection, the materials and design give a (probably unintended) 90s retro vibe by looking more like old pc-towers than a sleek apple accessory. .CONCLUSION: If you're looking for both protection and a headache-free bluetooth keyboard in one package, I can recommend this case without qualms. Unless you need  water or kid resistance, this case should offer enough protection for most use cases, at the expense of a bit of added bulk.DISCLOSURE: I was provided a free item for my honest review by New Trent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CR6BWYB3KPK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HMO6A6#wasThisHelpful","R2CR6BWYB3KPK4","AA1ZYCEKJGG3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1ZYCEKJGG3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me see if I can express this intelligibly: The upmost letter row is not misaligned, strictly speaking, but the absence of the 'tab' key before the Q makes it feel so, and if you're used to typing on a computer like I am, owing to the way you naturally place your left hand on the keyboard, your left hand will hit the key next to the one you were aiming for (R instead of E, T instead of R, etc.) on that entire row, whenever you're typing without looking, which I'd imagine would be quite often if you're a seasoned typer like me.Since I switch back and forth between a MacBook and this, every time I switch I need to get used to not relying on the natural alignment of my left hand  all over again. As a result, instead of typing faster compared to the onscreen keyboard, I end up typing slower.It's a pity since I've used the Logitech (full-size) ultra-thin Ipad keyboard for years with great joy, and expected this to be close, if not identical, to its bigger brother in typing comfort. I'm also quite comfortable on the generic Bluetooth keyboards.I should note, to be fair, that everything else about the keyboard seems to be quite optimal.Even after giving up on  this, I'll still be using Logitech products on my desktop and for the (fullsize) Ipad.

"SAFETY: While using a bottom-zippered laptop compartment is alarming at first, I've spent a lot of time with my Macbook Air 11.8"" (an early version weighing ~2.4 pounds) inside this bag, both on foot and on the bike, and haven't seen the zipper move so much as half an inch during these trips. Can't  speak for significantly heavier laptops, but with mine I definitely feel safe using this bag. It's also water resistant, which I had occasion to test during a few drizzles, no complaints.FUNCTIONALITY: For a bag this size, it's hard to imagine more functional pockets fitted into this form. Keep in mind that the front compartment is almost full if the grid-it inside is stocked with items, but you can still slide in an ipad and a medium paperback behind the grid it. (Alternatively, you can slide an ipad or two next to the laptop). There is another pocket, with even  smaller pockets inside, behind  the front one, which is pretty narrow but perfect for less frequently accessed items A4 folders, change etc, and than there is the open back pocketBIKING: Since the bag is made up of two separate compartments (the one that holds the laptop, and the front part), held together by a clasp, you can put it on the bike so that the bar is between the compartments, and clasp it on the bottom for safety.I've ridden well over 200 miles in that configuration, and if anything I trust the bag more with each trip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R152KXO2JY0CZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003M0HH0Q#wasThisHelpful","R152KXO2JY0CZ8","AA1ZYCEKJGG3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1ZYCEKJGG3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've read about it in bike forums, and indeed it's every bit as effective as the expensive alternatives I used in the past.For chain-cleaning, instead of choosing between the traditional approach (with rags and brushes) and cleaner-machines, I prefer to do a  combination of the two.

"To quote my shrink's two warnings:1 ) Def. to be taken on an empty stomach, and no eating an hour after taking SAM-e either. Not doing this nullifies the benefits.2) Only works for minor depression, major depression patients have not been shown to benefit from SAM-e.SCIENTIFIC VIEWS/DOSAGE: Among OTC supplements, SAM-e and St John's Wort are the ones the benefit of which are most reliably demonstrated by research (as a brief trip down PubMed articles will show you). If planning to go the natural remedy way, start with either. Adding some Omega-3 can't hurt too; while its mood-benefits are still contested, it has many other perks.As for dosage, there are some articles claiming that common SAM-e dosages are extravagant, and comparable benefits can be obtained by much lower doses, so start with 100 mg, and increase when necessary.MY EXPERIENCE: I've been inclined to minor depression all my life, and over years had good results with  Zoloft, Lexapro, Welbutrin, Prozac, among others.When my last episode started I (together with my shrink) decided to go natural and stick with SAM-e, and at 400 mg/ day, since the third week, I'm seeing results  comparable to that of aforementioned antidepressants.POSSIBLE ADDITIONS TO THE REGIMEN: Following my prev. shrink's advice, I also take 5-Htp, Tryptophan and DMAE on and off, but the effects have never been as dramatic as those of SAM-e or St. Johns. If you're fine with the extra expense, worth a shot, but keep your expectations minimal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39C3MA1MA3TVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002D150Y#wasThisHelpful","R39C3MA1MA3TVA","AA1ZYCEKJGG3A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA1ZYCEKJGG3A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a catalogue of casino rip-offs.  James Swain has been writing casino crime books for years, but none have this many scams in them.  Billy is a cheater.  A big time cheater with a crew.  He gets the tables turned on him and the fun begins.  He gets tied up in knots working for casinos and against them at the same time.  Every section of every chapter has him reliving or pulling another scam, so the reader gets a full education on ways casinos can be ripped off.  Billy tells all while in gaming agents custody, so the reader gets the current, immediate past and personal history.Billy is a fun roguish character.  Some of the other characters like the drug kingpin, casino manager and gaming agents are a bit stereotypical, but the fun in this book is learning the scams and watching a primo cheater get away with everything he sets his mind to.My criticism of the book is a mild one.  The descriptions of all the scams actually slows the book down so the plot develops very slowly. The last forty pages really pick up into a crescendo.I don't know if Mr. Swain can keep Billy fresh for another episode, but he left the door open at the end.

"This book might be better if all the characters are known to the reader.  I am not, so I felt as if I were an outsider.DuPre, a Metis in Montana is a problem solver.  From some references, he must have been some sort of official in the past, but he is now evidently retired.  His (step?) son goes to a sweat with another veteran of the Iraq war and the hear voices crying.  From the voices and a song, DuPre determines these are the voices of the souls of Metis killed in 1910.  The rest of the book is a rather slow search for the site of the massacre and graves.  Along the way, successor generations seem to be a tad over sensitive and try to block the search with violence and intimidation.  DuPre has, in additional to vast reserves of wisdom, very rich and well-connected friends.  That competition helps him to solve the mystery and put the souls to rest.I think if you know the characters and are invested in them, this book will mean a whole lot more to you.  As a stand alone, I found it lacking.  The writing is good and the characters are interesting, I just wish I had their background to understand them better.

"I've read and enjoyed all of the Duffy Dombrowski books.  I was a tad worried when i got this one.  i was afraid it would be filled with all the old ""I hate Claudia"" and ""I hate paperwork"" that was in the first four.  However, Mr. Schreck's writing continues to evolve and this book had much more depth than the prior ones.  The rote gimmick of the office politics was completely gone, while the mystery was just as good as always.  Duffy's relationships get full play - for good or for bad, as does his boxing career.The book opens with a high school age client of Duffy's telling him he's like to cut the throat of the football coach.  Yup.  Within a few pages, the coach's throat has been cut.  But this is not a typical clear the kid's name book.  There is much more going on and there is none of that.  The picture is too big for just one boy's possible crime.  Of course, Duffy gets into the middle of it.There is still good humor mixed in with the mystery.  Duffy is an excellent self-effacing narrator, but in this book, he shows a much less confident side.  Schreck has again turned out a good mystery with an excellent narrator in Duffy.  For followers of the series (this stands alone just fine) the fab four in AJ's again appears as does Al, the basset hound.  If you've enjoyed the prior books, you'll enjoy this one.  If this is your first, you will want to go back and read the others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14VWMRJIWT6LO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PMP265U#wasThisHelpful","R14VWMRJIWT6LO","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every fan of Sherlock Holmes worries when faced with a Sherlock adaptation.  I was somewhat mollified by the blurb that this one was sanctioned by the Doyle estate.  Mr. Horowitz does a great job.  In addition to being a homage to Sherlock and his unique skills, he creates a great mystery.  Both Sherlock and Moriarty are central players without, for the most part, being there.  There is also some humor in the Scotland Yard perspective of Sherlock.It appears that before his untimely death, Moriarty was approached by the Moriarty of America about joining forces in Britain.  A Pinkerton had been chasing the American mastermind and joined forces with a Scotland Yard investigator to find him.  After that, ""the game was afoot"".  Investigator Jones was embarrassed by Sherlock Holmes in a case that had been memorialized by Watson.  Since then, he had adopted Holmes' ways, so teh book included a good amount of deduction.This is a very good mystery.  It captures the flavor of Doyles' Holmes without giving the reader the feeling that it was a Sherlock rip-off.  Highly entertaining and - once again - I am given another reason to return to the original Sherlock.  This was a reminder of that excellence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAULQP9JNQ50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062377183#wasThisHelpful","R1LAULQP9JNQ50","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In several places the Winter Family (band of thugs) were described as sadistic lunatics.  That is apt.  Violent sadistic lunatics might be even more appropriate.  The novel tracks this band of violent criminal from Sherman's March where they are all introduced through different forms of violence, to Chicago where they employ violence to swing an election to Arizona where they use violence to try and exterminate the Apaches.  They all, of course meet a violent end.If you noted the gross overuse of the word ""violent"" in the opening paragraph, it is because this book is filled with violence.  It seems to be the only theme.  The characters are not developed except in the way the different means by which they cause pain and death on others.  The leader of the pack, Augustus Winter, is not developed at all, except he has the uncanny ability to make grown men cry by looking at them.  Oh, and he is violent.  Not the most violent, but very violent.A few of the characters also have the rare ability - beyond their ability to react to everything with violence - to philosophize on their grand views of life.I kept looking for some redeeming virtue in this book, but really couldn't find any except is done seem to have some historical background in the settings of Sherman's March to the Sea and late 19th century Chicago.  I am not a weak in the stomach reader, but the ever-present renditions of violence got tedious.

"This was a thoroughly enjoyable trip to the old west.  By the ""old west"", it means 1826 when civilization was essentially stopped at St. Louis and British and American trappers were trying to assert their country's land claims by trapping the heck of the land.  Mr. Burke uses very well researched trapping expeditions to set up his story of the friendships and love of his narrator, William Wyeth.  It is a rare blend of historical fiction and relationships.  Neither overwhelms the other.The characters have great variation.  There is the old typical trapper, the artist, the dandy trying to make good, thieves, gentlemen and, of course, a pretty woman.  They all have their reasons for going on a trapping expedition.  Wyeth wants to prove himself to his father, Landry wants to prove he is a better man than perceived, the artist wants to draw, they all want adventure, they all have the rambling bug.  The cast of characters are used well to draw the pictures of the times.  But this is not just a romance or feel good friendship novel.

"Hampton Sides can tell history like a story.  He captures the flavors of the times and the personalities of the participants in a unique way.  It makes for entertaining reading even of a detailed history such as this.The ""story"" is of one of the most notorious attempts to sail to the North Pole.  In the 19th century this was an unknown area of the world even less explored than the heart of Africa.  Bennett, the publisher of the New York Herald who had just sent Stanley to find Dr. Livingston, wanted another big story for his paper - like the first men to get to the Pole.  He sponsored the voyage of the U.S.S. Jeannette, a ""Navy"" boat and journey paid for by a private citizen.  Sides sets the journey off well by sharing with the reader the pulse of the times and desire for new exploration combined with the complete lack of knowledge of the North Pole.  Worse than the lack of knowledge were the surmising and assuming of the day's scholars.  Of course there was an open sea at the top of the world!The book plots the genesis of the journey and Captain DeLong's preparation, travel and travails.  At times it reads like thriller.  For me, who did not know the ending, the sense of foreboding was palpable.  I'd suggest if you don't know how the Jeannette fared, don't skip to the end.A fine piece of writing about a different time captured so well by Mr. Sides.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15L0VD4V1UGJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBZ3Z8U#wasThisHelpful","R15L0VD4V1UGJG","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you enjoyed THE AMBITIOUS CARD, the first in this series, you will enjoy this one even more.  There is the same humor, excellent main character, humor and a good plot.  Plenty of magic.  There are really no new elements, everything is just a bit better.  Most of the characters (the best ones, anyway) return, including Uncle Harry, Clive, Max and the Mystics.  Magic is prominent and Mr. Gaspard still employs the extremely frustrating but fun gimmick of almost revealing how trick are done and then falling back on the ""magicians never tell"" mantra.  He tells enough about the broad methodogy to give the reader a bit of education, though.In this book, Eli goes to his high school reunion, meets again his high school crush and performs a little magic.  The day after, the real ""fun"" begins.  A murder is committed while he sleeps.  He, of course, is brought in as a person of some interest by his ex and her new husband.  The mystery is a good one with murders piling on.  Eli falls back on magic to solve the crime and prevent an other.This is a fun novel that has all the elements: a good main character, an excellent supporting cast, depth and emotion in both, a good plot, good humor (without being overbearing) and an interesting background of magic.  Highly recommend for an enjoyable, warm romp of a mystery.  The book can stand alone just fine but, as is true with any series, is better read with the experience of the first just so you know the characters a bit better.  I'm looking forward to #3.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O243I89N8F0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N11OBX2#wasThisHelpful","R1O243I89N8F0J","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are elements of this book that are excellent, good, fair and poor.  To me, it is more like 2.5, but I could see how some night enjoy it.  The spy story is good, maybe fair.  The spy craft element is excellent. The characters are poor.  There is not a one that conjures any emotional response either for or against.  They are all completely void of personality and flavor. This gets especially difficult when combined with the writing style.  The book - every page - is filled with minute details of everything.  Some may enjoy this style.  The biggest problem I had with it is that the style did not contribute to the book.  It did not add to any tenseness.  It did not add depth to the character of the setting.  After I while, I found it tedious,  I also found myself skimming through entire paragraphs of descriptions because I knew they would not add to my enjoyment of the book.The detail and lack of investment in the characters (and, really the story, too) made the book plod for me.  You want good contemporary international intrigue and spying?  Go to I AM PILGRIM instead of this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WEHVHXCQTXVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316399833#wasThisHelpful","R2WEHVHXCQTXVZ","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this novel to be disjointed.  There are many elements coming from several directions.  They never really coalesce.  Suddenly the mystery is solved and the book is over.  To make it even more disjointed, every chapter heading has a time.  Unfortunately, they are all in different time zones, so, unless you have a map of meridians around, it is difficult to relate the actions taken place in Washington, Mali, Europe and other time zones.Judd Ryker is a professor who gets hired (purloined?) by the State Department.  Suddenly, without any real experience, he is put in charge of handling a coup in Mali.  He detects hat there are people in the State Department going in a different direction and that Defense also is going elsewhere.  Out of no where, he has an all powerful Special Forces guy carrying his water.  There are drugs, terrorism, counter-terrorism, lobbyists, diplomacy around the world and, well, your head just spins.  The prologue is no help.  We know from the prologue that a young American has also been kidnapped but, for most of the book, that is a non-factor.  Within the last fifteen pages we learn that Judd has figured it all out.  What we also learn is that Judd is even more naive than we thought throughout.There is a lot of good spy stuff out there.  This one is okay, but nothing great.  It might be better if you have an interest in Mali or Africa, but I doubt it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U28NEWGA3O92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399168605#wasThisHelpful","R2U28NEWGA3O92","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent mystery with an excellent cast.  Eli Marks is a magician who learned his craft from his uncle.  Part of his uncle's craft was debunking psychics and seers.  The book starts with Eli standing in for him.,  From there the murder mystery takes off.There are a few fundamentals about this book that make it truly enjoyable.  Eli solves the crime; but he is just a normal guy.  No supernatural powers.  He is a human character who is pining for his fine-looking landlord, who becomes a fine character in her right.  His uncle is also a fine character who misses his late wife. His ex-wife and her new husband are also good as are all the somewhat offbeat psychics.  In short (too late), all the characters are good and none are cardboard cut-outs.  Next, the book is constantly moving.  There are no slow parts.  THere is also some nice wry humor throughout.  Lastly, although Eli lives by the magician's creed to never divulge a trick, there is a lot about magic in this book.  It adds depth and color.This is an excellent mystery and a great start to a series.  I look forward to joining Eli again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMKQ2AQHXQQ05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELR0PDU#wasThisHelpful","RMKQ2AQHXQQ05","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago I read a book about how to read Literature.  One chapter entitled: ""Everything Comes from the Bible..."".  The next was entitled ""...Unless It Comes From Shakespeare"".  It seems these days that every mystery comes from the good auspices of an author's estate.  Robert Parker's Estate even has two authors allowed to write in his voice.  Mr. Goldsborough has been authorized to write in the voice of Rex Stout and continue the Nero Wolf stories.  I can't say I was a huge Stout-Wolf fan, but I have read several.  It seems to me that not only has Mr. Goldsborough captured Stout's voice, but he has crafted a darn good plot.  Frankly, it was better than a few of the Stout-Wolf books.Archie, always the hand-maiden star is featured in the book, is not only the eyes, ears and feet of Wolf, but in this book he is also the target of murder.  Someone wants to do him in to get at Wolf who, of course, never leaves the house.  In the meantime, a rich heiress becomes a client and Archie has to go in two directions while protecting himself from a murderer.Like Stout, Goldsborough captures New York City in its Upper Eastside well-off glory in the nineteen fifties.  This is a fine book, of whihc Mr. Stout, I am sure, would be pleased.  If you've never read Stout, don't worry.  This is a fine stand alone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7CFD1VVBBDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497690412#wasThisHelpful","R2U7CFD1VVBBDC","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a good solid start to a series.  Good enough that I've preordered the second book.  Jake and Laura are very good characters and their interactions add to the flavor and depth of the book.  The setting is 1932, right before FDR's inauguration.  Everyone knows Prohibition is on its last legs, but the Depression is overwhelming.  Their was dissatisfaction on both sides, but this book focuses on those who still have everything and might lose it.  An interesting perspective.Jake is a former private eye born and raised in Queens and NYC.  He fled to Florida a few years before the action starts.  He has turned into a writer of p.i. novels and returned to the Big City to meet with his publisher.  He goes to meet up with his old partner and all heck break loose.  Included in the heck breaking loose is the reunion with Laura, now a super-successful stage star engaged to a rich Gatsby type.  As you can tell by the subtitle, they end up teaming up.  This enriches the book as Jake is not quite a strong or unique enough character to carry the book alone.Perhaps the best part of the book are the cameos by real people of the age.  Mr. Murphy works them in with Jake and Laura flawlessly.The era is well-researched, the plot good, the writing good, but a tad bit of extra rumination throughout took it down a star.  Still a very good book and recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P9ENK2HPUKMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHMFANK#wasThisHelpful","R1P9ENK2HPUKMP","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The plot of this murder mystery is pretty good.  There are, however, two things that commend it beyond it's just pretty good plot - baseball and a familiarity with Providence, Rhode Island.  If either of those mean a lot to you, this novel is elevated to a five star.  That city is the setting and there are parts of the book that read like a newspaper account of a game - great for the baseball fans amongst us.Blissberg is an higher than average in intelligence Jewish professional baseball player with just above-average skills as a player. All of those assets make him different than the usual SortsCenter guest.  His roomie is found dead in the whirlpool and he can't let it go.  It leads him to intrigue that only really gets going in the last third of the book or so.  There is one particularly good action scene.  The baseball accounts are realistic.  Many of the supporting cast is also true-to-form, especially the ones closest to the team.  The author obviously knows the game, its players and its hanger-ons.A pretty good mystery made better by its setting.

"Good, solid fun mystery set in NYC during Prohibition.  Jimmy ""the Stick"", the main character is a darn good narrator/star.  He has humor, is a former runner for the mob and now runs a speakeasy.  He knows all the bad guys and the cops - for good or for all.  These books (this is the second) capture the Prohibition New York world well.  Jimmy ranges beyond New York as he retells stories that set up the present.And that is what takes this book from a five star to a four.  Jimmy tells so many stories setting up the present plot that occasionally the real plot gets lost.But this is a character driven story and Mr. Mayo draws excellent characters.  Every supporting actor is unique and brings a different personality.  Most are nuanced.  This was a time when there was honor among thieves.  Speakeasies, although technically illegal, were accepted and found in all the best places  - even in the new, chic Chrysler Building.  In such a setting where the lines of legality and morality are so blurred, so also should the characters blur those lines - and Mr. Mayo lets them do that in a way that really gives the book a good flavor.The book starts with seemingly everyone thinking that Jimmy has something and he does even know what it is they all think he might have.  everything they think he has is different.  What he finds he does has, no one seem to want.  From that confusion, murder and chases proliferate.  All may be set up by an old love interest.  Jimmy always has one going and one prospect front and center.This is a good, fun book with a great narrator and very good characters.  The time is captured well.  The weakest part is actually the plot; but when you get to watch and enjoy such characters, that becomes less a short-coming.  I look forward to the next book in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL8A7PFCEBFFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497662729#wasThisHelpful","RL8A7PFCEBFFY","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent introduction to a new interesting character.  The plot is not bad, but not great.  The back story of Jimmy ""the Stick"" is what makes it good.  Mr. Mayo captures the flavor of Prohibition mobsters and their world very well.Jimmy was a runner and shooting trainer for the mob.  He is now trying to go straight - sorta', kinda' - if running a speakeasy is going straight.  When the Lindbergh kidnapping happens, he's enlisted by an old friend to guard a baby in New Jersey.  From there the plot unfolds, but his personal history is the best part.This was a very very good introduction to this character.

"This is the best book I've read this year.  It started slowly, then grabbed me, then grabbed my heart and then wrapped itself around my heart like a soft muffler with a just a bit of burlap.  Despite that sappy description, this is by no means a sappy book.  It has warmth and humor.Ove is a taciturn, possibly grumpy, man set in his ways.  He finds a new need to confront the changing world and he does not like it.  He does like the change in his life, the people who force them or need to change.  Like his Saab, he wants life to go on reliably and unchanging.  He battles the changes and also fights battles that only he has been waging for years.This is a great character study of a very unique character.  The writing (or translation) sets a pace and tone that is perfect for a ""biography"" of this character.  Like his conversation, the writing is done in a cadence that fits the man, Ove.  There are other characters, but they are purely supportive; background to Ove.  They are there to highlight him and to draw the eyes to his sharp corners.With the warmth and humor there is also wisdom and some keen insights into human relationships.  It would make great fodder for a reading group - entertaining, but still with a lot to talk about.This is a very different book, perhaps because Ove is so different while still being perfectly believable.  We've all met people like him, if not to this degree.  This book is highly recommended.  By the end, you might even want to buy a Saab.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25I0LTU2LGYA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB730#wasThisHelpful","R25I0LTU2LGYA7","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the past, I have compared Mr. Giammatteo favorably to John Sandford.  That comparison continues and it was nice of him to throw in an accolade to Sandford in this book.  Frankie ""Bugs"" Donovan and Nicky ""Rat"" Fusco continue their lives in this novel.  That is what Giammatteo and Sandford do so well.  Their main characters (and supporting ones like Ace and Mazzetti) all have real lives where they age, develop, grow, win, lose, have relationships, lose relationships -well, you know, they have real lives.  In addition to watching the characters' lives, we also get an excellent plot.In this book, there is a serial murder on the lose and Donovan has the case with stand-bys Mazzetti and Miller helping him.  It is difficult to explain how and why Nicky gets involved without a spoiler, so suffice it to say that he does.There is an area where Giammatteo may actually pass Sandford.  That is the way he places his characters face moral dilemmas.  He puts Donovan and Nicky in morally compromising positions (for them) in a way that gives the books exceptional depth without crossing into maudlin or (worse) dullness.  This attribute adds to the tension of the murder investigation rather than slowing it down.  I have read all of Giammatteo's books, and this feature highlights the Friendship and Honor series better than the others.All three of these books have been great.  Were I to rate them, I would say this one is as good as the first with number two a have step down, though still a five star.  If you read this one first  -  it can stand alone - you will be unable to resist going back to the first two.  If you have a long weekend with nothing else to do, hunker down and read them in order.  A caution:  you'll be so wrapped up in them you'll have to remind yourself to eat.

"This is not a war book so much as an elephant book and that is a good thing.  The first three quarters or so is all about Williams, his relationships with elephants in the jungles of Burma and the elephants themselves.  It is an amazing account of amazing animals as seen through Williams' eyes, who was enamored with the giant animals at his first sight.Ms Croke weaves a story through the animal and human aspects while being informative about the colonial life of the Brits in Burma.  But most of all, it is about the elephants and their capacity to amaze those who do not work with them on a daily basis - which, assumedly, is every reader of the book.  Eventually World War II breaks in on Williams' iconic life and he saves the elephants from the abusive Japanese (who also want them) to use them extremely effectively in the Allied cause to retake Burma.This is an interesting and engaging book.  Any lover of animals will truly gain a much greater appreciation of elephants and appreciate a man like Williams who treated them like members of his family..","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1REWXTEHHZ2NF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXYLVU4#wasThisHelpful","R1REWXTEHHZ2NF","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this coming of age novel, the 14 year old ""Clever Trevor"" is brought to the mansion built by his ancestors in the Pacific Northwest.  He explores the cavernous manse through secret halls, chambers, rooms and floors.  There is discovers ghosts, accounts of his family's abuse, alcoholism, homosexuality, pillaging of the forest, conservationism and whatever other hot buttons that can be thought of as he lusts (somewhat naturally for a fourteen year old boy) for his aunt.  It seemed all the issues in this family were contrived.  Of course, he is there because his father is trying to forestall divorce from his mother; one more hot spot.Mr. Stein can certainly put phrases together into wonderful sentences.  Unfortunately, I found the book to be like Trevor's exploration.  It seemed as Mr. Stein was writing without really knowing where he was going, so he kept throwing in new and different rooms to be explored.

It is hard to tell what number this is as it seems to vary, but this one is not nearly as good.Alice and Snow have their detective agency and have gotten to be lovers as well.  It is hard to tell because the dialogue is so stilted and there seems to be a lack of rapport between the two.If the characters are not working well, you must rely on the mystery.  This one is mediocre at best.  The worst part is that Alice and Snow never figure anything out on their own.  The case is not solved by them at all.

"I'm an Ethan Gage fan and love the derring-do, swashbuckling action with the often tongue-in-cheek humor.  What made this series even better was the history lesson built into the yarn.  They are very reminiscent of the FLASHMAN series in all of those excellent respects.This one missed the mark for me.  Ethan (once again) is separated from his wife, the quasi-mystic from Eqypt, and is off after her.  She is after an automaton that can tell their futures.  They are not the only ones on this quest and thus the chase is on.  There is a great Napoleonic battle scene that is terrific for its historical base, action and Ethan's usual ""aplomb"".  Beyond that, the book is fairly repetitious.  It is told by Ethan and Asisza, his wife.  Her parts are very redundant and drag.Don't judge this series or Ethan Gage by this book.

"It is difficult to find the words to describe how good this book is.  It is a thriller unlike any other in that it is not only a great spy thriller, but also the saga of a deep undercover spy.  The spy (he has several names throughout) narrates the story and the reader sees what he sees, but also, since it is told as a retrospective, there are forebodings of errors and more darkness to come.The spy is an engaging character.  A super sleuth, he does not have the huge ego or extra special physical abilities of some characters in these types of books.The book takes the reader through America, Germany, Moscow, Turkey and the Middle East in what is obviously a well-researched book.  A fundamentalist wants to destroy Saudi Arabia by destroying its ""protector"", the USA.  His plot is ingenious.  Nothing in the book is unbelievable, which makes the very tight plot even more harrowing.The writing is excellent.  I cannot describe it as a ""page-turner"" because it is too cerebral to fly through.  The narrator takes the reader along through his thought processes.  Part of the book is not told in the first person.  Mr. Hayes tells the account of the terrorist in the third person, describing his motivations in an understandable way that puts the hairs on the back of your head stand up.  One can only imagination there are thousands of such thinkers in the Middle East today taking aim at the ""unbelievers.Here is, perhaps, the best compliment I can give this book.  I said the plot was tight.  This is amazing in a thriller a mere 607 pages long.  When I picked it up, I was leery that such a long book could hold my attention.  Not only did it hold me rapt, I yearned for more.  Unfortunately, it came to an end.  More unfortunately, it does not seem to set up a sequel.  This is a character I would follow like Bonds, Smiley and Reacher.Can't recommend this book highly enough.

"I'm a big fan of Mr. Benn's books, both those with and without Billy Boyle.  Every year I have looked forward to the newest Billy Boyle mystery.  I bought this one the day it came out.  Billy is a great character.  He started as an immature Boston cop, promoted there too young and rose in the Army too young.  We watched him mature, gain confidence and his intimidating boss, Major Harding, gain confidence in him.  Throughout he kept a sense of humor and bungled enough to be lovable without being a goof.The best part of these books were that they were historical novels that used a great engaging character with a decent crime mystery to tell the history of WWII.  Interesting, intriguing and informative - three big ""I's"".  I almost wished that that the war would go longer so there was more time for Billy to operate.This iteration of the series is an anomaly.  Billy has a stick...in him now.  He waxes philosophical about the big picture and depressive nature of war on too many occasions.  He is a know-it-all to young rookies in combat, which does not go with his personality.  There really is no central mystery until well past halfway through the book.  He and his pal, Kaz get sent to the British coast and wrap up a small mystery up in no time.  Then the book drags as Billy gets embroiled in the family mystery of the upper crust house of Sutcliffe and Pemberton where he and Kaz are staying.  Much of the book reads more like the screenplay for a PBS drama rather than a WWII historical novel.  Finally, a mystery tangentially tied to the military brings the household drama to an end.  There is a little history here, not nearly as much as usual.  The central theme was the family drama, which was not that interesting or unique, while the war lurked in the background. The drama was pretty standard fair.  Billy has lost his self-effacing sense of humor.  Two famous people have forced cameo appearances.Since I've loved and bought every one of Mr. Benn's books (he is also an interesting speaker), I will chalk this one up to a short slump and look forward to next September.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MHL117E4QCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IW4DP7G#wasThisHelpful","R11MHL117E4QCS","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Early in the book, it is said that veterinary practice is no longer that of James Herriot.  This book shows that there is still a lot of that going on - only this time with a socially stilted nerd of a vet.  The set up is typical, yet good.  The vet returns to his small Vermont backwoods hometown to take over his father's failing practice.  He is falling in love with a woman he can't figure out.  So far, it is all pretty darn pat.  However, Mr. Trout rises above the typical and the predictable introducing interesting characters and situations.  There are nerds, hacking, strange pets, strange pet owners and things that seem as if they would be cardboard cut-outs, but they are not,  They are unique and have a distinctive and endearing quirkiness.  The vet's super-nerdy diagnoses are worth the price of admission.The book started a tad slowly, but picked up.  This is four stars for the reason that you would have had to read the first book (PATRON SAINT) to fully appreciate some of the background.  I, regrettably, did not and so I felt a bit out in the wilderness.  Even with that caveat - read the first book first - this was a thoroughly enjoyable warm feel good book with some good vet stuff thrown in to the mix.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FOH2HB5O8N90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXTSU3S#wasThisHelpful","R1FOH2HB5O8N90","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is clear Mr. McIntyre loves his topic.  He was as enthusiastic about the secret project ""Operation Mincemeat"" as were its creators.  You can tell by all the detail (sometimes a bit much) and the all the background information he provided on every character.The operation itself drives the book.  Mr. MacIntyre takes it from its genesis as a concept, to its inception, through its tortuous set-up, the operation itself and its aftermath.  It is the aftermath and the effect on the Germans that is really most astounding.  To make a clandestine operation work is one thing.  To have it effect, truly, the outcome of a war as large as WWII is absolutely amazing.I have read of this operation in other books, fiction and non-fiction, but this is the complete story.  It even includes the gaffes and errors that could have (and perhaps should have) scuttled the entirety.This is a good book about an incredible story.  My only criticisms is that, at times, the detail was too much and, if you are familiar with WWII, some of the background information was pretty basic.

"This book was atrociously translated.  At first it was amusing with gems like: ""My brain interpreted it to be the coroner"" and in the midst of passion ""she tried to detain herself"".  As it went on it became obnoxious with, on several occasions, words used meant the opposite of the author's presumed intent being used.  The author at one point ""fast paced"" across the runway to get top a ""grey leathered chair"".  Syntax was not English and the author tried to use every adjective in his Greek-English dictionary and even some I had not thought of, like the ""graphic blue and white houses"".The book was also amateurishly written with pained attempts to describe Greece and its culture inserted regardless of flow or context.  The deliciousness of food being described in the midst of a grisly murder investigation?The plot is pretty good for a serial killer and had a good theme.  The end was amazingly childish that evoked a ""Really?  I read this much for that?""  For Nickelodeon it might have been clever.All-in-all, this is a book to skip.  AN editor would have helped.

"If you're wondering how a book could be written about one man who stole a bunch of maps, the answer is to add lots of history.  That is what Mr. Blanding did and it is not a bad thing.  If you are a lover of maps, this is the book for you.  It is more about maps than true crime - which is not a bad thing.W. Forbes Smiley is one of several map thieves in the last decades.  He differs from the others by his brazenness, the fact that he was a respected map dealer and that he was/is such a colorful and flamboyant figure.  His methods were not much different from those who went before (or will follow).  That is why the addition of so much history, both of maps and related to amp and mapping make this book interesting.Truly for lovers of maps, this is an interesting account of the history of mapping (particularly of North America) and one's man's downfall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15RIHRQN54LFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L6LNU#wasThisHelpful","R15RIHRQN54LFI","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know hockey and am a mild fan, but I don't think even a great fan would love this book.  The main character, Brad Shade, is a former player for the LA Kings who is now scouting.  Hockey is in the background (with random yarns of other former players thrown in randomly), but is not a major theme.  The mystery is just ok. There is very little ""investigation"" besides the theft of a diary.  There is lots of driving and fights, seemingly without cause.  Brad brings another player along (Chief) and his only purpose seems to be to win the fights and be put out of his way by Brad.The best character is the murder victim who is found dead in the first few pages.  Unfortunately, he does not say much.  Brad Shade is a character I just could not figure out.  On the one hand he tries to be the hard-oiled P.I.  On the other, he philosophizes unmercifully.  He doesn't want to be a womanizer, but beds 'em easily.  This is in the first person and Brad drones.My biggest criticism of the book - which I enjoyed for more than the first half - is that it really dragged towards the end.  It came to a resounding halt with about thirty pages to go.  Then, of course, it wrapped up in two with a fairly unsatisfying ending.There are great mystery writers out there.  Too many good ones to spend time on this mediocre one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T1ZU6R5YSMGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143188712#wasThisHelpful","R2T1ZU6R5YSMGW","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there were a Mt. Rushmore of current mystery/thriller writers, Michael Koryta would have to be on it.  This is just one more example of why.  Koryta never follows a formula in his thrillers.  This one is set in the wilds of Montana in a survival school.  A boy is a witness to a crime and must be protected, so he is sent to Montana from suburban Indiana.  Thus begins the wild the search and flee.There are a lot of twists and turns.  Reviewers of this book have criticized it for some of these turns.  Hellooo.  This is thriller fiction.  None of the twists were predictable, which I find to be one of the measures of good escape fiction.  Another good measure is the uniqueness of the setting.  Here we have a survival school with fire.  The reader gets an education is interesting aspects of both.Perhaps the best feature of the book are the bad guys.  They are absolutely chilling and unlike any I've encountered.  Their dialogue will stand the hairs on the back of your neck straight up.Like most Koryta's books, the emotional and psychological toll on the characters are a major element.  No one, good or bad, gets off easy.This is a thrilling ride through the mountains of Montana with chills and heat - literally and figuratively.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGFTM8C6CV5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPQA76Q#wasThisHelpful","RWGFTM8C6CV5J","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This will teach me to look at the publisher on these discount books.  You would think that even self-publishers would get an editor, but Mr. Wallace clearly did not.  The pacing is flawed.  The story inconsistent, varying from romance novel to graphic violence, WWII war story to a story that could fit anywhere.  There is obviously good research here with some very nice historical references.  These are about the only things that place the story in WWII as apart from an y other occupied territory.  Nothing much atall happens in the first 80%, then it all comes flowing downhill like river rapids in a flood. I found the characters incongruous.  Except for the cardboard cutouts of the gestapo officer and the rich do-gooder, none had any consistent development.Frankly, I am at a loss for all the rave reviews.  Sorry.  I found myself skimming to get through this way too early and then was disappointed in the ending.  The first twenty pages held so much promise, but from there nothing happened and when things started to happen they were rushed and implausible.  Let's just drive across occupied France shall we?  Twice?  Why not?I was very disappointed in this book.  Bottom line, it was amateurish and not worth the time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34LK3JVFBN7MV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004U2USMY#wasThisHelpful","R34LK3JVFBN7MV","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a throwback to the great Cold War novels.  It is just plain terrific.  Spell-binding with real characters playing their roles to a tee in this novel.  There has been some criticism that the main character, a 19 year old ""negro"" student was not the proper vehicle for the role she played.  There may be validity to that.  On the other hand this was secret stuff and who better to fool the other side.Mr. Carter captures well the fear and anguish around the world during those those days in October of the Cuban missile crisis.  Better, he captures the historic context of the two super powers' real positions as well their perceived positions.  He placed well the various factions on both sides who advocated for their positions from positions of both personal self-interest and national self-interest.All the characters were well developed and believable.  Sure, the 19 year old may have been a wonder child, but she was still a good vehicle to get the story told.  Mr. Carter's historical note wraps up the fictionalization nicely.  His writing in the body keeps the tension rising throughout.This is a highly entertaining and thought-provoking old-fashioned (in a good way) spy novel.  It harkens to the early (and great) LeCarre days.  Highly recommended for readers of espionage, historical fiction and people who just plain enjoy a very good book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRW5WJ3OLGEHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385349602#wasThisHelpful","RRW5WJ3OLGEHJ","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was never sure exactly what this book was.  I'm not sure Mr. Lashner was that sure either.  There are murders.  There is, of course, his fine main character, Victor Carl, and there is also politics in the form of bagmen and their corruption.  Often, I felt as if this book were Mr. Lashner's personal screed on politics rather than a murder mystery of any sort.  Carl waxes philosophically on virtually everything, at times sounding the know-it-all, but there is a special venomous cynicism with any political.  That is understandable in this day and age and all of America's frustrations seem to be unleashed in his diatribes.  But, I guess I came for a more entertaining mystery.The mystery itself is pretty good, but it eventually gets wrapped into the ""everyone associated with politics is scum motif"".  It rambled on slowly twisting and turning to indict as many participants as possible.  I would not call this a ""taut"" mystery at all.  I found myself rooting for its end more than its resolution.I've enjoyed other Victor Carl, but this one missed for me.  Too much negativity and cynicism.  I can watch the world news tonight for that.  Call me shallow, I did not find this entertaining.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UH4LB4401X5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477822836#wasThisHelpful","R1UH4LB4401X5P","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ahh the temptresses!  Three out of four, anyway.  This is an interesting and very in depth look at four woman who served as spies during the Civil War.  Two were for the north and two the south.  One, Emma, was a female who posed as a male soldier for the first years of the war.  Her spying was limited, but her story was, nevertheless, interesting.  The fact she was one of many such poseurs made her yarn even more interesting.Ms Abbott follows the women's triumphs and failures chronologically in a fashion that was easy to follow even as she switched from participant to participant.I have two criticisms of the book that do not overshadow its merit.  There was a lot of detail I found uninteresting that did not enhance the book for me.  Details like the colors of the wall, outfits, clothing and the like.  There were also times when Ms Abbott seemed to infuse her imagination as to the the thoughts and feelings of the participants.  Although the author's note said everything came from diaries, I doubt that was the case in all instances.  For instance, she included sensations felt while drowning - - doubtful that came from the diary of the deceased.All that easily put aside, this was an interesting account of Civil War spying, the way the men of the war found it difficult to fully deal with female combatants and spies.  The author did a fine job of putting it all in context of the war itself, inserting just enough background to appreciate the pressures being felt on both sides.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0P4N2135QYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062092898#wasThisHelpful","R1K0P4N2135QYA","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Slog.  The Pacific northwest is wet and it often requires slogging through thick mud without any redeeming quality - sort of like trying to read this book.  Set in a logging and harbor town in the last quarter of the nineteenth century the author treats the readers to an exhibition of his use of a thesaurus.  There is very little story.  Like the aforementioned mud, none of the characters have any redeeming qualities -- if you can get through all the superfluous words and verbiage to try and figure them or the plot out.  I do not enjoy having to decipher my books.  I like to read them.The story, such as it is, is told partially in the first person by several of the character.  There is no rhyme or reason as to when it is in the first or third person.  The first person narratives are told by a woman, a street criminal, a ne'er do well drunk fraudulent husband and an eleven year old.  They all read exactly the same!  You'll get a kick out of the observations and metaphors cast about by the eleven year old.  You will also be amazed at how rape and graphic sex scenes read in high-falutin' language.I couldn't get through this book and regretted the time I wasted trying.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HW8DEJOH42ZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062297740#wasThisHelpful","R1HW8DEJOH42ZP","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book had so much promise.  The reader learns that a bartender who seemed to be a loser has a lot more to offer and a past that had more depth.  This ""coming out"" is caused by his adopting a dog.  This is not a feel good dog book, Rocco only seems to bring him out a bit.  As Bob progresses, the pasts and present of other characters come to light.  Their lives intersect with Bob's either directly or in rumor and innuendo.  All that is great.  Add a conspiracy and a robbery of a mob-connected bar, and all the ingredients are there for a terrific book with depth of characters.Unfortunately, the book is over way too quickly.  Suddenly, in a clap of thunder, all the loose ends come together in a very unsatisfying way.  This is a short book.  Unfortunately, it is disproportionate.  The first half is dense, deep and thought-provoking.  The ending is quick and easy.The best asset of this book makes it worth reading.  That asset is Mr. Lehane's writing.  There were several times that I went back and read a passage again just to savor it.

"Harlan Coben is one of the best mystery writers writing today.  For that reason, he is held to a higher standard.  This is a very high standard and MISSING YOU does not approach his best works.It is a very good mystery and his main character, Kat Donovan, is a NYC with a haunting past.

"I'm a huge fan of Mr. Giammatteo and have read all his novels. m This one fell short of the others.  It is the second starring Connie, the ""niece"" of a NYC mobster who becomes a cop and moves to Houston.  In this iteration, she is again set up against Cortes, the Mexican drug kingpin who almost killed her in the first book.This book is good, but not great.  Giammatteo's books have the quality of deep emotions and moral dilemmas confronted by the characters.  This one has some elements of that, but not to the depth of others.  They seemed mere after-thoughts rather than themes.  The ending is a bit a predictable, particularly if one analyzes the title.Ok, that is the bad news.  The good news is that the plot is, as usual a good one.  The characters are developed and not stereotypical.  The dialogue is realistic and, at times, amusing.  The killer is a great character from whom I wanted even more.  SO I should have tempered my criticism.  This is still a good mystery.

"The subtitle reads ""The Kremlin, the CIA...""  If you are expecting something with spies or significant intelligence intervention by reading this subtitle, you will be disappointment.  There might be fifteen pages devoted to the CIA's publication of a Russian language version of DR. ZHIVAGO and the places they handed it to people going into the Soviet Union.  The rest of the book is a detailed biography of Pasternak after he finished the books.  There are hundreds of quotes from those for him and against him.  For every conference, at least three or four speakers are quoted.  If you are a Pasternak fan and want a blow-by-blow account of how the Soviet government handled him after he wrote the novel, this might be a four or five star book.  If you are looking for something about the cold war and our propaganda efforts, this will be a one or two star book.  Thus my three star rating. I'm in the latter class so I found myself skimming paragraphs and pages that all read essentially the same after the first hundred pages.  Once the Soviet government read the novel and decided it was not to be published, they had all their yesmen and authors who wanted to be publish pillory him.  Somehow (it is never explained why) Pasternak was never imprisoned and they stopped short of exile so he would not get more publicity.  The west pushed the book.  The Soviets suppressed it.  That's the book in a nutshell.Unless you are passionate about Pasternak, skip this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ISKQWR4UJ13P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307908003#wasThisHelpful","R2ISKQWR4UJ13P","A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RMHZSWZ7ZEQO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you ever played the game Snakes and Ladders, then you know the concept behind this game.  The object of the game is to get to the top of the board.  To do that, you roll a die, and move the number of spaces that are on the die.  If you land on a ladder, you climb higher up the board.  If you land on the head of a snake, you get pushed back down the board.The graphics are cute, which is why the app earns three stars, but the game involves absolutely no skill, whatsoever.  You just press on the die to take your turn, and then press on the die for the robot to take its turn.  The results are completely random. The second version (included) where the snakes and ladders move around the board is a bit more interesting than the version in which they stay in one spot.  Nothing other than luck is involved.  You go up and down the board.  You can press the die very quickly, so the game ends very quickly.Adults will probably find this app rather pointless. Very young children will probably enjoy watching the icons ""climbing"" the ladders and ""sliding"" down the snakes funny for a few minutes.  Ultimately, however, even young players will realize that no skill is involved, get bored, and move on to something more interesting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLHH5M0JX0O36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B4K94U2#wasThisHelpful","RLHH5M0JX0O36","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The IDEA of matching butterfly tiles seemed great the surface, but the photos of the game made me feel like something was off. I couldn't put my finger on why it seemed off, but it just didn't feel right.Today, the app was the Free app of the Day, so excitedly downloaded it.  Right away, I noted the pictures and just too similar in design and in colors for a matching game based on speed.  Additionally, there is just too much going on in each square, making it difficult to quickly focus in on one feature and recognize a match.  And why on Earth would the app designer crowd three butterflies into one cube panel?  The effect changes busy squares into disasters because you want to play quickly, but your brain doesn't want to process that much information so quickly.  And there's a huge issue with the butterflies.  There are thousands of beautiful butterflies in nature, but the ones in this app just don't have the beauty of the real ones.  Ironically, the backgrounds are more colorful than the butterflies.The music is lovely, and you can individually adjust the volume of the music and the volume of the flapping wing sound.  It is fun to watch the butterflies burst out across the screen and fly away when you make a match.  The user has a lot of control of the display of the cube, and can rotate it so that you can seen only one side at a time (flat), or more than one side (with a 3-D effect), so you can adjust the display to your own advantage.  But these features are common to all of the apps in this series.The ""iestry"" series is full of wonderful versions, but this one is not one of my favorites.  It's fine since I got it for free, but I'm glad I didn't pay for it!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLJ4QJZNU514J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4FVE5S#wasThisHelpful","RLJ4QJZNU514J","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine you are a bird capable of flying, but only sideways.  Now imagine you can move upwards in the sky (with difficulty), but only if a helpful human (the player at the controls)  helps to give you some lift.  Now imagine you are trying to fly up a narrow shaft with ""obstacles"" poking out from the side walls of the shaft you're attempting to climb, and the obstacles are randomly spaced out.  The obstacles, by the way, are pointed - and they have eyes!  Awk!  It turns out the obstacles are other birds, trying to take a bite out of you!  Yes, it's a Bird Eat Bird world in this game.  As your human helps you climb the shaft, you work as a team to try to collect diamonds.  If you human doesn't continue to tap the screen to move you upwards, you will fall back down the shaft, towards the bottom.  Like a balloon, however, you fall rather slowly back towards the ground, as you continue to move sideways.  Trying to adjust your trajectory can be challenging.  Oh, and there isn't anywhere to rest, so you have to keep flying.  As you might imagine, with those conditions, this game is tricky.  But's it's wickedly tricky, and loads of fun!I've deducted a star because, when I was trying to learn the controls, I was directed to a screen, asking me if I wanted to purchase some help.  I couldn't exit from that screen, and had to shut down my Kindle to escape.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36DXFHHZ2FGAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZUJEL8I#wasThisHelpful","R36DXFHHZ2FGAM","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an American, blackcurrent was not a flavor familiar to me; however, I thought it looked interesting, so I tried it.  The first glass tasted a little odd, but not terrible.  I had the syrup, so I decided to give it another try.  It tasted better every time I sipped it.  By the end of the fourth bottle, blackcurrent had become a flavor I liked.

"The art in this version of ""Hidden Object"" is very beautiful.  It is amazing how the objects blend into the drawing, and trick the eye!  Sometimes it's hard to notice the object because it looks like it belongs in the photo.There are multiple ways to play the game.  You can compete with the clock, or you can take as much time as you want.  You can choose to search for objects via words, silhouettes, pictures, or have the computer mix up the options, randomly.  And you get to play the bonus round with whatever time you have left over after you've found the original set of objects.  The objects are rotated sometimes, and the small details sometimes make it hard to see the match.It's not as easy as you might suspect it will be to locate the hidden objects.  Each picture contains many more objects than you need to locate, and the objects that are included sometimes carry over from one picture to another.  Additionally, some of the objects look similar to the one you're looking for, so don't touch the screen too quickly or you may hit the wrong one.  Consequently, if you play multiple rounds of the game, you may be shocked when an object is not where you remembered seeing it.  These challenges make the game very fun.One star has been deducted from the rating because of a flaw in the design.  While you're searching for the objects, you can zoom in or out by pinching your fingers together on the screen, or by spreading them out.  Unfortunately, when you are zooming in or out, if you happen to touch an object while you're attempting to zoom in our out, points will be deducted from your score.  It's annoying when you have points deducted for placing your fingers on the wrong part of the screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX1AUXV35OA19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYCIS3G#wasThisHelpful","RX1AUXV35OA19","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an wonderful, high-quality summer sweater.  At work, I am very close to an air conditioning vent, so I'm always cold indoors. When I saw the picture of the sweater, the textured pattern made me worry it would be too thick and too warm to wear during the summer.  Since it was on sale, and I loved the beautiful pattern, I decided to take a chance and order it, figuring I could always wear it during the winter if it was too warm for the summer.  I bought a black one, which will match just about anything,  The color is rich. and it looks equally good buttoned all the way up or partially buttoned up,either from the top or the bottom.

"This playlist contains a nice variety of popular music, with most major styles of music represented within the collection.

"This charger is a nice replacement for the charger that originally came with my 2nd generation Kindle Fire.  After a couple of years, the original charger would not seat correctly in the charging slot on the device.  When I saw this charger, I was willing to give it a try, even though it was not a Kindle-specific item.  Luckily, it works!  Now I can charge up either of my Kindle Fire (2nd and 3rd generations).The best feature of this charger is its portability.  Since the prongs recess into the charger and don't stick out, you don't risk damaging them in transit.  Now I can throw it into my purse and head out the door.  I only wish the cord were a little longer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROU94YI9XPCB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001W1TZTS#wasThisHelpful","ROU94YI9XPCB5","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 7D Train is absolutely delightful and a lot of fun! The app (version 1.5) works perfectly on my device, a Kindle Fire 3rd Generation.  I can see all of the beautiful illustrations, and even the gems.  Other reviewers have written they cannot make the app work properly on their Kindle; however, the reviewers did not explain what version of the Kindle they were using, or what version of the app they tried.  I almost didn't buy this app because of that comment, but figured I'd give it a try, and if it didn't work, I'd return it to Amazon for a refund.  But that wasn't necessary.This app is a feast for your eyes and ears.  The graphics are bright and colorful, and the details in the illustrations are incredible.  The backgrounds are frequently hilarious (there is a Loch Ness unicorn, for example), and the details are fantastic. The humor will appeal to all ages, and there are things adults will find funny that will go over the heads of the little ones.  The music is hyper-charged to match the pace of the mine cars as they go zipping through the mine, and the tempo helps to keep your reflexes on call so you can more readily beat the challenges.  Each dwarf's personality is developed nicely, and the dwarfs make character-appropriate comments as they experience their rocketing ride through the mine.  Some of the comments they make are hysterical!You get a lot of fun features with the basic package, and you do not need to purchase anything else to have fun.  If you want to ratchet it up a notch, you can purchase addition gadgets and consumables in the mine's shop.  There are also packages listed.  The purchase options get better - and more expensive, of course - as you complete challenges along the way.  With the prices, I think the company store owns the shop. ;)  If you don't like the basic cart, you can upgrade it.  Each dwarf's cart can be upgraded twice.You can't just memorize the hazards, either.  While some of the hazards and trophies are positioned in the same location for each run, others move around the screen.  For example, one of the dwarfs was sitting in a car on the top rail on one pass, and on the next pass, he was sitting in a car on the bottom rail.  That means you have to pay attention, and play the screen that is presented rather than the one you memorized. It's all fun, and it just adds to the challenge!  :)The game starts off with a menu screen.  From the main menu, you get to select which one of the seven dwarfs you want to drive through the mine.  Don't feel like the other dwarfs will be left out of the round because the other six dwarfs are sitting in cars along the tracks, and you can hook them up to your car as you speed along (if you have quick reactions).  You'll get a special treat if you manage to hook them all up into one train.  Plus, if you have one of them hooked on, and you make a mistake and fall off of the track, the extra car will fall off, but the main car will survive and proceed down the track.  Each dwarf has a special talent, and you can use it by tapping on the lightening bolt icon. Once used, it needs to refill before it can be used again.From the main menu, you can hit the television icon, and a little story will play to let you learn about the personality of the dwarf you are choosing to guide through the mine.  Some of the comments are very funny!  You can also access the shop and see the trophies you have earned.  As always, some of the trophies are easier to earn than others.  You are also shown an icon with a clip board, which lists the missions you can complete to earn additional gems; the gems can be used in the store to purchase gadgets and [power] boosts (also known as consumables).  You will also receive gems when you end a round by running your mine cart off of the track.  Depending on how well you play, the gems can add up quickly.There is an ""adults only"" icon on the mail menu.  From there, you can sign up on the Disney site to receive special offers and learn about new app releases.  From that screen, I learned there is a new series about the 7D planned for release in July 2015.  (I suppose that makes this app a promo.)  I was also able to access the settings (music, sound effects and voices), the credits, an e-mail icon for the developers, and instructions from the adults only menu.  The game starts off with a tutorial, but play is extremely intuitive, and you really don't need instructions when you first start.  It isn't until later, when you get better, and want to maximize your playing powers, that the instruction are helpful.  I'm not sure why the instructions are buried on the adults only screen, but they are worth reading.  You can also reset the tutorials from the settings screen, so each player can be given their own tutorial..All in all, this is one of the better apps I've seen, and I'm glad I paid for it.  Note that I am not a professional reviewer; I just stumbled across this app and thought it was fantastic.  If you decide to play, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OJF3A4JWV05V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2S00A0#wasThisHelpful","R2OJF3A4JWV05V","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been searching for this game as an app for several years now.  So I was elated when my periodic search actually produced a result that looked like it might be the game I longed for.  It was one of my favorite games when I lived in the upper Midwest, it seems most people in other regions of the USA just don't know about it.  (Too bad, since it's a great game.)  To keep my skills sharp, I thought it would be nice to play the game against the computer.BUT....  After playing it, I couldn't help thinking that it was a good start, but it sure does need a lot of work.  First, the bidding is a bit strange.  In the rule book I'm familiar with, a six is only an opening bid.  You don't ever actually play a hand with a six bid, but in this game, you do.  Next, there are only three cards in the blind instead of five, so all of the strategies that took years to develop quickly went flying out the window.Okay, so it's just a different version of the game.  Thinking I might have to refer to the instructions for this version and learn to adjust, I started looking for them, but this game doesn't have any instructions.  :(  Then, when I got a perfect nil hand, I couldn't figure out how to bid nil!  Instructions would have been very, very nice, especially when I later looked it up, and discovered that the reference to ""misare,"" on the bid screen is a nil bid.  (Who knew there were so many version of 500!)One of the best features of the game is the quick card play.  You tap on the card you want to play, and viola! It is done.  It IS the basic game I'm familiar with, but I'd like to see options for selecting a different version, and instructions.  So, it's a good start, but it's not ready for a full launch yet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R207FMYO00JMLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRJ379C#wasThisHelpful","R207FMYO00JMLV","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent game.  Amy is the little girl who cheers you on and encourages you as you play.  She is a toy maker, and she needs parts to make toys.  You have goals for the number of blocks, per color, that need to be obtained to clear the level and advance in the game.  Although this is a color-matching game, there are a lot of twists to the standard matching game.  The goals vary by the number of each color you need to finish the level to making the required matches within the time given.  There are also a number of special tools you can earn by playing well, and the tools get better as the number of blocks you color-match at one time increases.

"Lost Bubble is a fun game, and the graphics are very good.  It's an easy game to learn; but it's also challenging because new features with more difficult challenges are added as you work your way up through the levels, so you don't get bored.The reason I rated this game with four stars instead of five stars is that you have to pay real money to access most of the ""tools"" (gems) that grant the player new abilities and that make playing the game more fun.  I certainly don't mind paying to purchase a game I enjoy, but I don't want to have to keep paying to keep playing.  And the amounts changed are excessive.  The other day, for example, I received a pop--up message with an offer of 40% off the normal price.  The package could be purchased for $25.99.  I thought about it, and realized that I would quickly run through the supply purchased through this offer.  Then I realized purchasing the offer was the equivalent of renting the game for a few hours.  The manufacturer should forget their ""pay for the gems and coins as you go method,"" (or at the very least, lower the price to something reasonable) and just allow people to purchase the game outright.  Also, you should be able to earn the opportunity to purchase the items that will help you rather than requiring the player to purchase them.This game is fun, but if you want it to be more fun, you'll need a lot of cash,","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RMHAYGR7PFI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFTHXMC#wasThisHelpful","R3RMHAYGR7PFI1","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It took a while to get the necklace, but it was shipped from China.  Right out of the envelop, I was impressed by this necklace.  What impressed me most was the relative accuracy of the land masses on the globe.  Additionally, the globe is tilted on the axis at an angle that appears to be relatively correct.  The globe is a solid mass, and it is about as heavy as a shooter marble.  The colors are nice, too, with the blue for the ocean and the gold for the land. (China is outlined, so I suspect this necklace was originally manufactured for Chinese consumers.)Although this necklace is very cute, the quality just isn't there.  The first time I wore it, the chain came apart and the globe fell to the floor. When that happened, I examined it a little more closely, and discovered that joint between the two halves of the globe were not aligned correctly.  I put it back together, but it came apart again, the globe fell out and rolled away.  The globe rotates almost completely around, but the misaligned part gets stuck and prevents the globe from spinning around completely.  So I thought I'd try to correct that, and is was able to bend the metal with my fingers.  I didn't really expect all that much for the price, but it would have been nice if it lasted longer than one day.UPDATE: 2/1/2013I sent an e-mail to the company, notifying them of the quality issues, and received an automated message in reply.  The message said the office was closed to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and asked not to post a negative review until they had a chance to make things right.  So I will post an update if they correct the problem.  It's possible this was just a defective product in the batch.  We'll see.  Until then, it remains to be seen what they will do, and I do not recommend this product.UPDATE:  2/12/14 The seller contacted me, and we are communicating.UPDATE: 2/17/2014  The seller is shipping a new necklace to replace the defective product.  I will post an update when the replacement is received.UPDATE: 3/16/2014  The replacement necklace finally arrived, with the globe inserted into the necklace upside down. :) This necklace isn't as bad as the other one, and it hasn't fallen apart this time. The two halves are still not aligned correctly, but it's not as bad as it was before.  It's very pretty, but it's not great quality. Overall, this necklace is only so-so.

"The fit of this robe was odd.  In some ways, it was too large, and in other ways, it was too big.  There was too much fabric in the upper part of the robe, and I couldn't seem to pull the robe tightly even around my waist.  The length, however, was so short that it hiked up way too high, even when wearing the matching pj bottoms.  I expected it to be short, from the picture, but I didn't expect to feel like I was wearing a button-down shirt instead of a robe.  The long sleeves were the perfect length.  The fabric is warm soft and warm, but there isn't enough of it.Goldilocks wouldn't even like the way this robe fit me.

"The 2014 version of the Grammy Nominees is a solid album.  There are a lot of stand-out songs in this collection. ""Brave,"" for example, is brilliant, and it has a powerful social message, too.  This year's collection includes some selections that are edgier and riskier than songs included in previous collections.  With great risks, the highs can be higher than normal (""Just Give Me a Reason""), but the lows can be lower than normal (""Retrograde"").The songs selected for this CD seemed to represent the different types of music more equally this year than has been the case in the past; previous collections have been more heavily weighted towards the pop charts than those selected this year.  The collection also included multiple examples of blended genres (""Highway Don't Care"" - country, pop and classic rock, for example), following a growing trend in the music industry.A short overview of each song follows.""Locked Out of Heaven,"" has a 1980's style introduction, and segues into a more modern dance song though the use of sound effects.  The song is full of sexual innuendo, and some people (but not me) may consider the lyrics sacrilegious.  ***WINNER - Best Pop Album, ""Unorthodox Jukebox""***""Blurred Lines,"" blends reggae with a 1970's disco beat and current day lingo, and then throws in some rap for good measure.  The topic covered here is sexual fantasies about a good girl.  The more explicit aspects of the lyrics have been glossed over, giving this song a bit of a blurry effect.In ""Royals,"" the singers reject the materialism of everyday society.  They ( aren't into money or status symbols, and the music cleverly reflects that message.  It's very creative. ***WINNER - Best Pop Solo***WINNER - Song of the Year***""Radioactive"" stats off in a peaceful manner, and the music changes dramatically when the singer wakes up to discover a nuclear bomb has gone off.  From the time the singer wakes up, the beat is heavy, and the tempo is slow.  The background music during the song sounds shaky, like a radio transmission being disrupted by interfering static.  The gasping breath, in and then out adds an artistic touch.""Get Lucky"" is a good electronica dance song.  The lyrics are sparse and could be interpreted as having a double meaning, the most obvious of the two meanings being the one with the sexual overtones.  ***WINNER - Best Pop/Duo Group*** WINNER - Record of the Year""*** ***Winner - Album of the Year***""Roar"" is a fun pop song.  I love the use of Mohammad Ali's, ""Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,"" which was very appropriate to the message of the song.""Mirrors"" is a nice, slow pop love song.  Justin Timberlake demonstrates his potential as a songwriter, making me wonder what he'll be writing in ten years.""Brave,"" is a soft pop song, with an important message about the power of standing up for yourself.  Sara Bareilles has an terrific voice that is powerful and full of emotion. Wow!""Same Love,"" starts with a simple piano introduction.  Profound words of acceptance are voiced over the piano lines in this rap song.  Mary Lambert sings each chorus, explaining that she is who she is, and that she loves her girlfriend.  The song fades out with a Biblical reference and a soft piano.  ***WINNER Best New Artist, Macklemore & Lewis***""Retrograde,"" with its heavy dissonance sounds is one of the riskier songs in the collection.  Do you like the sound of a balloon, when the air is being allowed to slowly escape from the value?  No?  Well, I don't like this song because the instrumentals sound like that squealing balloon to me.  They just make me cringe.  It's a funeral dirge that gasped its last breath and then somebody jumped up and down on it, trying to squeeze the last bit of air out of its lungs.  You get the point.  To be fair, James Blake sounds like he has a nice voice, but the quality of it is inconsistent in this song.""Swimming Pools"" is an original song, exploring the dangers of alcohol.  During the song, Kendrick's conscience ""speaks"" to him.  One of the singers has an extremely deep, bass voice.""Lego House,"" is an easy listening song with a bit of a twist.  Ed Sheeran sings so quickly during portions of the song that it makes me wonder if he's had training as an auctioneer.  This is a beautiful love song.""Just Give Me a Reason,"" a duet by Pink and Nate Ruess is one of the strongest songs on the albums.  It's not fun! but it's definitely a great song. ;)""Begin Again,"" allows Taylor Swift an opportunity to show off her singer/songwriting chops in this pop/country cross-over song about moving on and getting over an old boyfriend.In a traditional country song, a series of ""What is your..."" questions are posed.  Blake Shelton sings the question, followed by the answer, ""Mine Would Be You.""  That silken voice punches out the lyrics.It is amazing the number of ways 'Mary' can be used, as shown in ""Merry Go `Round.""  The style of this song is blue-grass, with the sounds of a banjo being plucked.  Kacey Musgraves has a sweet voice, softening the gloominess of the lyrics.  ***WINNER - Best Country Album***The song ""Highway Don't Care"" is another example of a great duet created by the collaboration of two mega-stars.  The use of a song within a song is very clever, and I love that electric guitar!Finally, ""Take a Little Ride with You,"" is a good country song about enjoying the open road in your pickup and your woman.Take advantage of an opportunity to take a mini-break from the freezing temperatures, buy this CD, and put it on play.  With music this good, the temperature won't seem quite so bad.UPDATED 1/26/2014 with results and additional thoughtsWith a staggering number of nominees every year, the list of nominees who were not included on this album is always long. Although I've often wondered why some artists, who seemed like obvious choices were not included, I have always tried to rate the current year's album on the music that is included (which is almost always fabulous), rather than the music that is not included.  All of the winners can be seen at the official Grammy dot... website.In the spirit of recognition of those lost on the cutting room floor, some winners who were not included on the album, but who received their nominations live during the Grammy Awards include:WINNER - Best Rock Song ""Cut Me Some Slack"" by Dave Grohl, Paul McCartney, Krist Novoselic & Pat Smear.WINNER - Best Rap/Sung Collaboration ""Holy Grail"" Jay Z and Beyonc.WINNER - Music Educator Award Kent Knappenberger  1st Year awarded.

"For genuine fans of jigsaw puzzles, this little puzzle is quite a gem, but it is not a perfect product.  The reader is advised to take the word ""little"" quite literally in the case of this puzzle.  The entire assembled puzzle is roughly the size of a 3x5"" index card (like the cards you used for tracking references when writing a research paper for English class back in the day.)  Be sure to take a look at the picture provided on the Amazon product page.The shapes of the pieces are quite interesting and unusual, and they fit together in a manner that is similar, but surprisingly different than a paper-based puzzle.  Many of the adjoining edges have extremely tiny linking details; this is a feature that causes the puzzle to be a bit fragile.  Because of this feature, however, I do not recommend the puzzle for children who have not yet learned to handle things with patience and a delicate touch.  The pieces do not lock together, so, to keep from having to chase the assembled portion around the table surface, I used one hand to hold the pieces together and the other had to add another piece.  Additionally, since the puzzle does not rely a standard straight-line grid that is used on many machine-cut puzzles, the reference provided by the relatively straight alignment of pieces.  The pieces in this puzzle are not aligned in any manner, which adds to the complexity of assembly.  :)The picture is very nice, with a lot of details.  The surface of the puzzle, with its matte finish, is glare-free.  If you like to use puzzle glue, it would make a nice picture to put in a frame.A little bit of the color transferred off of the puzzle pieces onto my fingers, so be sure to select your assembly area accordingly.  (I don't think it would be a good idea to assemble the puzzle on a white linen table cloth.)  The empty re-sealable plastic bag containing the puzzle piece has residue, too.  (The color washed right off my fingers with normal hand soap.)One of the most interesting features of this puzzle is the tactile sensation you get from holding the wooden pieces in your fingers.  It is very interesting, and it's much more similar to holding a cardboard puzzle piece than I expected it to be.  When all things have been considers, all jigsaw puzzle fans should experience assembling this, or a similar puzzle.  It's an interesting experience, and the difficulty level is much harder than would be expected for a puzzle with only forty pieces.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XIRUJ2501WRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KWQUHY#wasThisHelpful","R1XIRUJ2501WRF","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Give the People What They Want,"" is, in a word, marvelous.  Sharon Jones has an incredibly rich and noteworthy voice.  She lays down tracks that sound like a cross between one of the best jazz bands you have ever heard, a soul group and a 1960's-style Motown group.  There isn't a sour note to be found on this album, and every song on this album is strong.""Retreat"" -As she belts out the lyrics to ""Retreat,"" Ms. Jones' voice is tinged with the enjoyment and satisfaction she would feel putting the man in his place.  As incredible as her voice is, when she hits the high notes, she does so with class, her powerful voice fully supported by every musician's best friend, a strong diaphragm.  (If you're not familiar with the reference, the diaphragm is the muscle below your lungs that allows you to project your voice)  The saxophone countermelody and the echoing refrains of ""Retreat"" from the group add to the fun, giving the song a party atmosphere.  The lyrics and the music make this a song of retribution ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" You have, indeed, been warned!""Stranger to My Happiness"" starts out with sound effects that resemble the sounds you'd hear from an alien spaceship.  A strong bass sax line starts up, and the song takes off.  The ""alien"" sound effects and the frequent repetition of ""mystery"" create the illusion that the singer doesn't know or understand how this man has such strong power over her, making her do things that are against her better judgment.The song, ""We Get Along"" is a soft song with a strong message on the importance of trying to get along with other people.  The message starts on a personal level, and is expanded out to the world at large with a touching verse about war.The rest of the album lives up to the high standards set by the first three songs on the album.  Each song is interesting in its own right, and for different reasons.  Don't hesitate.  Just treat yourself buy this album.  I did, and it's incredible!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29FZMC995KORL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GB35G2W#wasThisHelpful","R29FZMC995KORL","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a reverberating effect played on the keyboard throughout the song that seems to be the representation of a pulsar.  Taken along with the concept of a dark star and the vastness of the universe, this gives the song the overtones of alien origins from outer space.

"Ah, Life on the road, for the sake of your music.  While you're driving from coast to coast, playing gigs around the country, your vehicle is taking a beating.  The majority of this song is played in a positive and upbeat manner.  The guitars and the drums rock!  The song is very catchy, and the lyrics are interesting to listen to.  The ending of the song is different than the rest of the song, with an electric guitar note that reverberates for several seconds.  It has the effect of making you wait while you wonder what will be played next.  Perhaps it is meant to mimic the feeling of traveling endlessly back and forth across the country.""Coast to Coast"" is short (under two minutes), but it's long enough to get an idea of the talent behind the group, Waxahatchee. There's a lot of talent on display in this song, and it's very enjoyable to listen to. Thanks for the free download! I'm looking forward to hearing more.

"A classic rock tempo (a la the 1970s), supported by great electric guitars, drums and lyrics, provide the frame for the story about an incorrigible childhood friend in Boston Square.  The singer has great memories of the friendship, and growing up in each others company.  They part ways, and the friendship is lost to the passage of time.  The singer, however, misses the friend a great deal.  That comes through strongly in the last verse, when the singer thinks he catches a glimpse of the friend.  The style of the song softens, changing abruptly and dramatically, but picking back up again when the singer realizes he has to be wrong.The lyrics left me with the impression that the friend had committed suicide, and that the singer blamed the devil for the loss of his friend.  The story was so sad that I searched the Internet to see if I could learn a little bit more.  According to a web site that lists song facts (dot com), one of the members of the band, in an interview with Kerrang! (an English magazine), said that Boston Square was a tribute to a childhood friend who had committed suicide.  That is very touching.  I downloaded the song during a free promotion, and appreciate the opportunity to hear the music of this group.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VXPMXCJ806UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGIH65I#wasThisHelpful","R2VXPMXCJ806UC","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After looking at the picture, I expected the sleep shirt to be long.  However, I didn't expect it to feel a bit tight around the hips.  Additionally, when wearing the shirt, the neck line feels fine when you're sitting up.  However, it doesn't have any give at all, so when you sleep, it has a tendency to become a bit constricting, and it feels like it's too small, even though there is plenty of room (over 2"", in my case) in the neck while sitting up.

"If this is supposed to be the Earth, then the manufacturer needs a very basic lesson in Geography.  To draw a representation of the Earth, you cannot just take a blue ball and plop green blobs on it; the green blobs of the land areas need to have some type of correlation with reality.  In this day of computers, it would seem to be a simple matter of duplicating reality, and printing it on the ball.  In a class I took once, we had to draw the Earth from memory as part of the final.  My drawing skills would not, even remotely, be considered to be marketable.  I can assure you, however, that I could draw a picture of the Earth that represents reality much better than the (so-called) globes in this package.Note that one of the pictures of this product showed longitude and latitude lines, and one did not.  I received a package that did not include these markings, which was fine.  But if you want those markings, they are not there.  Also be advised that the globes are just a little bigger than a golf ball, so they arent as large as normal stress balls.  Im a woman, and I wrap my hand around the world so that it is hidden.I had wanted to use these Earth balls as part of a networking plan with global outreach.

"Soft strumming of the acoustic guitar introduces the song.  The vocalist joins in after a couple of bars, and begins singing in a voice that is wispy but crisp.  When the electric guitars and the drums jump in a couple of lines later, they do so with no reservations, briefly drowning out the singer's voice.When everyone joins in, the song becomes very energetic and fun.  The singer brings up the volume to the point where she can almost be heard clearly.  But the listener still needs to struggle to hear the lyrics at times, especially when she sings in the lower range of her voice.  Strangely, that unevenness simply adds to an overall effect that the band is just hanging out in someone's backyard garage, jammin' and having a lot of fun.As the song progresses, the distortion increases and guitars and the vocals become muddier and muddier.  This effect is especially interesting when it plays out on the electric guitar.  The music starts to sound wobbly, like a warped record that is being played on a turntable, and the sound waves are being distorted.  All in all, it's a very interesting effect.""Dust in the Gold Sack"" could just as easily have been called ""Cracks in the Ceiling"" since both phrases are repeated throughout the song.  Either way, the sentiment of the line is the same.  Things break down over time (seven years, in the case of this song).  I'm looking forward to figuring out what all of the lyrics are.  The ones I can make out sound very interesting.  Any song that includes phrases such as ""crunch of the black ice"" and ""green alligators"" is sure to be a lot of fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFNCYV7TAZTXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GAXT00W#wasThisHelpful","RFNCYV7TAZTXJ","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Black Widow is an exquisite song.  The dreamy music floats across the room on light and airy sound waves, entering the listener's ears and enchanting with a magical spell.  The lyrics are about a person from the singers past who lived a dangerous life-style, and is called Black Widow.The vocalist sings like she is lost in vivid and extraordinary memories from her past with Black Widow.  Her voice is reflective, wistful and full of longing.  She sings as if she knows she's incapable of resisting the allure of Black Widow, and she is resigned to her upcoming fate.The keyboards are perfectly understated, allowing the vocals of Sarah Chernoff to shine.  The very soft music is accented with ringing bell-like accents in the upper range that help to emphasize the range of Ms. Chernoffs voice. The precise timing of all of the musicians helps to maintain the ethereal feeling of the song all the way to the end.  Listening to this peaceful song, Im reminded of the clearest water in a mountain lake.  It's calm on the surface, but what's happening under the surface?Ms. Chernoff is a soprano.

"This is a great song.  It is very catchy and upbeat, and it includes some very interesting electronic sound effects.  Overall, the music tends to generate positive feelings in the listener.  (Yeah, I admit it, I was nodding my head to the tempo of the music the very first time I listened to it.)  Simply put, the song just sounds like everyone involved is having a lot of fun.That is, the song sounds like a lot of fun until the listener allows the lyrics to fully register in the mind.  It's then that the listener will realize that the words focus on a very serious subject - some of the types of mental disorders afflicting a segment of our population.  The subject is discussed in a very subtle way, by describing the behaviors.  While these serious conditions are being sung about, the peppy music, with the singer who sounds happy, continues.  This generates the feeling that the people who are being described (and perhaps even the listener and/or society at large) are in a state of denial about how serious their conditions are, and how their conditions are impacting their lives, and the lives of those around them.  The good vibes of the music simply lull the listener into thinking that everything is fine.Was this song written as a social satire, or as a commentary on the tendency of our society to allow too many people who are in need of mental health treatment to slip through the cracks?  It's hard to tell, and I'm not yet familiar with Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.'s work; however, he has a very nice voice, and I plan to listen to more of his music in the future. Time will tell.

"""Games"" has a nice upbeat sound and a great dance beat.  I enjoyed listening to the music, and it has all of the elements that will make it a successful pop hit.  (It's catchy, it has a good beat, it has an upbeat sound, and the message will strike a chord with listeners.)  Consequently, I suspect it is one of those tunes that you're going to get stuck in your head and you'll keep hearing it over and over again. The lyrics are very strong, and tell the story of the effect the actions of a person who plays games can have on the other person's emotional state.The vocals, however, seem to be a just a bit off.  For one thing, they are strongly accented in some unusual places.  There are also some strange vocalizations in the background that sound like a sick crow cawing.  It could be that the sound effects are supposed to mimic a cry of agony from a tortured soul, but I'm not sure.  It just didn't translate well for me.  And finally, there were some places in the music when the singing seemed slightly out of tune.  Again, that could be intentional. None of these things were bad enough to ruin the song, so I'll assume they were intentional sound effects.As a whole, I like the song.  The strong points outweigh the weak points, so I'm rating it (on the lighter side of) four stars.  And I plan to check out other songs by Claire to see how they compare, and I'll update my review when I've had a chance to make some comparisons.Thanks for the free download.

"To categorize ""Defeated No More"" as simply electronic and/or dance (or any other existing category) would be to understate the sheer novelty of the music.  The slow and steady tempo helps to keep the song from seeming overly long at six minutes, but that's not the only thing that keeps it from seeming like a song that lasts too long.  The song has a very unique and original sound, with new-age accents thrown in here and there.  It is fascinating, and it makes you want to hear what's going to happen next.  Although the song lasts for six minutes, the time seems to fly by, as you get lost in the music.The song is very laid-back, but the insistent rhythmic thumping of the padded bass drum pedal calls you to dance.  The percussions also include clapping (or keyboards made to sound like clapping), which is a good technique for engaging an audience.  To cap it off, the cymbals are played with brushes rather than drum sticks.  As the brush hits the cymbal, it has the effect of softening and diffusing that sharply precise <TWACK> that is more typically produced by drummers using drum sticks.The vocals are interesting, too.  The message in the lyrics matches the style of the music quite well.  The song is about a woman who broke up with a man and hurt him badly, and she wants to get back together.  Instead of allowing her to see that she still has an effect on him, he is taking it slow and easy, and allowing the fire to build back up, while always maintaining control of his emotions to see if she is capable of committing to him.  Both of the brothers have very pleasant voices, and one of them is even able to maintain the quality of his voice in the falsetto range.I'm so amazed this was offered as part of a free promotion!

"If you are a fan of hard-driving rock and roll guitars, you will probably enjoy, ""The Swan.""  Since the focus of this song is really on the guitars, the vocals seem to be a bit of an afterthought, but it doesn't seem to matter much, since you're listening to a band that is enjoying a jamming session.  I feel that the guitar notes are a bit too repetitive, and I would have liked to have heard more variety, but I enjoyed the song, nonetheless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32559PDHTSO2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARCQZZA#wasThisHelpful","R32559PDHTSO2O","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I listened to this song, I liked it.  After listening to it several times, that like had grown to love.  The interplay between the vocals and the guitar is phenomenal. The blend of the softly stated electric guitar played by John Gnossis and the unusual voice of Katie Bernstein transform this song from a good song to a great one.  Katie Bernstein's voice has a bit of a twang, but not in an even remotely country and western style.  Instead, her voice is filled with expression, as are the guitar lines, which are played in quite an expressive and emotive manner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30A2VN4WM3G8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DIKQ0Z8#wasThisHelpful","R30A2VN4WM3G8C","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The music is soft rock, and the voices of the ""On an On"" musicians blend very nicely.

"""Deficit"" is a very dark and moody instrumental song.  It is very atmospheric, and is something that I would expect to hear playing in the background of a movie about ghosts, as the tension is building towards the climax.  The second half of the song is a bit more upbeat, with a quicker tempo and more metallic highlights, but it would still be quite at home in a ghost movie.  It seems to drag on a bit longer than what seemed realistic for a song of this type, since the tension cannot last forever.  The weakest part of the song played out in the last 10 seconds or so, with seemingly otherworldly transmissions that didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the song.  But it was offered as part of a free promotional download, and for that, I'll round the rating up to four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35UXNQVVWLOKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F6CM68Q#wasThisHelpful","R35UXNQVVWLOKG","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Coast to Coast"" is a surprisingly short song (under two minutes), but it's enough to get an idea of the talented singer-songwriter behind the name, Waxahatchee.  The lyrics are interesting to listen to, and the drums and guitars rock.  The ending of the song in stylistically different than the rest of the song, and it has the effect of making you wait while you wonder what's next.  And then it abruptly cuts off, sounding like the needle was pulled off of the record, and the song is finished.  But I'm still intrigued, and I'm wondering what is next.  There's a lot of talent on display in this song, and it's very enjoyable.  Thanks for the free download!

"This ring is extremely beautiful.  I love the design (especially the middle portion of the band, with the stones), and the silver is the perfect metal for highlighting the cool beauty of the stones.However, I am heartbroken because the prongs holding the tanzanite to the right are sharp and pointy.  I'm torn between my desire to keep this ring and the desire to return it before it creates snags on my clothes.  I plan to exchange it, and hope that the replacement doesn't have the same flaw.  If it still has sharp and pointy prongs, it will be a good thing I have 30 days to decide...When I receive the replacement, I will update my review.UPDATE: 1/8/2013I received a replacement ring, and this ring does not have sharp and pointy prongs.  Note that, because of the individual prongs on the white topaz, the ring is just a tiny bit rough to the touch when you run your index finger over the stones.  It's not bad, and I probably only noticed it because of the sharp prongs on the first ring, but I would not want to wear this ring with extremely delicate fabrics.  Otherwise, the ring is positively delightful, and I love it! Since the issue with the sharp prongs has been resolved, I'm revising my rating to 5 stars. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUTBI3L04UZJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E44V27S#wasThisHelpful","RUTBI3L04UZJ1","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The pendant of this necklace is very interesting.  The snowflake and the disk weigh different amounts (the snowflake is lighter), so when you move, even though they are hooked onto the same ring, they move at different speeds. As the snowflake dances around in front of the crystal disc, the appearance of the snowflake seems to change.  I know it's an optical illusion, and it's enhanced by the slight curvature in the crystal disk, but it's an intriguing effect.  When you look at the necklace, it looks like you are seeing different snowflakes, all with unique designs, dancing around in the wind.The necklace looks best when it is worn against a dark background since the crystals pick up the color of the top you are wearing, and reflect those colors back to you. Note that when I looked at the necklace straight out of the box, I couldn't see a lot of sparkles from the crystals, so I wasn't sure I was going to like the necklace as much as I do.  It wasn't until I put the necklace on that the crystals started to sparkle quite a bit.  The snowflake portion of the pendant is beautiful, and it would look nice as a stand-alone necklace, but you'd have to pry the necklace ring open to separate the two.  It wouldn't be possible to wear them separately because you'd ruin the symmetry of the ring the pendants are hanging from, so don't take them apart unless you want to leave them apart permanently.The chain on the necklace isn't too bad for a necklace in this price range, but I'm not impressed with the parts that connect the ends of the chain to the clasp to the clasp hardware  It is strange, and it looks like it may have been glued together.  I don't want to risk losing the pendant, so I'll switch out to my own chain.  Meanwhile, I'll keep dancing like no one is watching so I can watch the colors sparkle in the light.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12HNKCQX8O54U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EP9BVWS#wasThisHelpful","R12HNKCQX8O54U","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since Amazon sells this product in a pack of four, I was taking a risk by purchasing it when I've never tried this flavor before.  But I like gingerbread, and I like most syrups, so I decided to take a chance.  When I opened the bottle, I noticed  the aroma is QUITE strong).  The first time I used it, I added just a tiny bit to my hot coffee.  It was good, but I was surprised that the flavor of the syrup came through so strongly, even after being diluted by the coffee.  It struck me that the thing that is missing is sugar, so I added a lot of sugar substitute and a lot of milk, and that seemed to do the trick.  After experimenting, I discovered that brown sugar complements the flavor quite nicely, but that defeats the purpose of buying the syrup in the sugar free version, doesn't it?  Every time I added a normal-sized portion of this syrup to a liquid, I regretted it, since the flavor of spices became overpowering.  So I'll add a drop here and a drop there, and maybe I'll use this up some time in the next decade.  :\","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRTWMB91B38VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWTZ6PQ#wasThisHelpful","RRTWMB91B38VA","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Paper Kites is a good group.  From this product page, however, you can't listen to samples.  It took me a minute to figure it out, but you can listen to samples from the albums.  Under the drop down menu of MP3 Music on Amazon, type ""Paper Kites.""  You will see the icons for the two albums included on this set.  You need to click on each of the individual albums to hear the samples.  (The cover art on the individual albums is nicer.) It would have been nice to get the MP3 version included in this set, but for the price, I can upload it myself.All of the songs from the two albums, ""Woodland"" and ""Young North"" are including in this compilation album.  It's a good price (currently $6.49) because if you pay for the two albums separately, it will set you back $8.98 total.  Note, however, that even though the two albums are combined, you are only getting a total of eleven songs.  The style is indie singer-songwriter type of music.  You've probably heard their music before, and you'll recognize at least some of these songs.  It's very soft and nice to listen to.  It reminds me of the music of Peter, Paul and Mary, and I'm looking forward to receiving my copy of this album.Although I have not yet listened to this particular album, and I generally do not write product reviews until I fully assess the entire product experience, I wanted to share with others how to listen to the samples while the price is so good.

"A traditional German carol, it's fitting the first verse is presented in German.  The different languages used (German, Italian? and English) in this version of the carol attest to the international appeal of the song.  The voices of the group are very light and uplifting, and their range is incredible.  It's unusual to hear a soprano being able to maintain the fullness of her voice in the extreme upper ranges, but their voices never become strained or pinched.  The harmonies are simply lovely, and the orchestral accompaniment enhances the song and makes the music soar.  At times, it seems almost angelic.Note: I downloaded the song during a free promotion, but it made me interested in the album.  When I checked, it was disappointing to see this song was not included in the album, ""Home for Christmas.""  I looked around, and did find it included as a bonus track on a different version the album.

"The introduction is very clever.  It begins with a very brief presentation of a traditional 1950's style of the carol, that is quickly derailed (with a great sound effect), and picked up by a more modern and upbeat sound.  The instrumental part of the introduction is a bit long for the audio listener, but the audience is cheering, so it makes me wonder what the band was doing on stage that was so entertaining.  It was Vegas, so I'm sure it was interesting!  ;)And then, with a seriously awesome drumroll introduction, the lyrics began.  While they got off to a bit of a rocky start, they quickly corrected course and began to soar.  The repeated refrain of,  ""Ho, ho, ho, let's go!"" began the full-on metal version of the song.  The electric guitar parts are excellent.

"It is nice to hear a song's melody carried by a contralto rather than the more typical soprano, proving that women do not need to sing in the upper range to create beautiful music.  Mary Chapin Carpenter has a rich and smooth contralto voice that matches the peaceful presentation of the song extremely well.  The back-up (piano, percussion) is soft and perfectly understated.  Her voice is very captivating and enchanting, and it is rich with emotion.  When this song began playing, it instantly attracted my attention, and I stopped what I had been doing.

"Raffi's recording of ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas,"" is only okay.  That is so sad, because the recording could have been a very fun and enjoyable version of a silly song that I would have loved to add to my annual Christmas playlist.The song is meant to be silly; the lyrics include the line, ""We fish you a hairy Chris moose.""  The children sound like they were picked out at random rather than being selected for their musical ability.  That is actually a bit sweet, since it makes the song sound more like something you would hear at home when you're joking around with your kids.  The instrumental back-ups are absolutely fantastic!However, there is an awful addition to the song in the final verse that just got on my nerves and made me cringe.  Someone sings in a screeching voice, ""Christmas, we wish you.""  It may have gone by quickly, but it was so annoying that it caused me to  reduce my rating from four to three stars.

"If you are just a casual reader, and you just want to satisfy your curiosity, or determine for yourself what all the fuss regarding this book is about, then I recommend downloading the digital version rather than buying the 3-D version.  The digital book is approximately 1/4 the price, so you may not feel like the book is overpriced for what it is if you don't ""get it"" right away, or if you find it offending.  Additionally, the best part of downloading the book digitally is that you can return it for free within Amazon's return policy if you don't like it.This book is a good stress reliever for harried parents.  Rather than pulling their hair out when the little ones simply will not stay put in their @)*(^&^# beds, parents can pull out this book, get a chuckle, and (perhaps) regain perspective.  The pictures are very cute and they are artfully done, and text manages to retain the lyrical sense of most well-written children's books, despite the occasional (ha, ha) use of the f-word.Although I think the book is an excellent parody, the format may lead little ones to think it is ""their"" book, so it's probably a good idea to keep it put away in a spot that is safe from prying eyes.  And you KNOW they will find it if you don't hide it very well.  (If you're worried about this, you can download the digital version and password protect it.)

In this app, you will find such an example of a great book. Note that this app is more of a traditional reading experience than some books that have been turned into games.  But that doesn't detract from the quality of the story because, for example, the lack of animation makes the story seem more like a book than a game.The story is enhanced by a professional narrator.  It seems as if a famous story-teller were reading the story specifically for you.  Additionally, there is some great music in the background, which matches the mood of the story, but it never gets dark and oppressive.  The pictures are very interesting, with a lot of details.  The Smurfs are placed into realistic pictures, making it even easier for children to relate to the story.Children of all ages should love this heart-warming story.

"Lovers of the traditional as well as lovers of music more modern are all likely to love this version of a classic Christmas carol. This song is filled with so many different stylistic approaches towards ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" that it's difficult to imagine how it would be possible to pull everything together into a cohesive whole.  But For King & Country is talented enough to be up to the challenge.  They manage the transition from a traditional carol to a more modern take on the music quite well, to the point of almost making it seem as if this was the way the song was always intended to be played.

"This necklace is very eye-catching.  The charms are perfectly spaced out.  They sit high enough that they do not get hidden below your shirt, and they sit low enough that they don't bother your neck.  They will be visible above your top. If you need to shorten the chain a bit, as with most 1928 necklaces, you just fasten the clasp a few links down the chain.  The pink color of the stones matches the gold tone of the necklace perfectly.I am a big fan of 1928 jewelry, and I've been buying it for about 20 years.  It is well-designed costume jewelry that retains its elegance over time.  Quite often, if you buy one piece of a set, it will work with other pieces you already own.  This piece fits in well with the other pieces in my collection.  By the way, I have a 1928 necklace with these same sparkly stones, which I purchased in the mid-1990's, and I still get complimented on it every time I wear it.  This necklace matches the earrings I bought to go with the original necklace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTWFKB6IPDBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECDAGFK#wasThisHelpful","ROTWFKB6IPDBP","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A teenager may be thrilled to receive this necklace as a gift because it has a diamond. :)  If you're shopping for an adult, however, that arrow may be pointing you towards purchasing a different product.  :\The design for this necklace struck me as a fresh approach to the common heart necklace, and it made me smile.  The description listed a diamond that, while small, was better quality than most diamonds found in a piece at this price point.  So I ordered the necklace in sterling silver, thinking it might make a nice gift.But I am disappointed, and my purchase of this necklace reminds me of why it can be risky to purchase jewelry from the internet.  In all fairness, I have had luck purchasing jewelry from the internet and catalogues in the past, but not in this case.The picture on the computer looks much nicer than the necklace does when you see it in person.  For one thing, the necklace is not as straight as an arrow. It is slightly bent and slightly twisted.  It appears that the shape of the arrow may have been altered during the process of attaching and securing the diamond.  The diamond is pretty; however, if you look at the picture, it is difficult to see where the diamond is located because the metal on the shaft of the arrow has been fashioned to give the appearance of six stones.  That's a nice concept, but it doesn't quite work.  The metal is duller on the shaft of the arrow than it is on the tips and on the ""feathers,"" so the optical illusion falls flat.  If the diamonds were there, the shaft would be sparkly and brighter than the ends.  So the beauty of the stone gets diminished because you need to look very closely to see the diamond.  These are all things that I would have noticed if I had seen the actual product before making a purchase.  I may have looked around for a necklace with the same design that did not have the twisted body, but I would not have purchased the exact necklace I received.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K2YCIFWKZYJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQ4L7R6#wasThisHelpful","R2K2YCIFWKZYJO","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the kind of music youd want to have played at the Christmas party youre attending.  Its upbeat, fun, full of driving energy, has a lot of tradition thrown in, and its a bit of a surprise, too.  There are two styles in the song that are completely different, so you might wonder how they could possibly work in the same song.  The underlying structure of the music (reliance on a three-beat measure), and the extremely fast tempo, along with the talent of the musicians just ties everything together very nicely.There is no doubt We Wish You a Merry Christmas is being played in this recording, but August Burns Red puts their own spin on the song by adding an original passage.  It is very interesting, and it has an excellent solo.  After that brief side note, the We Wish You a Merry Christmas refrain is introduced back into the song, and the band wraps it up from there.

"This is an extremely unusual rendition of ""Silent Night,"" performed on the acoustic guitar, and I must admit that I needed to listen to it six or seven times before it started to grow on me.  During the introduction, I thought John Fahey was attempting to play the song with a hint of a Hawaiian influence, but then the stylistic influences seemed to come into the song from a multitude of directions, almost to the point that the song seemed to lack cohesion in places.Do I want ""Silent Night"" played in this fashion?  Maybe not.  But I'll keep it around because it is fascinating to listen to the multitude of musical techniques he uses.  There is no doubt that Mr. Fahey was an extremely talented musician, and I enjoyed listening to the sheer artistry and creativity that went into recording the song.

"This scarf is beautiful!  The colors are gorgeous.  They add a splash of color to my wardrobe when I wear them with my black winter coat.  The black of my coat also helps to highlight the black in the scarf, having the effect of making all of the colors seem brighter.  Although the material is acrylic, it is extremely soft to the touch, and it feels nice against my face.  The scarf also does a decent job of retaining heat next to my body.  I would, however, want to wear something warmer on an extremely cold day.I am a bit worried the yarn will fray because the long edges of the scarf have very short pieces of colored yarn fringe (about 1/8 of an inch).  After a very close inspection, I observed that there is a line of black yarn (or thread) all along the long edges, and it appears to be there to keep the colored yarn in place.  The stiches are very small and uniform, so it looks like it may be a machine sewn seam.  If so, the yarn will be less likely to fray.  To finish off the edges of the short ends, the black yarn is gathered up and twisted together at each short end, leaving the black fringe you can see in the picture. Although I do not see any knots, the ends seem to be held together firmly.  There may be a small dab of transparent glue holding the ends of the tips together, so I'll need to be careful when I wash the scarf.  If this scarf is still for sale next year, I'll come back and post my experience regarding the scarf's durability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY4EWX5MQ7QT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FHVF5SO#wasThisHelpful","RY4EWX5MQ7QT6","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This necklace is my new favorite piece of jewelry.  The sterling silver enhances the cool tones of the purple and white crystals in a beautiful way that simply would not have been possible if the metal selected for this necklace had been yellow gold.  Ive gotten several compliments on this eye-catching necklace.The petals seem very realistic, an effect created by petals that are curved rather than flat.  The individual shaping of each petal can be more easily observed from the back of the pendant.  The back of the pendant is highly polished, smooth and pleasant to the touch.  Additionally, the gradual change of crystal colors on the petals, from clear in the middle to deep purple on the edges, mirroring the purple of the crystal in the center of the piece, enhances the beauty and artistry of the pendant.  I love that Swarovski Elements, with their superior quality, radiance and sparkle, were selected for this necklace.  Ive been a Swarovski fan for decades, and have never been disappointed by any of their crystals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQ9OFMJDZGV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3N5QOW#wasThisHelpful","RIQ9OFMJDZGV2","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The legs are designed so that the feet, with their small surface-gripping bumps, can be worn by women of various heights,  allowing the surface of the textured grips to provide traction on the floor and reducing the likelihood of falling.  For women who are not as tall as some others, the design also prevents all of the excess material from getting bunched up iin the feet.  The zipper opens and closes smoothly without getting stuck.  The Minnie Mouse design is simply adorable!  Additionally, the bright pink color and the wonderful softness of the material did not get damaged in the washing machine.

"Because of the simple instrumentals in the background of, ""Do You Hear What I Hear?"" the vocals must be strong enough to carry the song.  Gladly, this trio is more than up to the challenge.  The song contains beautiful and original harmonies that allow all three of the voices to capitalize on their strengths and shine.  The singers pass the melody and harmonies back and forth, allowing all of them to take on the different aspects of the song.Although there are hints of country and hints of rock and roll in the song, no one style has taken control of this song.  Georgia Middleman, for example, has a definite country twang in her voice, but that doesn't make this a country music song.  The overall style of the song is traditional, with extraordinary harmonies that add a layer of complexity to original version.If you like this version of the song, you may want to check out Carol King's version in A Holiday Carole.  It is very similar to this song, and is also very nice.

"Overall, I prefer this updated version of, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, to the classic version of the song.  The tempo and mood of the version performed by Big Daddy is brighter and more upbeat than the original.  The lead singers voice is rich and very pleasant to listen to.  The song is traditionally sung in a style that is reverent rather than joyful, and this version successfully turns that approach on its head.  However, the saxophone accents seem a little out of place with the style of the rest of the song.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M0DDURZ0V9PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OTLEG4#wasThisHelpful","R1M0DDURZ0V9PW","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With all of the focus on traditions during the holiday season, modern Christmas music isnt exactly easy to find, so I was delighted to come across this song. Twinkle (Little Christmas Lights) is an upbeat rock/jazz number.  I especially love the bass (sax) underscoring the upbeat nature of the music, with its swooping accents.

"When you purchase necklaces, you are often given a beautiful pendant, accompanied by a cheap and delicate chain, which needs to be replaced immediately if you dont want to risk losing the pendant.  That, however, is not the case with this necklace.  The chain of this necklace has a nice thickness, and it was designed to last.  You will be able to wear this necklace right out of the box without needing to worry about losing the pendant.  This is quality Christmas jewelry.From the pictures on the web page, it appeared the cut-out style of the design might make the Christmas tree pendant too delicate, and that it would not hold up well over time.  That is not the case, however.  The outlines of the tree are thick enough to provide stability, and again, it was designed to last.On the pendant, the ends of the branches of the tree are just a bit sharp.  You wouldnt be able to draw blood on them, but they have a definite point.  The points give the tree branches character and definition, and rounding them off would make the pendant less realistic and less beautiful.  Its not a major concern, but I wouldnt wear this necklace if I were wearing a delicate fabric that could pull easily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M227L1M3J90A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EP9BVVO#wasThisHelpful","R1M227L1M3J90A","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Spoiler Alert!  The review below will briefly discuss the plot of the samplers story.This musical sampler of the full-length story is interesting to me, as an adult.  The story is told via the narration, but it is also moved forward through the use of the music.  The best way I can think of to describe the musical style is to compare it to a miniature opera.If you are considering purchasing this for your child, Id recommend downloading it and listening to it before you play it for your child because only you would be able to understand how your child is likely to react to the album.  While the narrative is presented in a very calm and mellow voice that would be soothing to small children, the music is not quite so innocuous.  The music ranges from happy and light, to sad and melancholy.  In places, the dark colors of the cover are carried through into the mood of the music.  At times the screechy sounds of the violins make the music sound almost creepy, and the underlying story is about an adolescent girl with a broken heart.This sampler was offered as a free download the day I got it.  When considering the rating, Id place it at about 3  stars.  Since I downloaded it for free, Ill be generous and round the rating up to 4 stars, noting, of course, the caveat above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NLABAWNXG3A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GY6IVE6#wasThisHelpful","R2NLABAWNXG3A9","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Silent Night has been recorded so many times that it is difficult to record a song that stands out from the crowd.  Luckily, I was able to download the song during a free promotion.  Susan Aglukark has a voice that is light and ethereal, but which does not lose its richness, or timbre, when she sings softly.  She has one of the most enchanting voices Ive heard.  The accompaniment of the symphony orchestra heightens the beauty of the music, and the piano accents are especially noteworthy.This is a very traditional rendition of Silent Night, with a lovely blend of two languages, Inuktitut and English.  Inuktitut is the native language of the Inuk people in Canada.  Ms. Aglukarts music is universally recognized as superior.  She is so good that an article about her is included in the Native American Encyclopedia website.

"Prior to my decision to download this album, I had never heard of the group Dream Theater.  The song samples, however, intrigued me enough that I was willing to pony up the price of an album for a full musical tour; I simply wanted to hear more of what this band had to offer.  So I downloaded and launched the file.Right away, I noticed that the band had precise timing and perfectly blended instrumentals, and that the melody lines were complex and interesting.  I went back to surfing the net, thinking I would play the album in the background.  After listening for a few minutes, however, I realized that the music had completely captured my attention because my eyes were closed and my fingers were resting lightly on the keyboard, motionless.As a general rule, I am not a big fan of heavy metal music.  While I didnt like all of the parts of all of the songs, there wasnt a song on the album that I didnt enjoy, overall.  Im not sure that the description of heavy metal is accurate to describe the music created by Dream Theater.

"The Citizens, a Christian rock group, sing, ""Repeat the Sounding Joy,"" also known as, ""Joy to the World.""  The traditional hymn was rescored into a rock song, and it is a great version of the song.  So you may ask, Why only a three-star rating?  Thats a fair question, so I will attempt to explain my opinion.After a casual listening, from the other room, I was inclined to rate it with four stars, because I do like the song.  But when I came back into the room and played it again, listening more closely, I realized something was a little off.  And then it hit me that the vocals just aren't very strong on this recording.  While the lead signs in tune, and has precise timing, his voice lacks the rich depth needed to successfully carry this emotional song.  At times, his voice takes on a nasally quality, becoming thin and reedy.  Additionally, the back-up choir isn't quite up to par.  They do not sing or end their ""oh, oh, oh, oh"" refrains in a uniform manner, nor do they end their phrases at precisely the same time.  Additionally, some of the voices don't blend in well with the rest of the group.  The more I listened to the song, the more I realized it was just okay.The recording reminds me of a good high-school choir performance.  The song rocks if you're not expecting to hear a professionally performed song, but if you are expecting a professional presentation of a song, then this probably would not be the version of ""Joy to the World"" you would select for your library.  The singers were obviously joyful to be singing and praising God, so the enthusiasm needed to carry the song is there.  They just needed a lot of fine-tuning.  I hated to knock a star off of the rating, especially since I downloaded it for free.  But I have a lot of musical performances in my background, and to be truthful, I have to say that the performance (to my ears) is only okay.  You may enjoy it more or less than I did, but this is how it struck me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A0AD0BWI5L49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTZ6O2S#wasThisHelpful","R3A0AD0BWI5L49","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marvin Sapp provides us with a very traditional version of, What Child Is This?  The acoustic guitar in the background is very pretty, clam, and soothing.  Mr. Sapp has a strong voice that is nice and pleasant.  The background instrumentals echo the middle ages, the period during which the traditional English folksong, ""Green Sleeves,"" was used to change this into a religious song.  The recalling of the middle ages is a very nice touch.During the song the gospel group, Commissioned, is introduced with the phrase, Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioned.  The voices of the choir blend together exceptionally well.  However, the introduction broke the tranquil mood.  I felt like I had been left hanging in the middle of a phrase, and wondered what was being commissioned, and why it was being commissioned.  I finally had to look it up, and discovered that Commissioned is the name of a gospel group.  While it is commendable to publically acknowledge the contributions of the group, the introduction detracts from the strength of the recording.  People have the opportunity to read the song jacket and learn who is singing during the second part of the song.  This is, after all, not a live presentation.

"Amazons deals page uses the pretty cover art from this album, Punk Goes Christmas, by the band, All Time Low, to announce their free songs for Christmas promotion (on 12/1/2013, anyway).This is a song, with a fresh approach to Christmas, and it involves a love relationship.  The lyrics are very good.  The man (fool!) had previously taken the relationship for granted and neglected it.  Apparently, he has been kicked to the curb.  He wants to change his ways, and belts out this heart-felt song, full of emotion.

"This version of ""O, Holy Night,"" is very different, stylistically, from the classic version of the song.  But it is also a very nice version of the song.  An example of a previous stylistic change of this magnitude, that was hugely successful, is Neil Diamond's recording of ""Red, Red, Wine,"" which was later re-released by ub40.  In both cases, the two songs are completely different, but excellent.  And it is Group 1 Crew's approach to the song that allows them to own this song, and make it their own.

"Silent NightThis version of Silent Night has some counter-melodies and harmonies Ive never heard before, and the singers are pitch-perfect as they harmonize.  In the background, there is a very faint techno/electronic beat that echo the introduction.  The song is beautiful.  The only thing I find strange is that the volume of the techno/electronic beat in the introduction seems to be too loud.  After listening to the remainder of the song, in which that theme is echoed very faintly at the end of the phrases, the introduction seems out of place.  I wish the song had started off with the faint echoes; that would have mirrored the remainder of the song better.  But that minor point isnt enough to spoil this duets version of a classic.  Highly recommended!Note: I downloaded this song during a free Cyber Monday promotion.  The duets voices were so beautiful that I made a point of checking out their information page.  There, I found a tweet on the right-hand side of the page that was posted today, Worlds Aids Day December 1, 2013.  An additional song from Snow Globe can be downloaded for free, Bells of Love (Isabelle's Of Love).  The song is available to raise awareness.  You can preview the song on the Amazon web page, but it isnt listed for free (as of this writing) on Amazon.  I downloaded it by clicking on their link, but it doesnt show up in my Amazon Cloud, so if you want the song to be in your cloud, youll have to purchase it separately on Amazon.  The second free song can be accessed by clicking on the hotlink Erasure right underneath the title at the top of the Snow Globe web page on Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OPMNBWQ7DT4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBMK5IS#wasThisHelpful","R1OPMNBWQ7DT4H","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these pajamas last year.  The manufacturer, description and look has not changed, but the colors have. They came tied up with a red ribbon, and looked very classy. (The side pocket listed in the description is on the shirt, not in the pants.)  Bottoms Out Women's Flannel Pajama SetThe pajamas were so soft when they arrived that I was excited to try them on.  But then I was disappointed to discover that the arms and legs were extremely long. When wearing the top, the sleeves almost completely covered the ends of my fingertips (before I washed them). They were so soft and comfortable that I didn't want to send them back, so I washed them to see how much they would shrink. The arms shrank by about half an inch in the first wash.  I'm very cold-natured, but when wearing them, I was able to sit in a room at 67 degrees Fahrenheit without wearing a robe, and I wasn't cold. I decided to keep them because they were so soft and they kept me so warm.About six weeks later, I discovered that one of the seams on the leg was sewn too close to the edge, and the material tore. Since the sleeves were too long, too, I debated between getting my money back and exchanging them. In the end, I decided to exchange them.  In hindsight, I wish I would have gotten my money back. Over the year, they continued to shrink every time they were washed, until they became too small to wear comfortably.  But the thing that was the most disappointing is that they lost their soft and comfortable feel after being washed a few times.If you decide to try these pajamas this year to see if the quality has improved, then I wouldn't recommend paying full price. The quality I would expect from pj's priced at $48 just isn't there. I think a fair price would be around $17.50 or so.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31N1Y1EAGDWDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMZEQL2#wasThisHelpful","R31N1Y1EAGDWDG","AM4X3TREMZTQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM4X3TREMZTQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Absaloms Hair is a novel by Bjrnstjerne Bjrnson, winner of the 1903 Nobel Prize in Literature and one of the Four Greats of Norwegian literature. The story begins with an unlikely marriage between an intelligent, determined young woman and an abusive old adventurer. The product of this union is a son, Rafael Kaas. At a young age, Rafael demonstrates an exceptional talent for engineering, and his mother works to develop his faculties and secure his career prospects. Her love for her son becomes oppressive, however, and Rafael chafes under her motherly tyranny, especially when she attempts to separate him from the woman he loves.I enjoyed Absaloms Hair at first. I appreciated its depiction of Norwegian life, both at the rural seaside estate of HellebergeneRafaels ancestral homeand in the urban setting of Christiania (present-day Oslo). The characters were unique and intriguing. When things were going well for Rafael, I rooted for him and wished him success. When things started going badly for him, however, I had little sympathy for him because his misfortunes were largely due to his own stupid choices. The book ends up being a struggle between three or four main characters, all of whom treat each other like garbage. The title refers to a biblical legend which teaches a moral lesson; a lesson which is applied rather heavy-handedly in the books climax. By the time I got to the final third of the book, I had lost interest and was merely reading to get it done, out of morbid curiosity.Bjornson is a great writer and a brilliant observer of human nature, but this is not one of his better books. Many writers strive to depict genuine human emotions and psychological motivations, and Bjrnson does it very well, but without a moving story to back it up it all just seems like self-indulgent navel-gazing. In that sense, despite being over a century old, the book was a little too modern for my tastes. It resembles too many of todays novels in that it examines a dysfunctional family and asks the reader to identify with them and feel their pain, as if such psychological examination were enough to constitute a satisfying book. As a fan of older literature, I would have preferred a little more plot and a lot less angst.Im not sure when Bjrnson wrote this work, but the English edition came out in 1908. Also included in that edition was a short story entitled A Painful Memory from Childhood, which is also included in many of todays ebook editions. In this story, the narrator gives an account of a murder that took place in his home village when he was a young boy, and how the killer was brought to justice. Its brutal matter-of-factness is gripping and compellingly disturbing. Unlike Absaloms Hair, it shows off Bjornson at the height of his literary powers. I have previously been impressed by his short stories The Father and The Railroad and the Churchyard, and his novel A Happy Boy. For anyone interested in Norwegian lit, I would recommend spending a couple bucks on The Bjrnstjerne Bjrnson Megapack, the most comprehensive ebook collection of this authors works in English that I have yet seen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343L4NMI7MC8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008473OF4#wasThisHelpful","R343L4NMI7MC8G","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to the brief introduction by translator Jeremiah Curtin, In Vain was the first published novel by Nobel Laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz, written when he was only 18 years old. Originally published in 1876 under the Polish title of Na marne, Curtins English edition did not come out until 1899, after Sienkiewicz had achieved some worldwide renown as the author of romantic epics like Quo Vadis and The Trilogy (With Fire and Sword, The Deluge, and Pan Wolodyjowski). In Vain is no epic, but it is definitely romantic, in the 19th-century sense of the word. Curtin describes the book as a portrait of student life, and thats certainly how it starts out, but not how it ends.A young man named Yosef Shvarts (Curtin always opts for phonetic spellings of Polish proper nouns) arrives in Kiev to attend school. He runs into an old hometown friend, Gustav, and the two decide to room together. Yosef is the son of a blacksmith, so although he is lucky to be able to attend school, money is scarce and he must live frugally. The two friends hang out at a student club with a group of schoolmates who share their bohemian lifestyle. Gustav is in love with Helena, an attractive widow who has been traumatized by the death of her husband and child. Upon meeting Yosef, however, she immediately becomes obsessed with him because he reminds her of her deceased husband. Needless to say, this doesnt sit well with Gustav and causes a great deal of tension between the two roommates.Meanwhile, Yosef falls in love with science and studies to become a doctor, but that element of the narrative is neglected in favor of the love story. The novel harkens back to an earlier and far more conservative age when kissing a woman was as good as a marriage proposal (although at times its hinted, ever so subtly, that theres more than just kissing going on). Men of a certain class were expected to conduct themselves honorably in all things, like the knights of old. To play games with a womans virtue would spell the end of ones reputation as a gentleman. Under such restrictive conventions of romance, Yosef finds himself in a quandary between love and duty.The first half of the book is very engaging. The depiction of student life in Kiev is interesting, and the characters and their relationships are intriguing. Eventually, however, the novel regresses into a rather formulaic he-loves-me, he-loves-me-not story, reminiscent of some of the fairy tale romances that are more at home in Sienkiewiczs historical epics. The character of Augustinovich, a friend and confidant of Yosefs, even resembles The Trilogys Falstaffian character Pan Zagloba in his sense of humor, his gregariousness, and his propensity for meddling in others love lives.In Vain is not a terrible book, but it may be the worst piece of work Ive ever read from this excellent author. Only diehard fans of Sienkiewicz should give this one a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R399THP3Q5W1AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLL8VAM#wasThisHelpful","R399THP3Q5W1AF","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mystery of the Yellow Room is a novel by Gaston Leroux, best known as the author of The Phantom of the Opera. Originally published in 1907, it is the debut adventure of Joseph Rouletabille, a newspaper reporter with an uncanny knack for solving puzzling crimes. The character is clearly influenced by Sir Arthur Conan Doyles Sherlock Holmes and Edgar Allen Poes C. Auguste Dupin. One unique twist is that Rouletabille, at only 18, is closer in age to Encyclopedia Brown. Nevertheless, dont make the mistake of underestimating this amateur sleuth. His reasoning powers are advanced for a man so young, and the book is clearly intended for an adult audience. This novel is highly regarded as one of the first and best examples of the genre of the locked room mystery. The story and the character both have great potential, but overall I was disappointed by the novels slow pace, tedious details, and convoluted plot.Professor and Mademoiselle Stangerson, father and daughter, reside in a chateau in the region of Seine-et-Oise, outside Paris. Both scientists, they conduct experiments in their laboratory, which is located in a pavilion on the grounds of their estate. Adjacent to the lab is a bedroomthe so-called yellow roomwhere the mademoiselle sometimes spends the night. Late one night, after she has gone to bed, her father is still working in the lab. He suddenly hears the sound of screams and gunshots coming from his daughters room. He rushes to her aid and, with the help of some servants, breaks down the locked door. Inside, he finds his daughter alive but half-strangled and beaten. Someone has attempted to murder her, but the assailant is nowhere to be found, and there is no visible means of exit from the locked room. The next day, news of the attack has spread, and reporter Rouletabille wants details. With the help of a friend who is acquainted with someone in the household, he gains entrance to the chateau and is allowed to examine the crime scene.Through the first several chapters of The Mystery of the Yellow Room, I was enthralled. After a while, however, it started to remind me of the television series Lost: it kept raising more and more questions without ever offering any answers. Obviously, all these strange occurrences and confusing twists were intended to set up a big reveal in the books final chapters. Leroux doesnt realize, however, that to keep your audience interested you have to throw them a bone once in a while. It felt like a cheat when, in the middle of the book, it is revealed that Rouletabille had prior interaction with some of the principles in the case before the crime was committed. The mystery hinges on a complex series of entrances, exits, and escapes, so the reader must wade through far too many chapters that minutely describe the arrangement of hallways, doors, and windows. When the solution to the case is finally revealed, it ends up being a letdown, because many of the revelations arent really all that surprising.Like I said, it had me from the start, so its a shame this mystery couldnt live up to its promise. Rouletabille is an interesting character, but hardly a match for Holmes, at least not in this book. If youre looking for a French counterpart to Conan Doyle, I would recommend Maurice Leblancs stories featuring Arsne Lupin. They are at least as intellectually challenging as The Mystery of the Yellow Room, and a lot more fun.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6OFY0CW3EBGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082S2AT6#wasThisHelpful","R6OFY0CW3EBGQ","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If theres a better all-around storyteller in the English language than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Im not sure who it would be. I know, these days its probably more fashionable to drop some modernists name into the debate, but Ill take Conan Doyles good old-fashioned fireside storytelling any day. When you step away from his Sherlock Holmes works and dive into one of his other short story collections, you never know what youre going to get. It could be mystery, medicine, horror, science fiction, espionage, literary parody, or even a childrens story. Danger! and Other Stories, originally published in 1918, delivers all of the above. Overall, this grab-bag may not be Conan Doyles best work, but its always a joy to wander through this masters workshop and just marvel at his versatility.Almost all of these ten stories had been published in The Strand magazine prior to being collected in this volume. The title selection, Danger! Being the Log of Captain John Sirius is a 1914 story that presages the outbreak of World War I. England declares war on the small European nation of Norland. The minor power retaliates by terrorizing the British Empire with its tiny navy. Conan Doyle wrote the story to warn Britain of a weak spot in her defenses. His choice to tell the story from the point of view of the Norland naval commander is a stroke of genius that injects a dash of humor into this wartime adventure. Another World War I-related tale is The Prisoners Defence. A British soldier is charged with the murder of his lover. When brought to trial, he recounts to the courtroom how he met and fell in love with the victim, a French woman with a vehement hatred of the Germans. What starts as a courtroom drama turns into a first-class thriller.The Horror of the Heights is a top-notch sci-fi classic that also appears in the collection Tales of Terror and Mystery. One Crowded Hour is a fun tale of highway robbery in the early days of the automobile. The Surgeon of Gaster Fell offers a mystery with lots of spooky imagery of the remote moors, reminiscent of The Hound of the Baskervilles. Conan Doyle indulges his fascination with the paranormal with How It Happened, a macabre tale related by a writing medium. The most unusual piece in the book is The Three of Them, which transcribes a series of dialogues between a father and his three young children. The topics of conversation range from animals to cricket to God. The subject matter has the potential to be cutesy and annoying, but the way Conan Doyle handles it is quite clever and charming.Alas, they cant all be winners. A Point of View is a strange little piece of social commentary which discusses the differences in the servant classes of England and America. The Fall of Lord Barrymore is a slapstick comedy about a bully nobleman getting his comeuppance. At the bottom of the heap is Borrowed Scenes, about a young man who decides to live life in the style of his idol, English novelist and travel writer George Borrow. This consists of asking a lot of bizarre questions and generally acting like an ass. Having never even heard of Borrow before, the humor was lost on me.Though Conan Doyle doesnt hit it out of the park with every story, any collection of his short fiction is likely to please more than disappoint, and Danger! is no exception. Its diversity is its biggest strength. Approach this collection ready for anything, and follow the master wherever he leads.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27T4OUSKTY01W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TIL57Q#wasThisHelpful","R27T4OUSKTY01W","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the eighth installment in the ten-volume series Stories by American Authors, published by Charles Scribners sons in 1884. It consists of five short stories that were originally published in magazines like Century, Putnams, and Harpers. The vast majority of authors featured in the Stories by American Authors series are unknown to todays readers, and you wont find any household names in Volume VIII. The quality of the overall series has been spotty at best, and this collection continues the trend. Of the five stories included here, one is excellent, two are pretty good, and the remaining two you could do without.Despite its pretentious title, Split Zephyr: An Attenuated Yarn Spun by the Fates by Henry A. Beers is the best story in the book, and one of the best so far in the series. On commencement night, five Yale graduates discuss their future plans. Four classmates, conveniently initialed A, B, C, and D, spell out their intentions to the narrator, Frank Polisson. Fifteen years later he checks up on them to see what theyve made of their lives. Its a thought-provoking piece on the elusive nature of happiness. The message is a simple one, but meaningful even for todays reader. The characters are admirably well-sketched, and their engaging life stories offer an intriguing glimpse into the options available to a gentleman of the 19th century.Another promising selection in the book is Zerviah Hope by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, about a mysterious New Yorker who volunteers to nurse the sick in a remote South Carolina town stricken by an epidemic of fever. The story is quite riveting until the end, when it turns into a religious tract. The Life-Magnet by Alvey A. Adee fares better. An American student, spending a hiatus in Freiberg, Saxony, meets a scientist who claims to have discovered a means to chemically isolate the human life force. Its a crafty bit of old-school science fiction, though unfortunately marred by a confusing ending and a rather dim-witted hero.Two pieces remain at the bottom of the barrel. J. W. DeForests The Brigade Commander takes place during the Civil War. It opens with some interesting human drama, but that storyline is soon abandoned in favor of a tedious military history narrative replete with artillery movements and flanking maneuvers. Wargame enthusiasts might enjoy it, but its definitely not my cup of tea. The book closes with its worst selection, Osgoods Predicament by Elizabeth D. B. Stoddard. This meandering melodrama concerns a man of limited means who is supported by his wealthy aunt and uncle. After becoming engaged to a high-class woman hell never be able to comfortably support, he regrets his decision and runs away to Cape Cod. None of the characters are particularly appealing, so the reader couldnt care less.As a whole, the Stories by American Authors series has failed to impress. Nevertheless, this is one of the better books in the series so far, placing third behind volumes III and VI. At the very least, those interested in 19th-century literature will likely find the Beers and Adee selections to be worthwhile reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPCLR7XOAO38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TOVOJO#wasThisHelpful","R3UPCLR7XOAO38","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Gold Diggers, published in 2010, author Charlotte Gray crafts a fascinating history of the Klondike Gold Rush. Covering the period from June 1896 to the Summer of 99, Gray charts the trajectory of gold fever in the Yukon Territory from its boom to its bust. I first became aware of this book through the television miniseries Klondike, a highly fictionalized adaptation produced for the Discovery Channel (which is very good, by the way; rent it if you havent seen it). Im a huge fan of the author Jack London and his stories and essays about the Klondike. I was eager to learn the truth behind the fiction, and Grays account does not disappoint. The real history that she presents in Gold Diggers is every bit as exciting, fascinating, and incredible as Londons wildest literary interpretations.Gray approaches the subject as a group biography, intertwining the lives of six diverse Gold rush participants: prospector Bill Haskell, author Jack London, entrepreneur Belinda Mulrooney, Jesuit priest Father William Judge, British journalist Flora Shaw, and Officer Sam Steele of the North-West Mounted Police. Although these six larger-than-life personages get the most attention, there are plenty of supporting characters that stand out as well, from government bureaucrats to newspaper editors to dance hall girls to Klondike Kings who struck it rich. In fact, its often difficult to remember who Grays six primary subjects are, because what really comes through is the story of a community. Gold Diggers is first and foremost the biography of a town: Dawson City. Gray relates the life of this remote mining outpost from its origins as a mud flat at the confluence of two rivers to its dubious distinction as the Paris of the North to its eventual mass abandonment in favor of the next big score.At first I wasnt very impressed by Grays approach. The initial chapters concentrate solely on Bill Haskells journey to the Klondike. Having read everything that London ever wrote, Haskells adventures sounded rather familiar, and Gray relies so heavily on Haskells memoir that I wondered why I shouldnt just read that instead. However, once Haskell arrives in the Yukon and Gray begins to broaden her scope, I was hooked. Ive read several biographies of London, but Gray opened my eyes to specific details about his Klondike experience that often get left out of the more general cradle-to-the-grave accounts. At times Gray takes some artistic license with her material, describing the thoughts in her subjects heads or minute details of their daily activities that wouldnt normally make it into the history books. She has a knack for combining historical facts with descriptive passages of literary quality. Where the book really succeeds is in its establishment of atmosphere. You truly get a sense of what it felt like to walk the muddy streets of Dawson, dance in its smoky saloons, hike a frozen river at 50 below, or hunker down in a drafty cabin for a long, lonely winter. You become so involved with the lives of Dawsons inhabitants that after a while you feel like a citizen yourself. Gray vividly recreates the Klondike in all of its beauty, adventure, and filth.The book ends with a whatever happened to . . . essay on the six main characters and an extensive bibliography of Grays sources. As satisfying as this book is, she has inspired me to want to learn more. Anyone interested in the Klondike Gold Rush will love Gold Diggers. Even if youre only slightly intrigued by this episode of history, give this book a try and you too may be stricken with gold fever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WHL05ZM3VGD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042X9WLY#wasThisHelpful","R1WHL05ZM3VGD9","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am currently pursuing a masters degree in library and information science. The introduction to The Oxford Guide to Library Research was assigned as a supplemental reading for one of my courses. I liked what author Charles Mann had to say and decided to read the entire book, both for my own benefit as a student and for the benefit of my future library patrons. It should be clarified up front that the libraries being discussed here are research libraries. Usually this means an academic library at a college or university, but also includes private institutions and governmental libraries such as the Library of Congress, where Mann works. I purchased the 2015 ebook edition. Not only was it far less expensive than the required textbook for my course, it also proved to be vastly more beneficial.Manns approach to this research guide is unique. Instead of categorizing his research lessons by topic area or type of information resource, he has organized the chapters by search method. For example, he covers searching by Library of Congress subject headings, by database descriptors, by keywords, by citations, and by browsing bookshelves. Mann covers many online resources, but few of them are free and open to the general public. Most are only available to users who log in through their librarys website. In addition to whats on the web, theres plenty of research material thats not available online at all, and Mann recommends print resources when applicable, such as reliable print bibliographies or archival materials. Mann tells you what resources are the best, where to find them, and how to find what youre looking for within them. He even reminds us of one source of information we often forget: actually talking to knowledgeable people.At first I wasnt crazy about Manns presentation. At the front of the book there are lengthy lists and descriptions of academic databases. I think I would be better off just exploring the list on my universitys website. The farther I got into the book, however, the more impressed I was by Manns recommendations. I learned a lot from his chapter on crafting search queries, which goes way beyond the typical Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT. He opened my eyes to a wealth of available information resources of which I was previously unaware and cant wait to dig into.This book is packed with useful information, but the writing can wear on you with its redundancy. Mann argues that brick-and-mortar libraries have an immensely greater breadth and depth of information to offer researchers than whats available on the internet. He also asserts that the search methods he describes yield much more targeted results than simply entering a keyword into the search box on Google. I wholeheartedly agree with Mann on both these points, but I didnt need them hammered home four or five times each chapter. Another unfortunate mark against this book is that it is riddled with typographical errors. Apparently Oxford is using spell check for its proofreading, because countless instances of subject-verb disagreements and missing or duplicated two- and three-letter words went unnoticed. These errors dont hamper the readers understanding, but they do annoy.Despite my complaints, this book really has a lot to offer. It will prove extremely valuable for incoming undergraduate students who are clueless about what academic libraries have to offer. It will also greatly benefit doctoral and professional researchers looking to track down every last source on a given subject. I wish this book had been a required text for my reference services class in library school. Its a must-read for any academic librarian or any student serious about research.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8QH021C3W04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHQFMNY#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8QH021C3W04","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harold Bindloss was an early 20th-century English author who wrote many novels set in Western Canada. Northwest! was published in 1922. I have heard Bindloss described as an adventure writer, andalways on the lookout for the next Jack London or Bret HarteI thought Id give him a try. If this book is any indication, however, Bindloss barely qualifies for the adventure genre. Northwest! is like an English society novel that just happens to be set in the Canadian wilderness.The story takes place somewhere between Calgary and Vancouver, at a luxury hotel perched in a scenic mountain locale. Jimmy Leyland is an Englishman, the heir to a cotton mill fortune. Forced to undergo a waiting period before he assumes his portion of the family business, he drifts around Europe for a while before deciding to explore Canada. Jimmy hooks up with a mountaineer named Stannard who acts as a sort of mentor, instructing him in the ways of the idle rich. The two live the lives of extravagant tourists, lounging around the hotel and engaging in all-night bouts of gambling between hunting, fishing, and climbing trips. Traveling with them is Stannards daughter, who just happens to make a convenient love interest for Jimmy. British Columbia is a long way from London or Lancashire, and life in a western town can be a great leveler of class distinctions. As a result, Jimmy and Stannard find themselves associating with rougher characters like Deering, a professional gambler, and Okanagan Bob, a local jack-of-all-trades with Indian blood in his veins. A fine English gentleman but a bad card player, Jimmy soon finds himself racking up debts that may lead him into trouble.The main thrust of the story revolves around a pursuit through the Rockies, but it takes a dozen chapters of dining room conversations just to get the ball rolling. Regrettably, the whole business hinges on a stupid mistakea literal shot in the dark. The action is slow and the attempts at suspense are tame. The dangers of the wilderness never seem perilous enough. In Bindlosss hands, the wilds of British Columbia come across like an English game preserve. There is a stretch of the book in which Jimmy is alone in the wilderness, yet he isnt really alone. He has an Indian guide and packer with him. Yet the Indian is basically invisible, and never speaks. Bindloss treats him like a backpack, not worthy of notice, even though he might very well be keeping the hero alive. Contrast that with Londons tales of the Canadian wilderness, in which Native Americans are integral players in the narrative.This book is not terrible, but theres little to distinguish it from the ordinary. Adding to the mediocrity is Bindlosss repetitive prose. His favorite adjective is keen, and he uses it 86 times. People are keen, glances are keen, temperatures and winds are keen. To the books credit, at times I did care about the charactersJimmy is likeable for the most part, even though hes a bit stupid and naivebut often I couldnt care less.Bindloss was a prolific author, and I still think he might have a good book in him, but Northwest! isnt it. Its an OK read, but not worthy of the audacious exclamation point in its title.

"China Flight, published in 1943, is a novel by Nobel Prize winner Pearl S. Buck. It is not one of her better known works, and possibly hasnt been reprinted since the 1950s. I sought out this book because I suspected it might be the third novel in a trilogy with Dragon Seed (1942) and The Promise (1943). I was wrong about that, however, and it turns out that China Flight is a stand-alone novel. Regardless, I enjoy Bucks writing and am rarely disappointed by her novels, so I was happy to read this book, even though its not one of her more renowned works.The story begins shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. America has declared war on Japan, and all Americans are ordered to leave Japanese-occupied Shanghai. For one reason or another, three Americans have lingered past the departure deadline: Lieutenant Daniel James of the U.S. Marines, beautiful young journalist Jenny Barchet, and feisty middle-aged missionary Mrs. Shipman. These three, previously unacquainted, are apprehended and brought before the local Japanese commander. He makes Daniel a prisoner of war, interns Jenny in her hotel, and confines Mrs. Shipman to her mission. This brief meeting cements a bond between these three captives, and as each contemplates how to escape from his or her individual predicament and flee the Japanese, each resolves not to leave the other two behind.The villain of the story is the Japanese official, Shigo Kuyoshi, a highly educated, culturally refined dandy, whos nevertheless a brutal sadist. He falls in love with Jenny and wants to bend her to his will. Not surprisingly, Lieutenant Dan vows to protect her virtue. Shigo is a stereotypical villain, though thankfully not a racial stereotype. Buck, having been raised in China, is as free from anti-Asian racism as any American writer of her time. Nevertheless, this was World War II, so every Japanese soldier is depicted as unequivocally evil. Unlike many of the motion pictures of this time period, however, Shigo is not portrayed as a subhuman monster, but rather as the sort of oily, psychotic bad guy that nowadays might be played by Cristoph Waltz. Another Asian character that plays an important role in the book is Leone Hatford, a half-Chinese, half-French woman, married to a British banker, who attempts to aid the three captives in their escape. She becomes just as much a protagonist as the American characters of the novel.Right from the get-go, China Flight is an engaging thriller, but as the story proceeds Buck drifts away from the action-adventure narrative in favor of soap-opera melodrama. This is a solid World War II era potboiler, but nothing exceptional in terms of literary quality. Unlike most of Bucks novels, you wont learn a lot about Chinese culture from this book. This is not a frank and brutal depiction of the reality of war under Japanese occupation, like Dragon Seed, but rather a romantic tale of wartime heroism focusing mostly on the American concerns of its American heroes. Despite the deep cultural knowledge of its author, this book feels more like a product of Hollywood than of Shanghai.If youre an enthusiastic fan of Buck, youll probably like this novel well enough. Its no The Good Earth, but it has its merits. If youre just a casual reader of Bucks fiction, theres no need to go out of your way to hunt this one down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23QYOQ0IWWO2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007DRT18#wasThisHelpful","R23QYOQ0IWWO2Y","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Camille Flammarion was a French astronomer and a prolific author who wrote both scientific texts and popular literature. His novel La Fin du Monde was published in 1893 and has since been translated into English as Omega: The Last Days of the World. Flammarion was a contemporary of Jules Verne, and both were pioneers of the science fiction novel. Judging by Omega, however, Flammarion is less interested than Verne in telling a crowd-pleasing story, and more concerned with educating people about science. If Verne was 19th-century Frances Michael Crichton, Flammarion was its Carl Sagan.Astronomers have sighted a comet hurtling towards the Earth from the deep reaches of space. Intricate mathematical calculations determine that this comet will pass frighteningly close to our planet, perhaps even colliding with us. Spectrography reveals that the comet is composed primarily of carbonic oxide gas, with a few large, solid uranolites and bolides mixed in. Even if no catastrophic impact results from these solid meteorites, the comets gaseous matter is likely to have deadly effects on the human race, perhaps suffocating us all or igniting our entire atmosphere into flame. An emergency conference is called in Paris, at which experts from many disciplinesscientific, philosophical, religiousdebate the effects of the comet and the possible end of life as we know it. Outside in the streets, humanity desperately awaits their verdict on the future of our world.All of this takes place in the 25th century. At first, 25th-century France doesnt seem to differ much from its 19th-century past. Gradually, however, futuristic details are revealed such as domesticated monkeys and the inhabitants of Mars. For the most part, this novel has no characters. As described above, various dignitaries make their speeches, but Flammarion usually refers to the human race or the inhabitants of Paris as a whole. Mostly he describes the scientific properties that govern the Earth and the Universe. He explores every possible outcome of the comet collision, as well as speculating what the end of the world will look like if nature is allowed to run its course. Though the book lacks the heroic narrative one expects from science fiction literature, Flammarions novel is nonetheless fascinating. His account of the Earths demise is related with the frank and factual delivery of science journalism.Needless to say, the science is not always accurate. Mars is still described as having seas. Geology is discussed with no awareness of plate tectonics. Flammarion describes the burning of the sun entirely in mechanical (non-nuclear) terms. For him, the suns light arises from flame not fusion, because nuclear physics hadnt been invented yet. Despite these forgivable inaccuracies of a century ago, the novel succeeds in inspiring a wonder for science and the marvelous workings of the natural world. Admittedly, there are a few dull digressions here and there, but Flammarions boundless imagination and audacious speculations never fail to impress. Towards the end he includes some romantic passages that unfortunately betray the relentlessly rational, materialistic approach established throughout. I enjoyed the book so much overall, however, that Im willing to forgive a little gratuitous spiritualism. Anyone who enjoys vintage science fiction or appreciates classic books that werent afraid to tackle big ideas should definitely check out Omega. It will not disappoint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24SP3C347FQVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004V9KEQG#wasThisHelpful","R24SP3C347FQVR","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moving the Mountain, published in 1911, is a utopian novel by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. The story opens in the remote reaches of Tibet, where American Ellen Robertson is miraculously reunited with her long-lost brother John, who ventured into Tibet 30 years ago and was never heard from again. Once rediscovered, John suffers some ill-defined sort of amnesia in regards to his Tibetan years, and returns to Western Civilization as a sort of awakened Rip Van Winkle. During the last three decades, the world has changed dramatically, and his sister gradually introduces John to the revolutionary progress that has taken place in American society.Moving the Mountain is the first book in a utopian trilogy, followed by Herland and With Her in Ourland. It is often described as a feminist utopia, but feminism is really only a small part of this book, which addresses many different aspects of society. Its true that the first thing John notices about this changed world are its new women, who have careers and are no longer dependent on men to survive. The economy is socialistic. Everyone works, but only four hours or less per day. Food preparation and child care are communal, both conducted scientifically for optimum health. Religion has been supplanted by a humanistic worship of life and love. Few stones are left unturned in Gilmans depiction of her ideal society, and many of her prescient visions have already reached fruition in the century since the books publication. Overall this is one of the more practical and realistic utopias Ive ever readnot too far-fetched in its wish listyet like almost every literary utopia it requires a populace utterly devoid of laziness, greed, or stupidity.As far as utopias go, Gilmans world seems like a pretty great place to live, but it does have its dark side too. Some aspects of the new society sound awfully fascistic, particularly in the areas of sex and family issues. Eugenics is brought up more than a few times in a positive light. In order to achieve their social paradise and cleanse the human race of its impurities, these brave new worlders eliminated or sterilized many of their criminals, perverts, idiots, and degenerates (no specificity in regards to the latter term, but one can guess). Anyone who contracts a venereal disease is prohibited from reproducing. Hundreds of thousands of prostitutes are allowed to reform and take up respectable jobs, but are likewise denied reproduction. Its apparent that civil liberties werent a big concern back in Gilmans time. The result is a sexual revolution thats remarkably sexless.The fact that the book is well written goes a long way to making such content palatable. Gilmans clear and animated prose is a joy to read. The book is mostly just a series of conversations with little additional plot, but the fact that Gilman has made the narrator a skeptic and a curmudgeon makes for some lively dialogue and keeps the talkiness from getting tedious. The reader follows John Robertsons gradual transition from knee-jerk resistance to reluctant conversion. This approach elevates the book above equally preachy but more boring utopian treatises like Edward Bellamys Looking Backward.I enjoy reading utopian novels of every stripe, whether I agree with their ideas or not. A few of the ideas expressed in Moving the Mountain, however, actually made me feel uncomfortable. Nevertheless, Gilman impressed me enough as a writer that Ill probably give Herland a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIW66TMH96P6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K17XX6K#wasThisHelpful","RIW66TMH96P6I","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was assigned Robert J. Glushkos book The Discipline of Organizing for a class on Organization of Information in a masters program for library and information science. I bought the Professional Edition ebook, published in August 2014 by OReilly. Although my course was in library science, this book is not specific to that field. Glushko, with the help of his various coauthors for each chapter, looks at the fundamental and universal concepts and methods that go into creating any organizing system, regardless of discipline. In fact, with this book he attempts to found a new discipline, hence the books title. Though he touches on concepts from computer science, web design, library and information science, museums, archives, business, and law, he creates a sort of universal field theory of organization that encompasses all these disciplines and more.To accomplish this, he must create a unique vocabulary that both draws terminology from multiple disciplines and creates new terms when needed. Once he establishes this new vocabulary, the rest of the book is written in it, which can make for some tough going for the reader. No matter from which field you are approaching the book, chances are youre unfamiliar with all the other fields hes drawing from. One way Glushko alleviates this disorientation is by illustrating theory with numerous examples. Some of the favorites that he reuses throughout the book are utensils in a kitchen, shirts in a closet, or animals in a zoo. In addition to these universally identifiable organizing systems, he also cites plenty of examples from professional practices like library cataloging or the design of e-commerce websites.Another method Glushko uses to render this complex subject matter more palatable is to develop user-friendly models for various aspects of the organization process. These models are often expressed in the form of lists, such as the five design decisions of organizing systems, the four activities that occur in every organizing system, the four distinctions of resources, the seven steps for creating resource descriptions, and so on. These models in no way dumb down the subject matter, but they do make the material easier to understand and remember. If youre using this book as a text for a class, these models can also be helpful for writing a paper, because you can always apply one of Glushkos models to some aspect of the field youre studying, for example: Glushkos seven steps of resource description as applied to X, or the five design decisions of organizing resources as demonstrated by Y. The latter approach is employed for a series of case studies in the back of the book.As might be expected from its subject matter, The Discipline of Organizing is one of the best organized textbooks Ive ever encountered. It is systematically structured, judiciously illustrated, and intelligently designed for ease of use. The Professional Edition includes a staggering number of cross referencing links that allow the reader to explore the book in a nonlinear manner. Too often college textbooks are merely boring synthetic summaries of introductory concepts. Its refreshing to come across a text that not only takes a comprehensive look at its subject but also does so in a way thats unique, challenging, and makes original contributions to its fieldor in this case, multiple fields.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DVBAZEYU6LLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQA3Y0U#wasThisHelpful","R1DVBAZEYU6LLK","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arsne Lupin is often described as the French answer to Sherlock Holmes, and for good reason. Author Maurice Leblanc seems to have created the character in response to Sir Arthur Conan Doyles famous detective, and the stories of both share a common atmosphere and tone. The setting of the Lupin stories is slightly more modern than those of Holmesmore automobiles and fewer horses, for examplebut both series sport an entertaining combination of period chic, intellectual challenge, delightful suspense, and good-natured fun.The Extraordinary Adventures of Arsne Lupin, Gentleman-Burglar, originally published in 1907, is the first book in the Lupin series. It collects nine short stories that were originally published in the French magazine Je sais tout. The book is sometimes presented as a novel of nine chapters, but in fact each chapter functions as a stand-alone short story. Like the Holmes stories, however, it does pay to read them sequentially. Lupins debut adventure, The Arrest of Arsne Lupin, is a masterpiece. A transatlantic liner heading for America receives a telegram informing the crew that the notorious criminal is on board their vessel. This news leaks to the passengers, and everyone on board plays amateur detective, hoping to capture the infamous thief. Though I was prepared for a surprise ending, this one still managed to confound my expectations.The eight stories that follow this auspicious debut are cleverly diverse in format but inconsistent in quality. Variety is their strength, as you never know what youre going to get when you start reading one of these tales. Sometimes Lupin is a thief, planning a major heist. Other times he functions as a detective, thwarting the schemes of other criminals. Unlike Holmes, who possesses a very idiosyncratic and charismatic personality, Lupin is a chameleon. Not only is he a master at concealing his true identity, he actually has no true identity, but continually adapts himself to whatever circumstances require. Often a story proceeds for most of its length with no mention of Lupin whatsoever. At the end of the story it is revealed that this or that character was Lupin. You know its coming, but Leblanc keeps you guessing as to who its going to be.Not every story here is a winner. Seven of Hearts, the longest entry in the book, is a confusing mess involving blackmail and stolen plans for a submarine. The climactic unmasking of Lupin delivers no surprise. The Queens Necklace, on the other hand, is a classic locked-room mystery thats not only ingenious but also quite moving. The Black Pearl is another good caper in which Lupin sets out to steal the titular gem and ends up investigating a murder. In the books final story, Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late, Conan Doyles creation makes a guest appearance. Leblanc creates a mystery suitable for the master sleuth, but his take on Holmes isnt quite fitting to the character.At times Leblancs writing can get a little too cheeky as Lupin plays games with the police. I wasnt thrilled by every story in this collection, but on the whole I would say that out of the many characters inspired by Holmes, this is the first one Ive encountered thats really in the same league with Conan Doyles stories. I will certainly be checking out the further adventures of this gentleman-burglar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QEQ6TMDN9OB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01175NBL6#wasThisHelpful","R2QEQ6TMDN9OB3","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the seventh book in the ten-volume series Stories by American Authors, published by Charles Scribners Sons from 1884 to 1885. Unlike Scribners other two series, Stories by Foreign Authors and Stories by English Authors, which were sort of greatest hits collections of 19th-century authors, the American series mostly consists of upcoming authors of the period who have long since faded into obscurity. This particular collection contains one notable exception: Edward Bellamy, the author of Looking Backward, one of the three bestselling American novels of its century. Im not a great fan of that novel, but Bellamys entry here, entitled Lost, is clearly the best selection in Volume 7. An American, studying in Germany, falls in love with a local girl. When he departs for the U.S., he promises he will return someday to make her his bride. Seven years later, after having forgotten her, he wakes up and realizes that she was the love of his life. He heads back to Germany, finds her whereabouts are unknown, and begins an arduous hunt to track her down. Though the story contains its fair share of 19th-century chauvinism, the chase is exciting and it inspires readers to consider their own lost loves and missed opportunities.One thing thats surprising about the Stories by American Authors series as a whole is the attention that it pays to women authors. In Volume 7, four out of the six authors included are women. For its time, thats admirably progressive on the part of the publisher, but unfortunately none of the four included here really offer up anything memorable. Octave Thanets entry, The Bishops Vagabond is an example of a genre which often shows up in this series, in which an erudite writer condescendingly examines a member of the lower classes as if they were a guinea pig in a sociological experiment. In this case the protagonist is a poor white man from South Carolina referred to as a cracker. Kirbys Coals of Fire by Louise Stockton is similar fare, in which a theology student takes a ride on a riverboat in order to learn about the human nature of the unwashed masses. In the process, hes treated to a humorous folk tale. Margaret Floyds Passages from the Journal of a Social Wreck is an interesting piece that provides some insight into the social conventions of the period. An educated gentleman is driven by financial desperation to take a job as a professional party guest. It starts out pretty entertaining, but becomes utterly predictable by its conclusion. Rounding out the roll call of female writers is Virginia W. Johnson, whose The Image of San Donato is a rather dreary and unpleasant soap opera concerning a young girl who has a religious vision which inspires her to prevent her mother from having an affair with an Italian count.Speaking of soap operas, James T. McKay, the remaining dude in the mix, gives us a doozy with Stella Grayland. A doctor has maintained a longtime friendship with an attractive woman whom he knows to be shallow, manipulative, and perhaps even of loose morals. Yet when her father dies, leaving her without support, he marries her out of a sense of obligation. Trapped in a hellish marriage, he cant help falling in love with another woman. The result is just depressing all the way through.Overall, the Stories by American Authors series has been a disappointment, with the exception of a couple good volumes (numbers 3 and 6). I was hoping to be impressed by a few unfamiliar authors, but the relatively well-known Bellamy is the only one who stands out in this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YEPUDSI1A8NG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TOT4GO#wasThisHelpful","R1YEPUDSI1A8NG","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mummy Megapack, published in 2012, is one of many genre-specific ebook collections published by Wildside Press in their Megapacks series. Here editor John Gregory Betancourt and his team at Wildside have collected 20 stories reprinted from classic literature, the vintage pulp magazines, and even a few contemporary authors. The title and the cover image conjure up images from the golden age of mummy movies, where bandaged corpses miraculously risen from the dead would terrorize the living in their search for ancient loves or to wreak vengeance on those who dug up their tombs. Only a few of the selections included here actually fit that description. The contents are actually quite diverse. Pretty much anywhere adventure or horror fiction intersects with Egyptology is fair game. Theres even one story about an Aztec mummy, and a couple that barely mention mummies at all.The book gets off to an inauspicious start with a 1998 story from editor Betancourt, entitled Sympathy for Mummies. Its a brief and bland tale that deliberately fails to deliver the goods youd expect from this exotically titled Megapack. Luckily, this oddball offering is not indicative of the books contents as a whole. In terms of contemporary authors, Nina Kiriki Hoffman fares much better with her two 21st-century entries, The Power of Waking and Whatever Was Forgotten. The exceptional latter selection is particularly noteworthy for its narration from the mummys point of view.I expected some startling and gory tales from the pulp fiction authors. Surprisingly, however, it is the classic writers of the 19th century who really stand out from the pack. Edgar Allen Poes Some Words with a Mummy is a hilarious comic piece about some arrogant scientists opening a sarcophagus. From Louisa May Alcott, author of Little Women, comes Lost in a Pyramid, or The Mummys Curse, a chilling and expertly told tale that couldnt be more pleasantly unexpected. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle provides two talesquite possibly the two best selections in the bookThe Ring of Thoth and Lot No. 249. The former is a great archaeological thriller about the goings-on in a museum after dark, while the latter is a perfectly paced and suspenseful shocker that shows Conan Doyle at his absolute best.One of the problems with this collection, which is common to many of the Megapacks, is that presented amidst all the short stories is one novel: The Romance of a Mummy by French Romanticist Thophile Gautier. This novel takes up a third of the entire book, so whether or not you enjoy this collection largely hinges on your opinion of that one lengthy piece. The verdict on Gautiers novel is that its good, not great. It starts out as a treasure-hunting yarn, than switches to an ancient love story, then finally settles on a retelling of a familiar Biblical tale.Some of the stories included here have a tenuous connection to the mummy theme at best. Im surprised they couldnt find more thrillers and chillers like the Conan Doyle stories or romantic epics of old Egypt like Gautiers novel. Overall, however, its a pretty good collectiona couple duds and a lot of middle-of-the-road fare, but the highlights Ive enumerated above do much to compensate for the bad. Despite its shortcomings, those readers who enjoy classic adventure fiction and have an interest in Egyptian lore will find this Megapack to their liking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REZV1AF96FVMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009RR85VI#wasThisHelpful","REZV1AF96FVMH","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the years I have read several of Georges Simenons Inspector Maigret novels, but only in a haphazard order based upon whatever copies Id stumble upon in used bookstores. In November 2013, Penguin Classics began publishing new editions of all the Maigret novels, beginning with this one, giving a whole new generation of readers the opportunity to read this extensive series (75 novels in all) in their original sequence.Pietr the Latvian, originally published in 1931 under the French title of Pietr-le-Letton, is Maigrets debut. The title character is a notorious Eastern European gangster whos wanted all over the continent. As the book opens, Maigret is monitoring a series of telegrams tracking Pietrs movements across Europe as he gets closer and closer to Paris. Maigret, Detective Chief Inspector of the Flying Squad, is there to meet the train when it arrives. What he finds is unexpected: a dead body matching the description of Pietr the Latvian, apparently just murdered. However, another man is seen leaving the scene whose appearance is almost identical to that of the corpse. Which, if either, of these men is Pietr the Latvian? Just who has killed whom, and why?Compared to other Maigret cases Ive read, this is not one of my favorites. I didnt find the mystery too mysterious, and much of what is revealed at the end feels like a foregone conclusion. However, I did enjoy how Simenon develops the character of Maigret in this first book and how he establishes the dark and seedy, rain-soaked atmosphere that pervades so many of the Maigret novels. Its a refreshingly unglamorized look at the criminal underbelly of France and the workaday job of a police detective. Those expecting some sort of Maigret origin story will likely be disappointed. Simenon is always stingy with details when it comes to his hero. Theres never any complete portrait of Maigret thats clearly delineated in any one novel. Rather, choice details leak out from between the lines, and eventually over several books you start to get a sharper image of the character.Sometimes Maigret is compared to Sherlock Holmes, but such comparisons are more of magnitude than of any similarity in style or technique. Holmess cases are much more about the art of detection, while Maigrets investigative procedures often involve merely stalking his characters until they slip up. He spends much of this book waiting outside of hotels. One thing Simenon and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle do have in common, however, is their concern for the back story of the criminal. In Simenons book, the crime is often an afterthought; its the psychology of the criminal itself that matters. At the end of Pietr the Latvian, Simenon treats the exposition of criminal motive with his usual sensitivity and nuance, but I wasnt as moved by this human drama as that of other Maigret books like Lock 14 or A Mans Head.If you enjoy detective fiction you should already be reading Maigret. If not, what better place to start than where it all began? Many thanks go out to Penguin Classics for investing in a revival of Simenons classic novels, and I for one intend to support them in their efforts by reading these great books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ESD3IY5H73X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMCPOZ4#wasThisHelpful","R1ESD3IY5H73X8","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Live from New York, a behind-the-scenes history of the Saturday Night Live television series by James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales, was originally published in 2002. The latest edition, released in 2014, was timed to coincide with the shows 40th anniversary and has been updated with coverage through the programs 39th season. The book is an oral history comprised of brief bits of first-person commentary by hundreds of SNL cast members, crew, writers, hosts, and NBC network executives. The oral history approach evokes the collaborative nature of SNL and allows for the presentation of differing perspectives on events or controversies in the shows history. The drawback to this approach, unfortunately, is that it all too often amounts to dozens of people making the exact same points over and over again.Miller and Shales are attempting to accomplish two goals here: the first is to give the reader an idea of what its like to work at SNL; the second is to establish the shows place in television history. Towards the latter goal, its not surprising that much space is devoted to the formation of the show and the original cast of Not Ready for Prime Time Players. For the television historian, the endless debates over the details of the shows creation may be important, but for the casual fan the network politics can get rather dull. I understand that Lorne Michaels is the heart and soul of SNL, and likely a comedy genius, but does anyone really watch the show for Lorne? Most likely you watch the show for its cast members, and what this book doesnt do well is let the cast members voices be heard, unless theyre talking about Lorne. Writers are an important part of the show also, and its interesting to hear them talk about how certain sketches were created. Unfortunately, too many of the writers just discuss the same things over and over againhow hard it is to get stuff on the show, staying up all Tuesday night writing, and once again, Lorne. Even though everyone analyzes Lorne ad nauseam throughout the entire book, when you reach the end you get a final chapter entitled Lorne which is an absurd exercise in eulogizing the living.If youre interested in romances or feuds between cast members, theres little of that mentioned beyond whats already common knowledge. Another problem with the oral history approach is that almost everyone is reluctant to say anything bad about anyone. Theres a few cast members that everyone seems to agree were difficult, and when the topic of worst host ever comes up, the usual easy targets are mentioned. Surprises are few. Some great cast members either declined to participate (Eddie Murphy) or are barely present (Will Ferrell, Mike Myers). The best part of the book is the Kevin Nealon/Jan Hooks/Phil Hartman years through the Sandler/Farley/Spade/Rock era, because thats when you get the most cast input and the best idea of how much fun it is to put the show together. Surprisingly, an inordinate amount of time is devoted to the very recent years of the show, with a lot of unnecessary congratulatory back-slapping. From the way praise is heaped on Andy Sambergs juvenile music videos, youd think he were the next Fellini.Fifty years from now, television historians are going to consider this book a valuable documentary record of the history of SNL. For the fan, however, it can be a colossal bore. Its so easy, even addictive, to just read the next little tidbit, but at the end of twenty minutes you realize youve just heard forty people say the same thing, and you wonder why you wasted your time. If you can find this book cheap, get it, but just look up the passages concerning your favorite cast members. To read the whole thing is a disappointing and mind-numbing experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IA9VMS1H2CBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316295043#wasThisHelpful","R2IA9VMS1H2CBM","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thophile Gautiers novel The Romance of a Mummy was originally published in 1858 under the French title Le Roman de La Momie. Though the word roman translates literally into novel, to call this story a romance is certainly no misnomer. Gautier was a staunch Romanticist, and the book prominently features a love story, so the term is accurate in both senses of the word. Like many 19th-century French Romanticists, Gautier was fascinated by exotic locales and cultures. Egypt was one of his many travel destinations and a source of inspiration for at least a few of his writings, including short stories like The Mummys Foot and One of Cleopatras Nights.The Romance of a Mummy opens in the nineteenth century. Two English gentlemen, an Egyptologist and a wealthy aristocrat, set out to discover an undiscovered tomb. With unbelievable luck, they hit the jackpot right away and are soon exploring the passageways of a man-made tunnel system that has been sealed for thousands of years. After this prologue, the story not surprisingly flashes back a couple millennia to recount the life story of the entombed, who lived during the time of Moses. Gautier takes us to Thebes and immediately gives us four complete chapters of nothing but description. Every aspect of the architecture, clothing, furniture, decoration and customs of the Egyptians is spelled out for the reader in loving detail. In Gautiers time, this brand of heavy description would have been equivalent to the set design of a Hollywood blockbuster. Todays readers, however, with so many images of ancient Egypt at our disposal, might find all this visual detail somewhat unnecessary and boring. Nevertheless, one cant help admiring Gautier for his depth of research and his exceptional skill for painting vivid pictures with words.Once the actual narrative gets underway, its really very engaging. Though its a highly romanticized tale, the detachment from reality doesnt hinder ones ability to relate to the characters and empathize with their loves and losses. Gautiers skilled plotting really kept me wondering what would happen next. The book disappoints in its final few chapters, however, when it starts to relate an episode from the Bible that almost every reader will be familiar with. Gautiers retelling of this well known story is quite exciting and eloquent at times. Still, once you realize where the narrative is headed, any chance of unpredictability has been removed. I was just becoming involved with Gautiers characters and wished he would have crafted an original story around them. Instead, his choice to end the book with a rehashing of an ancient legend feels like a bit of a cheat.Gautier was a great writer by 19th-century standards, but 19th-century standards dont always translate into 21st-century reading enjoyment. The Romance of a Mummy likely thrilled the audience of its day, but todays readers may find the story a bit too commonplace despite its exotic subject matter. Even so, if you have a fascination with ancient Egypt and you appreciate good, old-fashioned storytelling, give it a try and spend a few hours along the banks of the Nile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO9C0PRGLTRF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TQGZR8#wasThisHelpful","RO9C0PRGLTRF6","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Washington: A Life, a biography of George Washington by Ron Chernow, was published in 2010. It won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Biography. Washington is a legendary figure whose life encompassed enough adventures, accomplishments, and anecdotes to fill a whole shelf full of books. To cram this mans life into one volume is an ambitious and challenging undertaking, but Chernow pulls it off in excellent fashion. In 67 chapters, he follows the arc of Washingtons fascinating lifehis youth on a Virginia plantation, his forays into the western wilderness as a surveyor, his military exploits in the French and Indian Wars, his home life as a planter at Mount Vernon, his leadership of the Continental Army in the American Revolution, his participation in the Constitutional Convention, his two terms as President of the United States, and his retirement as a living legend.The book is not merely a laundry list of Washingtons achievements, however. The popular image of Washington that pervades American culture is that of a stone-faced statue who could do no wrong. Chernow cuts through the myths and finally shows us Washington as a human being with imperfections, personality quirks, and insecurities. When I first started reading the book, phrases like superhuman strength made me worry that I was in for a typical adulation fest, but Chernow soon laid those fears to rest. Rest assured, the book contains a satisfying amount of hero worship where appropriate, but overall Chernows balanced approach gives a full, rich picture of the man behind the figurehead. He gives Washington credit where credit is due, but doesnt let him off the hook when he acts unethically or in error. One area where Chernow is particularly thorough is on the subject of slavery. Washington often expressed a desire to abolish slavery, yet he himself was a slaveholder, and in some cases not a particularly lenient one. Chernow explains Washingtons conflicting attitudes toward slavery without making excuses for him.This biography is full of surprises and really allows the reader to view Washington in a different light. Instead of the silent stoic, we see a charming man who loved to dance and flirt with the ladies. Though he owned an incredible amount of land, Washington was constantly cash-poor. While he was revered by the public as almost a god during his lifetime, his politics were mercilessly attacked by his rivals, led by Thomas Jefferson. The latter is part of a supporting cast of luminaries that are also covered in detail. Chernow not only paints an intricate portrait of Washington, he also provides a vivid, panoramic view into this fascinating period in American history.Really the only criticism I could come up with against Chernows book is its length. At times reading it felt like a monumental undertaking, but I can honestly say that it never bored me. Chernows prose is perfect. He can take complex matters like Revolutionary troop movements and early-republic policy debates and render them totally clear and understandable to the general reader, yet he doesnt dumb down the language or the ideas. He has the rare knack for summarizing without oversimplifying. This book is truly a remarkable work of research and synthesis. The sheer quantity of sources Chernow must have had to wade through to compile this biography is staggering. Im neither a historian nor a Washington scholar, so Im in no position to quibble with any of Chernows findings. From the perspective of a general reader whos always been fascinated by the mysterious Father of Our Country, however, this one-volume, cradle-to-the-grave biography not only satisfied my curiosity but also far exceeded my expectations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HJMH2JG0B7ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143119966#wasThisHelpful","R2HJMH2JG0B7ZJ","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Gods Are Athirst, a novel by Nobel Prize winner Anatole France, was originally published in 1912 under the French title of Les dieux ont soif. The story takes place from 1793 to 1794, during the period of the French Revolution known as The Terror. variste Gamelin is a young painter actively involved in the local political activities of his neighborhood. His enthusiasm for the Republican cause is duly noted, and he is appointed to the office of juror on the Revolutionary Tribunal. The Jacobins are rounding up former aristocrats and anyone else who might sympathize with the former king. These offenders are corralled into the courtroom for cursory show trials, wherein Gamelin and his fellow jurors pass judgment upon them, the usual sentence being death by guillotine. Gamelin is fiercely devoted to the Republican doctrine and practically worships the Jacobin leaders Marat and Robespierre. As his judicial office slowly transforms him from an earnest, likeable young man to a cold, merciless executioner, his family and friends begin to fear him, wary they might be next on the chopping block.I usually think of France as a satirist, but in this historical novel hes deadly serious. He does, however, contrast Gamelin with the character of Maurice Brotteaux, a former aristocrat who looks askance at the Republican rhetoric with an irreverent viewpoint and humorous sense of the ironic that one might expect from the author. France wrote this book for an audience of his fellow Frenchman, so the reader is expected to come armed with a prior knowledge of the Revolution. For the American reader, it can be tough going at times. France defines his characters by listing off the surnames of the politicians, philosophers, and artists they subscribe to, which can result in passages that read like a Parisian phone book. Its not quite as confusing as Victor Hugos novel of the Revolution, Ninety-Three, but its neither as exciting nor as inspiring either. Frances takes on the period is more realistic and less heroic than Hugos, yet The Gods Are Athirst still presents a romantic tale that somewhat resembles a tragic opera.France does a good job of evoking the atmosphere of paranoia and persecution that must have pervaded Paris under the Terror. Beyond its conveyance of time and place, however, the story is less than satisfying. Its hard to become emotionally involved in a novel when you dont care for the hero, and from early on it becomes difficult to root for Gamelin. The supporting cast, with the possible exception of Brotteaux, are underdeveloped. They all sort of orbit around Gamelin, but none of them ever steps up to challenge him as the focus of attention. There are some compelling moments around the books mid-point, but the first half crawls, and the ending is a foregone conclusion.While the dramatic potential of the French Revolution is undeniable, The Gods Are Athirst never takes full advantage of that potential. The result is more educational than moving. Ultimately this is one historical novel where the history outshines the novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R224NTLJ1YK7I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KT767L0#wasThisHelpful","R224NTLJ1YK7I6","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently began a masters program in library and information science, and for the first time in my life I have been required to write in APA style. I am therefore unfamiliar with the previous five editions of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association and can only comment on the Sixth Edition, published in 2009. I have worked in book publishing for many years and have some familiarity with the Chicago Manual of Style (CMS), which is used more frequently in humanities writing, as opposed to APA style, which predominates in the social sciences. Both styles serve their purposes, and Im not here to compare the two or to critique APA style, but I am here to critique this book. For a first-time grad student trying to teach himself this new way of writing, this manual is not a very user-friendly guide.The book is crammed with a lot of good information, but theres also quite a bit thats missing. For example, starting at the most basic level, should there be one space or two spaces after an end-of-sentence period? You wont find the answer in this book, or at least the index doesnt reference it. An online search will yield either answer. One professor told me it doesnt matter, as long as youre consistent. Should there be a comma before et al.? Youll see it both with and without the comma on page 175, with no satisfying explanation as to the reason for the discrepancy. Ambiguity is not exactly a good thing in a style guide. Like the rules of a game, all the parameters should be spelled out and idiot-proofed.One thing about the book thats very helpful is the way it displays information in charts, tables, and illustrated examples. It shows a couple of sample papers, judiciously highlighted with references to relevant passages in the manual. Easy-to-read tables clearly demonstrate levels of heading and basic citation styles. The chapter on Displaying Results includes numerous helpful and practical examples of charts and figures. The section entitled Reference Examples is organized logically according to source categories. Still, I often came across cases that werent covered. For example, how do you cite a Kindle book that uses location numbers instead of page numbers? For that, I had to resort to Google for a solution. In fact, more often than not I ended up finding the answers to my style questions through Google rather than through this book. Theres a whole online community out there devoted to handling the situations this manual doesnt cover, which calls into question its true value as a reference.Some may argue that you couldnt possibly answer every question and cover every possible circumstance within the covers of a printed book. Thats true, but the CMS comes closer to serving as a truly comprehensive reference than this book does. If the Publication Manual needs to be twice as thick, then it should be twice as thick. If you are writing in a field that requires APA style, youre going to have to buy the book anyway, regardless of cost, so it might as well do the job and do it thoroughly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHY897RYBN9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433805618#wasThisHelpful","R1GHY897RYBN9B","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was a required text in my first semester of grad school in library and information science (LIS). I found the 2008 edition of Practical Research Methods for Librarians and Information Professionals by Susan E. Beck and Kate Manuel to be a very informative and thorough examination of its topic. It provides a detailed and comprehensive overview of various research methodologies available to LIS professionals. The book opens by describing the research process in general, then in subsequent chapters shows how that process plays out in the use of different research techniques including content analysis, interviews and focus groups, observation and usability studies, experimental research, bibliometrics, action research, and classroom research.The book is not an easy read, but its worth the trouble. Beck and Manuel write more for precision than for clarity. They say a lot and they say it concisely. Oftentimes this results in sentences that are so packed with detail that they may require two or three readings to unravel. This is clearly a book meant to educate rather than to entertain, yet readers cant help but acquire an enthusiasm for research when confronted by the myriad possibilities that Beck and Manuel open up to them. Each chapter is loaded with concrete examples of existing library and information studies, as well as practical suggestions for further study. Though the text may be dense and dry at times, the consistent organization of each chapter, coupled with well-planned figures and tables, makes the book a user-friendly reference and allows for easy comparing and contrasting of the advantages, shortcomings, and processes of different research methodologies.For the LIS student, Beck and Manuel provide a great introduction on how to conduct research at a professional level. For the LIS professional, this book may open your eyes to new methodologies or topics for study. It will also no doubt serve as a valuable reference for any researcher, essentially serving as an exhaustive step-by-step cheat sheet of what steps to follow and what pitfalls to avoid. The book cant cover everything. You wont get a comprehensive course in statistics, for example, and for some topics like sampling methods or the ethical obligations of working with human subjects researchers will likely have to seek out more targeted sources. For topics they cant cover comprehensively, Beck and Manuel often offer helpful recommendations for further reading. If youre looking for a one-volume manual on how to conduct research, devoted exclusively to applications in library and information science, it would be hard to find a better text than this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R48WZ6JW6SH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UBD6DO#wasThisHelpful","R3R48WZ6JW6SH5","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many earthlings, Ronny Bronston dreams of going into space. When he scores a job interview with the government of the United Planets, he sees a chance for his dream to become reality. At this unspecified point in the distant future, mankind has emigrated to thousands of new planets. So far no other intelligent life forms have been discovered in space, but over centuries mankind has developed a staggering array of cultures, governments, and religions. Every splinter group and fringe element has fled the mother planet to found their own world. The United Planets, headquartered on Earth, is the government that unites all humanoid life wherever it may reside. Articles One and Two of the UP Charter assert that neither the UP administration nor another member planet may interfere with the political, religious, or socioeconomic development of any member world. Bronston is hired into the mysterious Section G of the United Planets Bureau of Investigation, whose mission it is to enforce these most sacred precepts. A mysterious revolutionary, nicknamed Tommy Paine, has been hopping from world to world, inspiring political revolutions, economic chaos, and religious conflict. Bronstons first assignment is to track down this galactic troublemaker and put a stop to his world-changing mischief.Ultima Thule, a novella by Mack Reynolds, was originally published in the March 1961 issue of the pulp magazine Analog Science Fiction and Fact. Reynolds often wrote futuristic works in which he explored political themes. As Bronston chases after Paine, Reynolds has the opportunity to delve deeply into the political and social environments of three or four different UP member planets. Given their diversity, its difficult to determine what overarching point hes trying to make, if any, until the final chapter. The ending of the book is really quite good. Unfortunately, all that comes before it is a bit of a bore. Reading about the structure and workings of the United Planets is about as much fun as perusing an institutional history of any other bureaucracy. H. Beam Piper, one of Reynoldss contemporaries, also frequently satirizes governmental agencies, but he manages to slip in enough humorous touches and far-out sci-fi gadgets to keep things interesting. Reynolds puts so much effort into making his world seem real that it turns out being too real, and therefore not much fun. Despite the intergalactic travel, Bronstons investigation is still mainly just a series of over-the-desk interviews. The trail of clues he follows in pursuit of his man is a convoluted line of reasoning that I neither could nor really wanted to follow.Despite such complaints, the eye-opening final chapter really does compensate for a lot of the books shortcomings. Reynolds makes some truly interesting points, but one wishes he didnt take such a circuitous route to get there. In regards to the quality of Reynoldss work in general, Im on the fence. Ive read a few of his stories that I really liked (e.g. The Business, as Usual and Compounded Interest) and a couple of novellas that left me ambivalent (Status Quo, and this one). With such a hit-and-miss record, Im inclined to stick with Piper, who more consistently and reliably satisfies and exceeds expectations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35AL6ND02OQXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TROWO0#wasThisHelpful","R35AL6ND02OQXC","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Marrow of Tradition, originally published in 1901, is a novel by Charles W. Chesnutt, an author of mixed African and European ancestry who often wrote about racial issues in the American South. This book is set in Wellington, a fictional surrogate for Wilmington, NC. It is based on an actual event that occurred there in 1898 which has been alternately referred to by different parties as an insurrection, a coup detat, a massacre, and a race riot.Olivia Carteret is the wife of Major Carteret, publisher of the town newspaper. When her mother died, Olivias father became involved with one of his black servants, resulting in a second daughter, Janet. Olivia considers her mulatto half sister to be a stain on her good name, yet she also secretly envies Janets happiness and success. Janet is married to William Miller, a respected black doctor educated in Europe, who has established a hospital to serve the communitys black population. Many of the towns white citizens, some of whom still remember the days of slavery, are uncomfortable with the rising fortunes and strides toward equality made by their black neighbors. Major Carteret, a white supremacist, feels that the black folks need a reminder of their proper place in Southern society. He and a couple of like-minded associates start a propaganda campaign to promote their pro-white agenda in an attempt to oust the local black-friendly political party from power.Stylistically, Chesnutt was a naturalist, and he depicts Southern society with unflinching clarity. He illustrates the tense relations between the black and white races through a series of discriminatory acts. For starters, Dr. Miller is kicked out of a white train car, then denied access to a medical procedure. Chesnutt also depicts the working lives of lower class blackslaborers and servantswho are treated with insulting condescension and threatening disdain by their white employers and customers. Beatings and lynchings are still a threat for those who dont toe the line. As the story proceeds, the racial unrest intensifies and the incidents of white antagonism toward the blacks escalates from unjust discrimination to violent persecution. This is by no means a simple us vs. them story, however. A large cast of characters and a wide array of subplots allows for Chesnutt to explore a variety of motives and perspectives, presenting a black and white society blurred by shades of gray. In contrast to Major Carterets cronies, some whites sympathize with the plight of the blacks. Among the black men, some are like caged prisoners ready to strike at their captors, while others are compliant subjects resigned to the perceived inevitability of their second-class citizenship. Chesnutt explores class issues as well as race. One of the white supremacists, Captain McBane, represents uppity white trash, despised by the aristocratic Major Carteret for his lack of breeding. Conversely, Dr. Miller is resented by whites for displaying admirable gentility in spite of his African pedigree.Amidst the generally realistic discussion of such serious fare, Chesnutt mixes in a fair amount of soap opera melodrama. For example, a young white woman is courted by two white suitorsone a wealthy, rakish cad; the other an earnest, hardworking underdog. Given the era of the books publication, such frivolities can be forgiven. If written today, the narrative would no doubt be darker and grittier. Overall, however, The Marrow of Tradition is an eye-opening history lesson thats remarkably frank for its time. The reader comes away with an admiration for Chesnutts brave forthrightness as well as his formidable skills as a novelist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXQSEWZ055XC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00849BWMO#wasThisHelpful","RXQSEWZ055XC1","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"James Hiltons novel Lost Horizon, published in 1933, was one of the most popular and bestselling books of the 20th century. It tells the utopian tale of a secret civilization hidden away in the mountains of Tibet. The narrative is bookended by a conversation between two Oxford alumni discussing an esteemed former classmate of theirs, Glory Conway. Conway is working as a diplomat for the British government in India when an uprising forces him to evacuate all white residents from the town where he is stationed. The plane on which he himself escapes, accompanied by three fellow passengers, makes an unscheduled landing deep within the mountainous terrain of Tibet. There the aerial castaways are greeted by a Chinese man named Chang, who leads them to a lamasery nestled within the majestic mountain crags overlooking an idyllic valley. Despite its extremely remote location, this mysterious lamasery, dubbed Shangri-La, is equipped with modern comforts and cultural artifacts from all over the world. Its lamas live a serene and cerebral existence, devoting their time to study, contemplation, and music. Though they are eager to return to civilization, the four foreign guests are informed that it will take some time to make arrangements for their safe departure, so they resign themselves, not altogether reluctantly, to an extended stay in paradise.The first criteria for judging any utopian novel is whether or not you would really want to live in the utopia in question, or at least settle down for a prolonged visit. As far as Shangri-La is concerned, count me in. The problem with Lost Horizon, however, is that the story that Hilton builds around this utopia just doesnt do justice to his fascinating creation. The setting far outshines the plot. Like many a utopian or lost civilization story, it takes half the book to get to Shangri-La in the first place, and once youre there, the action is as sparse as the oxygen in the Himalayan air. The book does have its suspenseful moments, but every time the reader feels like the story is about to take off, Hilton brings the momentum to a dead halt in order to psychoanalyze Conway. Instead of reading descriptions of Conways laziness, indolence, passionlessnesswhatever you want to call itfor countless page after page, I would have appreciated it if Hilton had illustrated his heros psychology through his actions. On the other hand, while Conways every twitch of eyebrow is examined ad nauseam, his three fellow passengers are almost as simply drawn as cartoon characters, including an American who says things like pi-anno (I guess we Yanks should be thankful that the o wasnt traded for a y.) Most egregious of all is that the whole book hinges on a choice that Conway must make, yet the outcome of that choice was already revealed in the prologue.Conway is an embodiment of the shell-shocked angst and careworn apathy of modern man as he emerged from the horrors of World War I. He has witnessed mankind at its worst, yet he foresees an even more terrible war, perhaps even an Armageddon, looming on the horizon. This encapsulation of the mindset between the two World Wars reminded me of another utopian novel, Hermann Hesses The Glass Bead Game, which shares many of the same faults as Hiltons book. Both authors caution against humanitys burying its head in the sand, no matter how attractive that proposition may be. Todays reader is grateful for the historical perspective, but would much prefer to get lost in the intriguing mysteries of Shangri-La, if only Hilton would let him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10UMR91D00A7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JCZGOC#wasThisHelpful","R10UMR91D00A7W","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my first semester of graduate school I used Richard W. Seversons book The Principles of Information Ethics as a supplemental text in a library and information sciences course. Published in 1997, it is a small book and relatively brief at 144 pages, but what it covers it covers well. The book is organized according to Seversons Four Principles of Information Ethics: respect for intellectual property, respect for privacy, fair representation, and nonmaleficence (or doing no harm). These principles can be used within a Four Step Method of Principled Ethics, which provides a framework for assessing and resolving ethical dilemmas. Severson outlines a well conceived and user-friendly process of weighing the pros and cons of an ethical argument to reach a satisfying resolution.The title of the book makes it sound broader in scope than it really is. This book doesnt cover all aspects of information ethics. Rather, it focuses exclusively on issues relating to digital technology. For example, in the subject on privacy, Severson discusses the collection of personal data from customers and patrons, as well as email privacy, but he doesnt really get into the ethics of whether people should have the right to read what they want to read. The phrase intellectual freedom is never mentioned, and the book came out before the USA PATRIOT Act, so theres no discussion of the government requesting patron borrowing records. The section on intellectual property does not provide a comprehensive overview of copyright. It bypasses print copyright entirely to focus on topics specific to computer technology, like software patents and digital piracy. This narrowness in scope need not be considered a shortcoming. As long as you know what youre getting before you buy the book, its perfectly fine. On the other hand, if youre looking for a book that casts a wider net on the subject, try Case Studies in Library and Information Science Ethics by Elizabeth A. Buchanan and Kathrine A. Henderson.Seversons writing is crystal clear and free of jargon throughout. His reasoning is thorough and astute, but easy to follow. Hes one of those rare authors who can discuss complex philosophical principles in a straightforward conversational tone without dumbing down the subject matter. The Principles of Information Ethics offers plenty of food for thought on ethical issues in the Digital age and provides practical decision-making guidance for information professionals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKNQ5MBNZB1C3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1563249588#wasThisHelpful","RKNQ5MBNZB1C3","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Black Robe, a historical novel by Irish-Canadian author Brian Moore, was originally published in 1985. It is set in the 16th century in what is now Canada. Years ago I saw the excellent 1991 film adaptation, directed by Bruce Beresford, so when I stumbled upon a copy of the novel in a discount bookstore I immediately snatched it up. I am glad I did, because this is a fantastic book.Father Paul Laforgue is a Jesuit missionary from France who has come to Quebec to help convert the godless natives whom the French refer to as Savages. The Jesuit brotherhood receives a report from a remote mission in the country of the Huron Indians. One of their Fathers has fallen ill, and a replacement is required. Laforgue volunteers for the job, and after permission is granted by Governor Champlain he sets off on his journey, accompanied by a young Frenchman named Daniel and guided by a band of Algonkin Indians. Not only does Laforgue find the conditions of wilderness travel harsh and exhausting, he is also unprepared for life among the Algonkins. He finds their personal habits filthy, their sexual licentiousness disturbing, and their superstitious beliefs abhorrent. The two cultures are literally worlds apart. The Jesuits consider the natives barbaric, while the Indians think the priests, or Black Robes, are evil sorcerers. Laforgue tries to convince the Algonkins that life on Earth is merely preparation for the paradise of afterlife. They, on the other hand, prefer earthly life to the dark world of night that awaits them after death. Laforgue wants to baptize them to save their souls, but they think the watery sorcery is an evil trick meant to kill them. Their fear and antagonism of Laforgue threatens his own life, and the hardships he faces on the journey cause the Jesuit to question his vocation and his faith.Although the subject matter of the book is of a religious nature, this is by no means intended to be an inspirational novel for Christian readers. In fact, members of that demographic may take umbrage at some of what Moore has to say about the church. This is the story of one man undergoing a crisis of faith and a crisis of conscience. Mans relationship with his god is examined from all angles, incorporating viewpoints both devout and skeptical. It neither promotes nor refutes dogma, but definitely provides food for thought.Moores depiction of the Canadian aborigines is unromanticized and not entirely positive. They are self-interested opportunists who will steal and kill when it suits them. However, they are also complex, intelligent people who value a sense of humor. Even in the darkest of moments, they can be seen laughing, joking, and mocking the French. Their culture, manners, and mores are presented matter-of-factly, without judgment. Moore totally immerses the reader in the 16th century, but he wisely departs from period veracity in one crucial way. When the Indians curse, it is 20th-century profanity that springs forth from their mouths. This anachronism makes it easier for the modern reader to identify with them, despite the chronological distance and culture clash.Black Robe often resembles a James Fenimore Cooper novel thats been updated with realistic sex, violence, and profanity.

"Mack Reynolds (a.k.a. Dallas McCord Reynolds) was a popular American science fiction writer who was active from the 1950s until his death in 1983. His novella Status Quo was originally published in the August 1961 issue of the pulp magazine Analog Science Fact and Fiction. I had previously read a couple of Reynoldss short storiesThe Business, As Usual and Compounded Interest, included in Wildside Presss Second Time Travel Megapackand found them remarkably creative and delightfully unconventional. Wanting to explore more of this intriguing authors work, I arbitrarily chose Status Quo from among the Reynolds titles available for free download. This particular work, however, turned out not to be such a wise choice.The story is set in the near future, probably around the 1970s, yet there are already flying cars, hover-cabs, and TriD television. Lawrence Woolford works for a U.S. government agency referred to only as the department which handles matters of intelligence and national security. Larry is called into his bosss office and presented with a $50 bill. The money is neither a gift nor a bonus, but evidence in an ongoing investigation. Someone has been passing counterfeit notes, so perfect that they are indistinguishable from real money but for the use of duplicate serial numbers. Though normally counterfeiting falls under the jurisdiction of the Secret Service, there is concern that the Russians may be producing these phony bills in an attempt to destabilize the American economy. The chief assigns Woolford to investigate the matter. He soon discovers that a noted Soviet spy has recently entered the U.S. Suspecting this Russian agent may be behind the counterfeiting plot, Woolford sets out to track him down.The America that Reynolds creates in Status Quo is an exaggerated parody of Cold War paranoia. It also satirizes a society absolutely obsessed with status symbols. Woolford makes a decent living as a g-man, but hes in debt from keeping up with the Joneses. He must drive the right car, wear the right clothes, fill his home with the proper furnishings, or else he will be branded as a weird, or nonconformist. Reynolds broadens this obsession with status to include what he calls social labels. He asserts that when it comes to making decisions about who to employ, who to do business with, or who to place in positions of authority, we place far more emphasis on social labelsthe aforementioned status symbols, for example, or where someone went to school, their familial or socioeconomic background, or the degrees they holdthan on competency, intelligence, or integrity. Reynolds seems to be advocating that we replace this unfair and inefficient system with a meritocracy in which everyone succeeds according to his or her capabilities. The problem with Reynoldss cultural criticism is that his definition of social labels is way to broad. Does anyone really consider an MD or a PhD to be nothing more than a status symbol? In Reynoldss meritocratic utopia, occupational experience would be worthless. Everyone must be solely judged on their present competency, but how would such judgments be made, and by whom?The mystery of the counterfeiting plot is well-thought out, and there are a few fun surprises along the way. The ending of the story is particularly good, but getting there is often a dull ride. Status Quo is about three times longer than it needs to be. Despite my dissatisfaction with this novella, however, I still plan to seek out more work by Reynolds. Even amid the tedious plot and misguided message of this failed experiment, his lovably weird imagination shines through.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR80EJ3XUKYAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TROXR6#wasThisHelpful","RR80EJ3XUKYAM","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Willa Cathers novel My ntonia was originally published in 1918. It is the final novel in her Prairie Trilogy, following O Pioneers! and The Song of the Lark. Since the three books dont share any common characters or setting, the designation of trilogy is questionable, so dont feel like you have to read either of those preceding volumes in order to enjoy this book.My ntonia is set in and around the fictional town of Black Hawk, Nebraska. The story is narrated by Jim Burden, an attorney, who recalls memories of his boyhood, in particular his friendship with a girl named ntonia Shimerda. Jim loses his parents at the age of ten, and moves from Virginia to Nebraska to live on his grandparents farm. On the train out West he encounters the Shimerda family, just arrived from Bohemia, who turn out to be his new neighbors. The Shimerdas are a proud and hardworking family, but they dont take readily to farming the prairie, and they eke out a poor existence form their land. The Burdens befriend the Bohemian family and offer them as much help as they can, but the two families dont always see eye to eye.Jim and his grandparents eventually move into the town of Black Hawk. ntonia is not far behind, for like many immigrant farm girls, she takes a job in town as a household servant and once again becomes Jims neighbor. Because the immigrant families dont speak the language as well as the native-born residents of Black Hawk, they are treated as second-class citizens. No American boy would ever consider marrying one of these Norwegian or Bohemian hired girls, yet that doesnt lessen their attraction. Having been raised in the country, ntonia and her foreign friends are more free-spirited than their city-bred counterparts, with no inhibitions about socializing or dancing with men. Thus these girls are branded as bad girls by the gossips of the town, whether they deserve such a reputation or not.In plain-spoken but poetic prose, Cather brilliantly depicts both the pleasures and pains of growing up in small-town middle America. Jims recollection of youth includes many nostalgic joys, but its not all sunshine and roses. When Cather shows the negative aspects of Black Hawkits insularity, its conventionality, its narrow-mindednessshe does so in a matter-of-fact way thats free of condescension or cynicism. The relationship between Jim and ntonia is fascinating to watch as it progresses, but the supporting cast is equally well-drawn and engaging. Even when Cather goes off on a tangent to examine some of these minor characters, the result is fascinating. The story of Peter and Pavel is a tour de force, and ought to be excerpted and inserted into every high school literature textbook. The books final act is a little weak and unimpressive compared to all that came before, yet overall My ntonia is a masterpiece of American naturalist literature. Cather finds real epic drama in the everyday lives of ordinary people as they try to make a life for themselves in this isolated hamlet on the Great Plains. If you grew up in a small town or rural area, My ntonia will make you consider your own life and times, and how the people and places you knew in your childhood shaped the person you are today.My ntonia is generally considered Cathers greatest work, though I think its a toss-up between this and O Pioneers! The first and third books in the Prairie Trilogy are both excellent, while the middle volume, The Song of the Lark, is clearly the weak link in the chain and a poor fit with the other two in terms of style and subject matter. For any fan of classic literature looking for that Great American Novel, My ntonia is a must-read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KNIH991FB1Q9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083ZCCQE#wasThisHelpful","R3KNIH991FB1Q9","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection of short stories was originally published as one of the Little Blue Books, an immensely popular series produced mostly in the 1920s and 30s by Emmanuel Haldeman-Julius, a radical publisher based in southeastern Kansas who made it his personal mission to educate the masses (while making money, of course). Haldeman-Julius, sometimes referred to as the Henry Ford of Literature, published thousands of titles in the series and sold hundreds of millions of copies. These small, brief, and inexpensive books spanned subjects as diverse as fiction, philosophy, science, history, and sex ed. First Love, volume number 1195 in the series, focuses on Spanish literature and features five short stories amounting to about 64 pages of text. It is one of the very few Little Blue Books that are now available as public domain ebooks at Amazon and Project Gutenberg.The book opens with its title selection, First Love by Emilia Pardo Bazan. Likely the best entry in the volume, its the story of a boy falling in love for the first time, not with a person but with a portrait. Mariquita the Bald by Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch is an O. Henry-esque fable about a beautiful woman who is incredibly vain with regards to her thick and lustrous hair. The Love of Clotilde by Armando Palacio Valds concerns an actresss love affair with a playwright. Two shorter selections, An Andalusian Duel by Serafin Estebanez Calderon and Captain Venenos Proposal of Marriage by Pedro Antonio de Alarcn are so brief they amount to little more than jokes, and to summarize them would be to reveal half their contents. What these five stories have in common is that theyre all love stories, they all possess the flavor of Balzacs more lighthearted offerings, and theyre all pleasantly predictable. The only one that really offers anything in the way of surprises is the Hartzenbusch entry. If you like 19th-century literature, then predictability shouldnt necessarily be a deal-breaker. Though the stories may not be Fascinating as the title indicates, they do offer a refreshing glimpse into Spanish Life.With the exception of Don Quixote and perhaps a few 20th-century Nobel laureates, Spanish literature (from Spain, not Latin America) is generally unknown to most English-language readers. We just dont see the abundance of translations that one finds with French, German, or Russian literature, particularly for 19th-century fiction. Another collection thats available for free download is the Spanish volume of the Stories by Foreign Authors series, published by Charles Scribners Sons in 1898. It includes two better works by Pedro Antonio de Alarcn. The quality overall is about on a par with this one, but the stories are lengthier and a little more literary. The pieces included in First Love are oriented toward a broader popular audience.As for the Little Blue Books series, hopefully more will be digitized and distributed as ebooks. I find Haldeman-Juliuss grand enterprise fascinating, and count myself among the masses longing to be educated by his nickel-a-volume wisdom.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CSQQQOHZVI9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084A10RU#wasThisHelpful","R3CSQQQOHZVI9Y","A3QN1SJPR6L552","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QN1SJPR6L552?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Anker's MFi certified Lightning charge cable is designed to work with all of Apples latest iPhone, iPad, and iPod products using the latest standard charge port. The Lightning cable itself comes in an extensive 10ft length, for those who'd prefer having that longer reach to connect their Apple device to a far-away computer USB port, USB wall charger, or external battery without having to ""hug the wall"". The cables material and kevlar construction also appears to be sturdy, flexible, and well-made, giving off the feeling that this will last me until my next phone update.This is labelled as an MFi certified Apple Lightning cable and I have not experienced any ""not supported"" error message when using this cable with my iPhone so far.Sure, it's no USB 3.0 standard, but not even Apple has officially announced device support for it at this point.

"Geega's LED lamp was a lot bigger than I had initially expected. Setting up was simple and straightforward.The white lamp consists primarily of glossy plastic material and has a fairly minimal and simple design. The angles of the LED bar can be swiveled and readjusted for the ideal light coverage setting. At the base of the unit, there is a touch-sensitive power button, as well as a brightness level bar used to adjust how bright I want the lamp to be. And the LED lamp is definitely bright at the max setting. I found the brightness level at about 60% to be perfectly acceptable in illuminating my bedroom at night as I'm surfing the web on my tablet or reading a book.Unlike similar LED lamp models by other manufacturers, however, there are no additional adjustments for custom light tone and warmth setting. For those who don't care about this, it just means there's less buttons to press on the stand base. As all of the lamp's controls are touch-sensitive and flush with the base, I did have to visibly see the lamp's base to identify where to . For the most part, I had to visibly reach out to the specific one.What Geega's lamp does have is a standard 5V/2A USB charge port that I use to recharge my smartphone or tablet.A standard AC wall charger is used to keep the LED lamp charged.Overall, in terms of the products build quality and versatility, I am pleased with its performance and will give it a 5/5 stars without a second thought.I was provided a product free of charge in order to provide an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R121DDPWVC4WPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VWGFT6#wasThisHelpful","R121DDPWVC4WPB","A193QU46RWDQ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A193QU46RWDQ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EasyAcc's set of micro-USB 2.0 charge cables came in varying lengths that are suitable for a wide variety of situations. This includes one 6ft, two 3ft, and two 1ft. The longer 6ft cable is perfect for longer range charging from my laptop, game console, or USB wall charger. 3ft is the most standard length of the set.The advantage of the shorter 1ft length cables include being less prone to tangling or getting caught in things. For example, when I often charge my Android device using a portable battery, the original cable (at 3 feet length) is often overkill and a lot of it just sticks out of my jacket pocket, vulnerable to being caught and hooked to things. I almost dropped my phone one time because of this. Having a mere 1 feet charge cable helps in this case. Being shorter also means its more manageable and easier to store. I keep this in the smallest compartment in my backpack as backup, as micro-USB is such a common standard and is compatible with so many things.So far, I have not experienced any ""not supported"" error message when using this cable with my micro-USB devices with any of the charging sources, including USB wall chargers, laptop USB port, and external battery. Even my PlayStation 4's DualShock 4 controller, which is extremely picky when it comes to charging cable, fully works with EasyAcc's cable set. Charging rate and speed is also very similar to my other micro-USB charge-only cables.The one downside to these cables is that there's no data transfer functionality, as they are designed with ONLY charging in mind.Overall, a set of micro-USB charge cable with solid performance that I can leave in places or take with me when I'm out. I'd keep one at home, one at work, one in my car's glove compartment, one in my bag, etc.I was provided a product free of charge in order to provide an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJ7X97HRQ6RV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JL1490G#wasThisHelpful","RJJ7X97HRQ6RV","A193QU46RWDQ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A193QU46RWDQ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These wired headphones serve as great replacement to my previous in-ear headphones. The SoundPEATS B-10 package also includes 3 sets of interchangeable soft earbuds to choose from, which I opted for the medium sized, as usual.This is a traditional headphone design through and through. You won't find any in-line volume control or built-in microphone on this unit. Nor are there any fancy technologies like noise isolation or bass boost on SoundPEATS' earbuds. This unit serves its purpose and does what it's intended, which is to play back audio with serviceable quality.

"This review is for a neat set of 9 individual LED candlelights by Koopower. Each unit has its own on and off switch and is powered by its individual battery (the same round ones found in my wireless remote car keys and Bluetooth shutter button, etc). All nine of the candles can be manipulated via the provided remote control, which can be used to turn the LED candles on and off, adjust the brightness levels, set a timer, and more. I can even activate synthetic light flickers (slow or fast) to boost authenticity.

"The Observ backpack is a spacious and functional storage solution for my 13.3 inch laptop when I'm out and about.The unit is made of mostly polyester and mesh materials to ensure comfortability and durability. I still wouldn't treat it roughly when my laptop and electronics are stored in the backpack, as there's not really enough padding to help disperse the shock impacts. All in all, take good care of your own belongings within reason.The light grey on black scheme also gives the design a sharp and attractive look. The backpack's three storage compartments provide a generous amount of space and effectively helps keep my belongings separate, with the main compartment reserved for my laptop specifically. A velcro strap helps hold the laptop in place. Inner pockets are available for me to store my other utensils, such as pens, calculators, notepads, external battery, wireless mouse, AC wall charger, and more.

"My initial impression of Geega's signature compact Bluetooth speaker is very positive so far. The unit itself comes with a stylish brick-like design with matte rubberized finish. The red on black high-contrast color scheme gives the product an aesthetically striking and eye-catching appearance. Every button on the speaker are very accessible in the front, most notably the volume control buttons and Play/Pause button.The versatility of this speaker model is based on its ability to play my music tracks from a variety of sources. The built-in Bluetooth technology lets me connect to virtually all of my Bluetooth-capable electronic devices. There are a slight delay for them to register after each press, however. Manual functions will only respond when the speaker is connected to the media device via Bluetooth, naturally. I was glad to find that theres the alternative auxiliary port hidden under a water resistant cover along with the micro-USB charge port. The aux jack is mainly there for connecting to my smartphone, tablet, and Ultrabook (things that might not have a Bluetooth chip) with the provided 3.5mm audio cable. This is also the more power-efficient way of connecting the two devices together locally.Despite the surprisingly compact design of the portable speaker, the unit outputs very deep and very impressive audio. Bass-heavy tracks were able to maintain most of the lows and high notes and does not suffer from the same noise distortion at high volume levels that are commonly experienced with smaller portable speakers. At higher volume levels, one can even feel the air vibration coming out from the speaker grill and onto the surface area where the speaker stands. Per my testing, the Bluetooth speaker maintained a stable wireless connection to my iPhone 6s from opposite ends of the office (around 20 feet or so). Even after my multi-hour long test sessions with this device, the speaker have yet to need recharging, and should have no problems lasting for around 6 hours before needing a recharge.One thing I would change would be a toggle option for the voice assistant built-into the unit that vocally sounds out when I turn on to connecting to Bluetooth devices. A voice command that's more subtle would have been much appreciated.I understand that the speaker is marketed as waterproof (or water resistant in the description), but I would highly discourage submerging the unit underwater anytime. Usage in the bathroom while showering in steamy mist should be alright. Again, the essential charge and aux ports are covered adequately with a rubber flap, as long as you are using Bluetooth to connect your devices.Packaging Contents Include:- Geega Wireless Bluetooth Speaker- An Auxiliary Audio Cable (3.5mm)- One Standard Micro-USB Charge Cable- An Elastic Handstrap- A User ManualOverall, in terms of the products build and sound quality, functionality, as well as versatility, this product has exceeded my initial expectations and I will give it a 5/5 stars.I was provided a product free of charge in order to provide an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R345IY2VO6W7ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZP4AM9K#wasThisHelpful","R345IY2VO6W7ZH","A193QU46RWDQ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A193QU46RWDQ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Vtin Swan QY8 Pro Wireless Stereo Bluetooth headset came in fancy design packaging that consisted of the stereo headphones, a micro-USB charging cable, as well as several earbuds of varying sizes and soft rubber supports for maximum comfort. A neat had-shelled traveling case also came with the headphones, which is undoubtedly a nice touch.As I was initially skeptical with the new design (with the seemingly bulkier circular surface area, the headphones actually fits decently enough during my workout session. They are relatively feather-light (but not cheap-feeling), and I did not experience much discomfort when wearing these for an extended time. Most importantly, it stayed in place for the duration of the time, regardless of whether I was running on the track mill or doing jumping jacks. This is in most part thanks to the well-designed soft silicone that fits into the groove of your inner ear for further stability. Personally, I prefer the medium sized earbuds, but there are two other sizes to choose from for every individual's different ear size and shape.Playing a variety of different music genre, this is where the Swan truly shines. I've tried playing more J-Rock oriented songs from one of Egoist's albums, then switched to several singles by Supercell. The sound quality from the songs being played were satisfyingly crisp even at 60% volume level.Featuring Bluetooth 4.1, a useful battery indicator icon also pops up on the top part of the smartphone screen for me to keep track of the headphones remaining battery life. Furthermore, I was able to get approximately 6.5 hours of music playback from the fully charged headphones. Impressive considering the battery size. Recharging the headset with the provided micro-USB charge cable took me around 2 hours.Side note: I do prefer the chrome trimmings combined with the flashy neon blue/black color theme of the Swan, as opposed to the generic black/white variations that are so common among similar headphones.Items in the box includes:- QY8 Pro Vtin Pro Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Stereo Headphones- Instruction manual- Standard flat micro-USB charge cable- Variety headbud and earhooks (Small, medium, large)- Carabiner- Hard-shelled travelling caseI was provided a product free of charge in order to provide an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJNYTMAHNNXHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01761XLVK#wasThisHelpful","RJNYTMAHNNXHG","A193QU46RWDQ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A193QU46RWDQ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even with the proper variety of camera apps, the resulting images were unfortunately still limited by the iPhone's own camera hardware. With the add-on fisheye lens by VicTsing, the image viewing angles increased up to 180 degrees with the fish-eye lens. The macro lens (consisting of both 12x and 24x) was ideal for extremely close-ranged shots, which my phone often had difficulties locking onto clearly no matter how many times I tried adjusting the camera focus.The clip itself has a sort of cushion to prevent your screen from getting scratched, which is a really nice touch. An additional micro-fiber cloth was also provided for me to wipe off dust and debris that obstruct my camera lens. The unit also comes in a hard-shelled traveling case, which was a very nice touch.The lenses work for both the front and rear camera. As far as the lens quality, they're pretty well made.

"I saw this speaker on sale from a deal forum and decided to purchase one for a friend who's a Sanrio mascot fanatic.The wireless Bluetooth portable speaker comes in a simple white design contrasted by the pinkness of the Hello Kitty graphics. Despite the obvious marketing cash-grab (ie slapping on a famous brand icon on a cheap and generic speaker model and calling it a day), the speaker does function as intended and outputs admirable sound quality overall.On the unit itself are three manual physical buttons for Play/Pause, Volume Control/Skip and Back. In addition to the Bluetooth wireless connectivity, the Hello Kitty speaker also comes with an auxiliary port for wired playback. The device recharges via a mini-USB charge port. (Most speakers these days utilize micro-USB for recharging).Per my testing, the Bluetooth speaker maintained a stable wireless connection to my iPhone 6 from opposite ends of the office (around 30 feet or so). With the Bluetooth feature, I was able to get about 6 hours of music playback from a single full charge.Overall, this is a solid speaker with good sound quality and port connectivity packed into a very compact and portable size. Ideal for travel or desktop use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDV1PIWU21AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HB77ZS0#wasThisHelpful","RFDV1PIWU21AV","A193QU46RWDQ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A193QU46RWDQ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The enKo Products USB external battery with LED light is a compact light source that runs on rechargeable battery.Per my testing, the lantern has four light modes, consisting of Dim, Medium, Bright, and Flashing Strobe mode. These modes can be toggled via the orange power button located at the bottom of the unit. Around the button is a triangular magnetic clip that makes it more convenient to hook the light source on a heightened location, allowing the LED light source inside to become like a lantern. Alternatively, the unit can also be hooked onto a bag or backpack to act as a night source in the dark.The secondary function of this device is its USB device charging capabilities. Via a covered USB port, I can connect a charge cable to this device to recharge my smartphone one to two times from a full charge. Charging rates were comparable to what I usually get from a standard USB wall charger.Overall, the lantern battery serves as a satisfactory light source.

"I've accumulated quite the collection of speakers over time and all of them have a standardized 3.5mm auxiliary port for wired playback. However, most of them are packaged with extremely cheap and short audio cables that wear over time.With Sabrent's gold plated and durable aux cable, I can once again connect my iPhone to these speakers without having to turn on Bluetooth connectivity. The aux cable arrived in a compact box packaging. The cable itself was a generous 16 feet in length and allowed for quite the extensive connection between my laptop/phone and speaker.

"Cootree's version for the widely popular self-portrait monopod, or selfie stick for short, brings a fresh design to the mix. The main function of this unit is still designed for the selfie enthusiast in mind. However, the new changes with the core design now makes the core unit itself a lot more compact and travel-friendly, which is first made noticeable by the very small package it came in.The clamp at the top that holds the smartphone can now further collapse and fold into an even more compact form for easier storage. When not in use, the unit itself is merely 8 inches in length. However, when extended to its full length the selfie stick can reach up to 31 inches for me to take big group pictures, or take better selfies without having to limit myself to the lengths of my arms.Similar to the older models, the remote paired very quickly with my iPhone via the built-in Bluetooth connection; I simply switched the Bluetooth signal on the stick to on via the switch at the bottom of the handle, and pair it via the Bluetooth menu on my iPhone 6 Plus. It took me approximately 10 seconds total for initial setup. After that, pairing with my iPhone was instant, as the Cootree selfie stick will remember your last paired device. To pair a new device, simply press the pair button again. Note: it will only remember your last paired device. A micro-USB port is once again located at the bottom of the selfie stick, which I have not had to use due to the impressive battery life of the unit.Using it, the devices kept a connection when both were within about 30 feet from one another. The camera also took the picture as soon as I clicked on the shutter button. No lag experienced at all. Again, the texturized grip allowed me to hold the selfie stick securely, and the shutter button was ergonomically and readily accessible.Package Contents:1 x Bluetooth Extendable Self-portrait Monopod1 x Micro-USB Charge Cable1 x User manualOverall, the Cootree remote shutter stick is a solid device that works as advertised and is perfect for taking convenient selfies or large family group pictures. Once I finally shook off my feelings of self-conciousness, I found that the selca monopod was a lot of fun to work with and was definitely instrumental in helping me capture several great selfies and group shots, all without the strange expressions and odd framing due to the limited range between the smartphone and subject(s).I was provided a product free of charge in order to provide an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NKK70M9WZ8NW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5DY758#wasThisHelpful","R2NKK70M9WZ8NW","A193QU46RWDQ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A193QU46RWDQ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometimes, a computer's built-in mic can be limited in terms of sound clarity. It simply doesn't do any communication or voice recording justice.

The metallic mesh material on the mic is durable and the grippy texture helps reduce the chance of me dropping the mic while in use. I did not have to tinker with the microphone settings too much, as it worked fine with the settings it came with.Overall, the Okeyn microphone works as well as expected and was simple to setup.

"I've recently purchased the new Dell XPS 13 (2015) Ultrabook that uses the Mini DisplayPort as its primary output port. This effectively means that none of the HDMI cables I've purchased prior will work with this laptop without some sort of adapter or cable. Thankfully, Sabrent provides me with a simple solution in the form of a Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt) to HDMI converter cable.The 5 inch, white cable itself is made of solid and durable material that should withstand wear even after extended use. Functionality-wise, it works exactly as expected. I have successfully connected my Dell XPS 13 to the HDMI cable via this converter and the 1080P output signal on my HDTV was crisp and clear. I have not experienced any flickering or artifacts as with other third party converters.On the other hand, it should be noted that I did experience wifi signal drops completely while this adapter is plugged into the Mini DisplayPort, which is really weird. I've tried other adapter cables (that are not Thunderbolt) and those seems to work fine.In any case, I'll continue to monitor this occurrence and update it if I find anything new to report in this regard.

"I have been using EasyAcc's basic portable battery charger for the past few days and it has definitely been handle on multiple occasions.Firstly, the EasyAcc 2nd Generation Metal model is an ultra-portable external battery with a whopping 6,400mAh charge capacity. For the most part, the unit has a smooth metal chasis that gives the unit a solid and high quality feel. On one end, you will find a single standard USB output rated at 5V/2Av (max) for charging most smartphones and tablets efficiently. Next to it is a surprisingly big power button, as well as a micro-USB charge port.Using an iPhone 6 for reference, I was able to get about 150% of power from a full charge on average.For reference, here are some common devices and the amount of mAh of capacity they have when they are fully charged:* iPhone 5 battery 1440 mAh battery capacity* iPhone 5S battery 1560 mAh battery capacity* iPad 2 battery 6,944 mAh battery capacity* iPad 3 battery 11,560 mAh battery capacity* iPad 4th (gen.) battery is 11,486 mAh 3.7 VDC at 42.5 Wh* iPad Mini battery is 4490 mAh at 3.72 VDC 16.7 WhThe simplicity and hassle-free nature of the units design and function is this products most underrated selling point. It is almost a daily occurrence where I or a close companion find ourselves out and about and is suddenly in need of a recharge for their smartphone. As most households usually carry at least one electronic device, such as a smartphone or tablet, this makes the device indubitably versatile and accessible in most daily situations.Items in the box includes:1 x EasyAcc Power Bank1 x Micro USB Charging Cable (20 cm)1 x User ManualNo AC wall adapter was provided, but most standard 5V/1A wall charger should work with this product.For the price and, the EasyAcc metal portable external battery is definitely worth it as an entry external battery model that is suitable for a wide variety of events and situations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JH0HGF0JCYGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTU59HM#wasThisHelpful","R2JH0HGF0JCYGD","A193QU46RWDQ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A193QU46RWDQ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using EC Technology's new compact Bluetooth speaker for the past few days and my general impression is very positive overall. The unit itself comes with a stylish brick-like design with rubberized finish. The red on black high-contrast color scheme gives the product an aesthetically striking and eye-catching appearance. Every button on the speaker are very accessible in the front, most notably the volume control buttons and Play/Pause button.The versatility of this speaker model is based on its ability to play my music tracks from a variety of sources. The built-in Bluetooth technology lets me connect to virtually all of my Bluetooth-capable electronic devices. There are a slight delay for them to register after each press, however. Manual functions will only respond when the speaker is connected to the media device via Bluetooth, naturally. I was glad to find that theres the alternative auxiliary port hidden under a water resistant cover along with the micro-USB charge port. The aux jack is mainly there for connecting to my smartphone, tablet, and Ultrabook with the provided 3.5mm audio cable.Despite the surprisingly compact design of the portable speaker, the unit does output very deep and impressive audio. Bass-heavy tracks retained most of the lows and high notes and does not suffer from the same noise distortion at high volume levels that are commonly experienced with smaller portable speakers. At higher volume levels, one can even feel the air vibration coming out from the speaker grill. Per my testing, the Bluetooth speaker maintained a stable wireless connection to my iPhone 6 from opposite ends of the office (around 20 feet or so). Even after my multi-hour long test sessions with this device, the speaker have yet to need recharging, and should have no problems lasting for around 6 hours before needing a recharge.One thing I would change would be a toggle option for the voice assistant built-into the unit that vocally sounds out when I turn on to connecting to Bluetooth devices. A voice command that's more subtle would have been much appreciated.I understand that the speaker is marketed as waterproof (or water resistant in the description), but I would highly discourage submerging the unit underwater anytime. Usage in the bathroom while showering in steamy mist should be alright. Again, the essential charge and aux ports are covered adequately with a rubber flap, as long as you are using Bluetooth to connect your devices.Packaging Contents Include:- EC Technology Wireless Bluetooth Speaker- An Auxiliary Audio Cable (3.5mm)- One Standard Micro-USB Charge Cable- A User ManualOverall, in terms of the products build and sound quality, functionality, as well as versatility, this product has exceeded my initial expectations and I will give it a 5/5 stars.I was provided a product free of charge in order to provide an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14P6ATGQ4BUA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZUC30A#wasThisHelpful","R14P6ATGQ4BUA5","A193QU46RWDQ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A193QU46RWDQ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With a clean, yet vibrant chocolate bar design, EMIE Memo's 8000 mAh external battery charger is solidly built and weighs in at around just shy of 7 oz. I was able to carry the portable battery with me in my hoodie pocket or backpack effortlessly.

Charging my phone from 10% to full took around an hour or so. I was able to get at least two full charges for my phone before the battery pack ran out of power. This is with the phone on, connected, and with apps running in the background.An LED indicator light lets me know how much battery life is left based on its color, with red being 60%-100%, blue 30%-60%, and green 0%-30% remaining. Strangely enough, I feel that the color indicators seem reversed in this case.Again, no Apple charge cable or adapters were provided, but the original Lightning cable that came with my phone was able to charge and recharge the battery just fine. A micro-USB standard cable is provided for me to recharge the battery once it was used up.Features:-8000 mAh battery capacity-Single USB port that detects the connected device and smartly outputs the specific charge rate to ensure there's no overcharging or overheating issues-No AC wall charger or charge cable was provided with this unit, but it is compatible and will recharge with any standard USB wall charger, including my Apple wall chargerFor reference, here are some common devices and the amount of mAh of capacity they have when they are fully charged:* iPhone 5 battery 1440 mAh battery capacity* iPhone 5S battery 1560 mAh battery capacity* iPad 2 battery 6,944 mAh battery capacity* iPad 3 battery 11,560 mAh battery capacity* iPad 4th (gen.) battery is 11,486 mAh 3.7 VDC at 42.5 Wh* iPad Mini battery is 4490 mAh at 3.72 VDC 16.7 WhAs noted, you will not be able to fully charge the latest Apple iPad with the Retina display, as this is only a 800 mAh capacity battery that emphasizes on a slim form factor rather than a charging power house. You must also consider the losses in the charging circuits of both the battery and the device you are charging. When using an external battery, one must take the heat transfer, voltage conversion, and the electronics of your devices charging circuits into consideration. Other contributing factors include running background apps on your smartphone/tablet, as well as its connectivity to Wi-Fi or the LTE networkThis product is solid, functional, and well-designed.

"Aukey's wireless Bluetooth speaker model brings a familiar tried and true compact tin can design to their latest wireless Bluetooth product. Material-wise, the majority of the speaker has a soft, matte finish to it. One pet peeve I have with this unit is that the manual controls such as Play/Pause, Forward, and Rewind are all located at the very bottom of the unit and cannot be accessed unless I physically lift the whole unit up. Not a big deal, however. To turn the unit on, a tiny On/Off button is located on the front of the device.Bass-heavy tracks retains most of the lows and high notes thanks to the enhanced bass boost feature and does not suffer from the same noise distortion at high volume levels that are commonly experienced with smaller portable speakers. I've played most of the jazzy tracks from my Kekkai Sensen official OST collection to great effect.Per my testing, the Bluetooth speaker maintained a stable wireless connection to my iPhone 6 from opposite ends of the office (around 30 feet or so). An auxiliary or headphone input port is also available on the Aukey portable speaker for those who would prefer a wired connection. I should also note that the battery life for this product performed admirably, lasting for hours (5+ so far) of non-stop audio playback from a full charge. Quick, simple, and efficient.I did not do any waterproof testing with this product, nor did I ever attempt to submerge it. At best, I brought this speaker with me to the steamy showers.

"Lavievert's stylish bag is designed specifically for the smallest rendition of Apple's Macbook.The bag itself is made of water-resistant, nylon-like material that resembles the exterior of my down jacket. It is fairly lightweight and does seem like it will protect my laptop from scratches and light drops. Nothing too rugged, but does the job reasonably well.I should not that as I do not have the 11 inch Macbook, I've used this product with my Dell XPS 13 (2015), which has a similar footprint as most standard 11 inch laptops due to the shrunken screen bezel. I had no issue with the fitting at all. Additional pockets on one side of the sleeve also lets me store many kinds of smartphones, accessories, Apple Lightning cable, etc. The opposite side has a zipper pocket that is spacious enough for other small components, like an external battery pack. I am impressed with the overall flawlessness of the bag's stitching and zipper quality. A keychain hand strap can also be optionally attached to the side of the bag to ensure that the precious, expensive laptop doesn't get yanked away by surprise.Again, the sleeve isn't made of leather or some high-end material that you would otherwise pay a pricey sum for. Despite this, the interior material is soft and helps protect my laptop computer from scratches and light shock impact when I'm on the go. It should definitely not be considered as a rugged case. The downsides of having a sleek and compact design is that it will obviously not be as effective as a bulky and tanky full protective case. Regardless, it's just common sense for people to always handle their expensive electronics with care, no matter if they are in a protective sleeve or not. Personally, I'd prefer having a pretty looking case over a bulky monstrosity any day.Although the price is relatively competitive compared to some of the better known brands on the market, this sleeve is a very good value and will handily hold your laptop and then some.I was provided a product free of charge in order to provide an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2841HEL9TD1DH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y82TQ7O#wasThisHelpful","R2841HEL9TD1DH","A193QU46RWDQ3E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A193QU46RWDQ3E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone with terrible sleeping posture, I've always experienced neck cramps once in a while. This U-shaped neck support pillow is ideal for long hours of car or airplane rides.The materials consist of cotton and polyester, with the interior microbeads giving off a feel of a beanie. It is fairly lightweight and I had no problem bringing it with me on vacation.From using this product, the strain and stress I impose on my neck from bad sleeping habits has become nearly non-existent.

"Myoho's version of the Apple accessory comes in the form of a MFi certified Lightning charge cable compatible with all of Apples latest iPhone, iPad, and iPod products using the latest standard charge port. The Lightning cable itself comes in a standard 3.3ft length, making it compatible with the majority of computer USB ports, USB wall chargers, and external batteries. The cables durable material also appears to be sturdy and tangle-free, giving off the feeling that this will last me until my next phone update.More importantly, I have not experienced any ""not supported"" error message when using this cable with my iPhone, so far.Also compatible with most of my iPhone cases, even the durable ones, thanks to its compact connector head.Charging rate is the same as my original Apple Lightning cable.Overall, a very normal and standard charge cable.

Filling these bottles with water... completely full (overflowing), and then measuring the capacity in a graduated cylinder shows these bottles to hold ~113ml if you fill it to the brim.  Filling to the base of the neck (so you can put the cap on) allows you to fill about 111ml (3.75oz), roughly.  So, capacity of these bottles (in ounces) is not 4.0oz!The bottles also arrived very dusty (inside and out), but I always clean and sterilize my glassware before use anyway... just be aware that you will have to clean these!All in all, not a bad purchase, but if you're looking to store measured volumes of liquid in these for retail sale, be aware they will NOT hold 4oz.

"These TM-LTP-BB are great compression leggings, without all the decorative stitching down the legs.  I have several of these Tesla leggings with the added stitching, and they are great, but for when you need something without colored stitching, these do the trick.  Compression is light, not tight, and the material is not see-through, but if you're wearing them ""in public"", you may want to consider shorts over them or compression shorts under them, as they do not contain manhood very well or discreetly.  The waistband is the proper height on these (compared to some going to the belly-button).I wear these as a base-layer under jeans during cooler weather (50's), or for outdoor workouts when I need compression and wicking (even when it's hot out).

"My gal prefers the scent of Silver on me, so I'm so glad I found this identical fragrance as an alternative to the higher-priced, hard-to-find British Sterling Silver!Very few cologne scents smell great on me, or last very long.  So far, only four fit this bill, and two of them smell identical... McGraw Silver and British Sterling Silver (which is discontinued or limited release, but pretty sure they are the same thing, lol).  BTW, the other two favorites are Twilight Woods from Bath & Body Works (which is now discontinued) and British Sterling Reserve H.I.M (black bottle).The scent is fantastic for evenings, but works well for a day-time scent.  It is VERY masculine, without overpowering or smelling like a barn.  It is the perfect blend of wet green leaves, sequoia wood, lavender, orange flower, vetiver, musk, sandalwood and saffron.  The woody undertones and musk are what make this a fantastic evening fragrance, and the lavender, saffron, and orange keep the fragrance light, fresh, and long-lasting.  I can spritz on a little in the morning, and the smell is still there into the evening.  A single spritz is all it takes to ""rebuild"" the aroma for an evening with my gal.Finding this on Amazon was a bonus because Walmart only carries this for the holidays, and the last bottle I bought was $15/oz.  Also, buying the 1oz bottles for $9 is FAR cheaper than buying the 1.7oz bottles for $30!!  A 1oz bottle lasts a LONG time, too, thanks to an efficient atomizer...

"Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!I have arctic compression tops from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!

The first day I used this cover, it rained all day, and the bike stayed DRY.The major complaint is the bottom strap is nothing more than a strip of cloth and the hook was not even tied to it.  There is also nowhere to hook the hook to on the other side :(  I have a couple of bungee cords with spring-clips on the ends (instead of hooks), which will work well to secure the cover in wind/weather, but even for $10, I would expect someone to have sewn a loop onto the opposite side of the cover?  Oh, and there are no grommet holes around the front tire (as the description says)... no biggie for me, as I don't use those to secure the cover to the wheel, but for some, it may be a deal-breaker, even though the price is fantastic for the quality of material.If this were stitched a bit better/straighter, and a better underside-strap, you'd not know the difference between this cover and my more expensive Nelson-Rigg.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ER3QELI4NBAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0132IL7RQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ER3QELI4NBAF","A1PZBHF3YHQXEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PZBHF3YHQXEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son needed a new welding jacket to replace the heavy cotton welding ""shirt"" he had been using (which held out for 2-3 months).  This leather jacket is very heavy and thick, and serves to protect the upper body from sparks and slag.  Arms are plenty long enough for overhead welding, and Velcro cuffs make the sleeves tight and make it easy to tuck into leather gauntlets.  There is minor adjustment at the waist, and he wishes another set of snaps were on the back (to make it a little tighter), but they can be added easily since the jacket is leather!My son normally wears Large jackets (off the rack), and this jacket fits like an XL, with plenty of room for a sweatshirt underneath.  Arms are plenty long enough for his 34"" arms.  Neck fits his 16"" neck, and is comfortable and prevents sparks from entering the jacket.  Pencil/tool pockets are on each sleeve, and the interior pocket is huge, yet easy to access.  He likes this jacket far better than the all-cotton jacket he was using, and this heavy-leather jacket only costs $20 more?His only complaint on the jacket is the white powder that took several days to remove, and the light grey color does show where slag has made contact... but a stiff brush cleans the jacket up nicely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KNZC2EJ7VLZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009A4NLT4#wasThisHelpful","R1KNZC2EJ7VLZ3","A1PZBHF3YHQXEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PZBHF3YHQXEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This red one is my second purchase of a Syma S107/S107G!  I purchased a yellow one for my son last Christmas, and he still has fun playing with it indoors on a rainy day...  He has upgraded his with a larger battery, so it will fly closer to 10-14 minutes between charges, instead of 6-8 minutes, and the larger battery (only a few grams heavier) seems to give the toy more stability and control.  I will likely upgrade this one as well.I purchased this one for myself  :)These are very easy to fly, and virtually everyone who has tried to fly it has somewhat mastered the controls by the second battery charging.  They are very durable as well... even crashing into furniture, walls, doors, (or the dog) has yet to damage them, but even if you do damage them, replacement parts and replacement batteries are readily available here on Amazon... for cheap!  Be aware these are for INDOOR USE, and even slight currents from heating registers, A/C units, or fans can make controlling them difficult.

"I didn't think I'd like a ball forcing the head side-to-side, but I'm amazed at the control you have with this razor, even over tough spots (like ankles and knees), as well as more ""delicate"" areas.  This is my 3rd handle/bundle purchase (this one for travel), and I've been through probably a dozen of the heads... not one nick (yet), but I also use a good shaving cream, NOT soap, and don't rush the job!The handle allows movement ""just enough"" to the side to avoid nicks and cuts, and because it only moves side-to-side, it allows you to apply the right amount of pressure to ensure a smooth shave.  The 5-blade heads really make quick work of stubble in a single pass, and you can usually go an extra day between shaves (as compared to twin or triple-head razors (even the original Venus).  The handle is also less slippery than the Body handle or Original Venus handle.  These 5-blad heads also fit other Gillette handles, and the 3 and 4-blade heads fit this ball handle too.Some comments have been harsh about the lube-strips ""melting"" on the heads, but honestly, I've not seen this issue, but I also don't leave the razor face-down in a puddle after use... it hangs upright to dry (or lays blade-up on the shelf) after use.The heads cost a bit more, but I look for coupons and sales, and the heads do last considerably longer than the triple-blade versions, so cost per head sort of works out in the wash...

These were an excellent price (1/3 the local sporting-goods store cost).For a Jr player, just starting out, these have additional cleats for support and balance, and they work well on hard, natural-surfaces or turf, and allow for reasonable balance on concrete (walking to the field).As with all Puma and Adidas soccer boots, ankle cut-outs are low, which allow for greater range of motion, and  allow for wearing ankle-guards, without causing pressure-points or pain while running.

"I recently purchased a single SK98 to test, and was so impressed with it, I had to purchase this twin-pack so I would have more of them on-hand.  Don't expect them to be StreamLights, but for ~ $8 each, you can't go wrong with them for a decent, reliable tactical-style flashlight.  These are perfect for the outdoorsman of the family, technicians, inspectors, or anyone needing a bright, inexpensive flashlight.This SK98 uses 18650 batteries (flat-top or button-top), and they recommend using protected cells, although as long as you are using a good name-brand cell from Sony, Samsung, LG, Panasonic, etc., and an Amp-rating of 10A or higher (discharge-rate), then you should have zero issues. I personally use Panasonic 3400mAh 10A and Sony VTC4 20A batteries in my tactical lights and have for years without issue. One thing to be careful of is to NOT leave rechargeable batteries in the flashlight, after more than 30-min of use, as this will damage the battery.  I rotate my batteries, and do not store a battery in every light, but do keep one in the light I use the most (swapping for a fresh battery at least once a week, even if unused). Also, do not drain a battery to the point it will not fire the LED, as this will damage the battery too. Once the beam is visibly weak, it is time to change the battery!If you don't use your flashlight frequently, it is best to store it without a battery installed.  Purchase at least two 18650 batteries for each light, and store each light with a pair of batteries (in a plastic battery case, for safety).  Then when you need the light, batteries are close-by.  If you store the batteries consistently with the (+) side to the left in a flip-top-box, it will make it EASY to install the batteries into the flashlight, even in pitch-black-dark.  Storing them outside the flashlight also makes it convenient to top-off the charge of the battery pair every couple of months, so the batteries are never dead or below full-charge, ready for action!Comparing the light against a higher-end light of known lumens, this light does not reach 1200lm, but is probably in the 900-1000lm range. It is definitely brighter than my 800lm light, but not nearly as bright as my 1200lm light.I do like that the flood setting is smooth and even in light and color (cool-white), but in spot-mode, the beam is square... at about 4-6', you can easily make out the entire shape and texture of the CREE LED.The body of the flashlight has a nice texture and grip, and the button push is solid on each click. The half-press of the button smoothly transitions from high-beam, low-beam and strobe.  Focusing the light is easy and not stiff, but still tight enough to hold the position you leave it in.  I find the light is actually brighter in full flood position.The belt clip is a bit cumbersome, but you get use to it in your hand. It does seem to be solid. I've only had one belt clip break on my previous versions of UltraFire flashlights, so I'm sure this one will hold up as well?I only recommend a bit of silicone lube (or Vaseline) on the threading of the tail-cap, because if yours is like mine, they will be shipped quite dry, and the lubrication adds to the waterproofing, as well as easy removal of the cap.This light appears to be better than my much older versions of UltraFires, so I like I said, I bought a couple more so I would have these better, upgraded UltraFire flashlights to replace my aging, underpowered lights...","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6A5C2XU4DBUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0QFZ06#wasThisHelpful","R6A5C2XU4DBUF","A1PZBHF3YHQXEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PZBHF3YHQXEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scale arrived quickly, and is a nice ""clean"" addition to my bathroom.  The scale appears to be ""precise"", which is what you want for daily weight monitoring.  The glass top is heavy, but not quite as thick as some of the premium scales I've seen/used, and I do wish the white around the view-module were black, like the pads, but white is not bad.As for accuracy, it is actually quite accurate.  I had just came home from a doctor visit when this scale arrived, so I immediately checked my weight against the Doctor's balance-scales.  This digital scale was accurate to less than 1/2-lb (reads 0.4-lb higher).  Precision was determined by checking the scale several times over the next hour, and each time, the scale showed the exact same weight.  I stepped on it once, while holding two 10-lb dumbbells, and the weight was 20.2-lb higher.  Stepping back on it again without the weights, and the reading was exactly the same as it had been 20-min earlier.For a ""cheap"" scale, I am quite impressed with the quality and precision.

"I've owned one of these since the 1980's, and still use it today!Not much has changed in the design, other than lighter materials in the tent body and floor, but the one I have looks basically the same (tan color, not green).  I've logged hundreds of nights camping, in everything from hammocks, and curled next to the fire, to 9-man cabin tents for a week+, yet I still go back to this ""Scout"" tent when backpacking and weekend motorcycle camping, and it sees at least two night's use per year, usually lots more.  I've always kept the tent clean, water-proof it with Camp-Dri every couple of years, and re-seal the seams at the same time.  I still have the original poles and stakes too, but I'm sure the ones made back then are much higher quality ;)The size is perfect for one-person and their gear, and two people can sleep comfortably in it (as long as one of you doesn't toss/turn/kick all night).  It is quite cozy for you and your spouse or BF/GF, and no-where near the sardine-can-feeling you get from other 2-person bivy or A-frame-styles.Condensation is a bigger issue in this tent than one with top-mesh and rain-fly.  One late-October trip a couple years ago, the weather went below zero, and the condensation froze the walls of the tent (solid) - removed the poles and it still stood-up, lol.  Another Early December snow-storm dropped several inches on us overnight, and we woke up sweating to death because the snow had insulated the tent (and with the mesh vents/doors closed, there was no air-flow to vent body-heat)!  I've never had an issue with leakage during rain or thunderstorms, although if I can, I try to put up a half-shelter tarp or other method of deflecting rain from direct-contact with the tent.As one reviewer stated, taking care of your equipment, and knowing how to properly use it make all the difference in how well they work and how long they last.  I've owned tents from Coleman, Eureka, Kelty, North-Face, Alps, Wentzel, Tex-sport, and others... and this tent, one Eureka, and a couple of Coleman tents are the only ones that have stood up to years and years of REAL use!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPNZ413C6TOR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006V2B2I#wasThisHelpful","RPNZ413C6TOR0","A1PZBHF3YHQXEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PZBHF3YHQXEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No, this watch doesn't make smoking-hot women want to be your clingy-girlfriend... it IS the clingy girlfriend :)  Explanation below:First of all, this is not my first Seiko 5 Automatic, so I'm basing this review against my older model's function.Pros:+ Excellent size / weight / thickness+ Smooth finish and flush-mounting crown (recesses into the case)+ Keeps excellent time (so far, as long as you keep it running, see Cons)+ Expect lots of compliments, as this is a very sharp-looking watch!+ Perfect watch for every-day, casual, or office-wear+ Slim fit and good weight (not too heavy) lets you know it is on your arm, but doesn't get in the way or feel like a brick+ Diameter is perfect for a smaller or mid-size wrist - might look small if you have 9"" wrists+ Exhibition back is smooth, clear, and a nice addition to this watch, plus you can see main function of the watch and winder+ Dual language day-display is handy and functional, but not the most important feature.+ Day-of-the-week display is standard, weekdays are in black, Saturday in blue, and Sunday in red.Cons:- Band uses tuning-fork lock-pins which are a beast to remove for band-sizing - fortunately you normally size a band once...- Crown sits recessed into the case, and is difficult to catch it to extend the crown- Crown rotation is stiff, even when setting day/date or time (when crown is extended) - have to use my fingernail to catch the knurling.- Adjustment of the catch is 1/4 and 1/2 of a link, so if you need 3/4 of a link, it will be too tight or slightly loose based on the # of links removed.The biggest con of them all (and the reason I call this watch a clingy-girlfriend) is the watch MUST be worn daily, for at least 14 hours or it will not keep accurate time.  My older Seiko 5 can be worn as little as 8-10 hours per day, and it will continue to keep time (run) for the next 24-30 hours.  The older Seiko 5 is also MUCH easier to manually wind, and all it takes is a moment or two winding it daily to keep it running.  This watch (after wearing for 16 hours) ran dead in 6 hours the first day, and after wearing 14 hours the second day, it stopped running after 6 hours again!I will continue to work with it, and hopefully it will get it to the level of my other Seiko 5, or I will have to invest in an auto-winder... because I don't like wearing the same watch day after day.Update:After wearing the watch daily for two weeks, I took it off on a Friday night, and picked it back up on Sunday morning, and it was still running, and the time was still reasonably accurate.As with all automatic watches, some degree of inaccuracy is expected, but this watch is gaining roughly 70-seconds over the past week, or +10 seconds per day.  Also note, during that week, I only removed my watch to shower, so it was at never ""at rest"".  I will test again for a week by removing it for sleep, and see if the accuracy improves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J778O2KVMLV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051VUDB4#wasThisHelpful","R1J778O2KVMLV8","A1PZBHF3YHQXEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PZBHF3YHQXEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A watch box is an excellent way to keep your watches dust-free, scratch-free, and makes a handsome display.  Whether you have $10 watches or $10,000 watches, they should be stored separately and securely to keep them looking nice.The ""glass"" top is a high-quality plexi-glass or Lexan... very clear and smooth.The ""leather"" is actually a heavy vinyl with decent looking stitching... it looks very classy.The latch is so-so, almost cheap looking, but it is functional, and even has a lock with two-post key supplied.The ""pillows"" are not pillows... they are foam-filled ribbed velvet-ish material with rigid sides.  They are a bit small for the slots, but big for the average-size band (if you attempt to close the band around the pillow)... you have to leave the band loose around the pillow.  For this reason, I wish the pillows were larger, and filled the slots fully, as this would make the bands more visible, and would eliminate gaps at top/bottom of each slot.Overall, I'm pleased with the box, as it allows me to safely store six watches when they are not in use... and eliminates the danger of my quality watches from being damaged by laying loose in a drawer.  It also eliminates the clutter of having watches lying around, loose, on the top of a dresser!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSY6P99IJJYQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BI7AZG#wasThisHelpful","RSY6P99IJJYQ5","A1PZBHF3YHQXEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PZBHF3YHQXEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price, I can't complain too much, but the MFG padded the package with ""extras"" to make you think you're getting a bargain.The pin removal tool works decently enough, but the one I received is bent out of the box (the tip of the pin is bent) - I straightened it with the supplied pliers :)Zero replacement pins for the removal tool are suppliedThe pin-set-block is okay, but should also have shallower sides for thinner or ladies bracelets.  It is unusable for smaller bands.The pliers are dollar-store equivalentThe hammer... is handy, actually, and decent weight and the nylon end is just hard enough to be usable without causing damage.The case-back knife seems okay, but appears to be cheap metal, not a good, tempered stainless steel... my pocket knife works better!I've not used the crab-wrench, but am leery of a two-prong wrench... prefer 3-prongs for stability and torque.The 5 screwdrivers supplied are useless... the 3 flat-head are all the exact same size, same for the 2 Philips-head... only difference is length.The three punches... all the same size diameter, and all too big for most of my bands.The spring-bar tool is highly useful... if it were sharper, and the pin-push were tapered like it should be....Tweezers... they could be made of Aluminum-foil (they're useless)Do yourself a favor... spend your $7 on a decent pin removal tool (with extra pins of different sizes).  If you need a good crab-wrench for screw-on case-backs, buy a 3-prong version (it will prevent slipping and give better torque).

"I purchased this watch as a gift (not from Amazon) on sale, and it was far more beautiful than the images show.  The contrast of Stainless and Gold-tone, along with the champagne/beige dial makes it very classy looking.  If you are worried about fade of the gold-tone, don't be... I have a Bulova that is probably 30-yrs old, and the gold-tone stainless may be scratched, but it is still bright.The band is easily adjustable, and can be replaced with a nice leather band if you don't care for the Stainless bracelet.The ONLY thing I wish this watch had is the day/date function.  She has much cheaper (big-name-brand) watches with date function.  Like I said, ""I"" wish it had day/date function, but she pointed out that it's just one more thing to have to re-set every month with less than 31 days!  So, point taken :)Also, to me, the large numerals detract from the class of the watch (I feel it should have hashes and perhaps just a 12 or ""Tuning-fork logo"" at top), but as she put it, ""it makes it easier to read at a glance""... so if she's happy, I'm happy!I cannot comment on how it keeps time (as I'm not the one wearing it), but she's not complained about it losing or gaining time, but she's only had it for a few days, too.Oh, Bulova watches being made today no longer have the ""tuning-fork"" logo on the face.  So, if you like the logo, now is the time to snag new-old-stock from the suppliers, before they are no longer available or the prices sky-rocket!UPDATE:  She's had this watch for nearly two weeks (I set the watch against my atomic clock when I bought it), and we just compared the time to the atomic-clock...

It is not even a full second off from setting it nearly a month ago.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8IZ7TROYWVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOTGE6O#wasThisHelpful","R2S8IZ7TROYWVY","A1PZBHF3YHQXEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PZBHF3YHQXEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this as a gift, and it is probably the second nicest Seiko watch I own.  The nicest is only due to sentimental value (belonged to my grandfather).  The only difference between mine and the one pictured is that mine has a satin-white dial, not black.The watch is flawless in fit and function.  The controls are intuitive, and the alarm is accurate (although not very loud).  I rarely use the chronograph function, but it is nice to have.  The watch keeps phenomenal time, on par with finer Swiss watches, and the solar function means a few minutes a day in direct sunlight (or a few hours a week under incandescent lamps) and you'll never have to worry about keeping it running.  10 ATM waterproof, so it's not suitable for diving, but certainly will be safe to get wet.  I have no hesitation if I forget to take it off before jumping into the pool or to wear when canoeing or on/near water.I've had this one for roughly 4-months, and so far it has kept perfect time... maybe gaining 1-1.5 seconds per month?  Which is far more accurate than my Seiko 5 Automatic, which tends to gain about 5-seconds per month.... Even a good Swiss watch will be +/- 15-60 seconds annually.This is simply an elegant, daily-wear time-piece, which looks far more expensive than it is!The only issue with the watch was sizing the band... the link pins are VERY snug, and it required using a jeweler's pin removal tool to prevent damage to the band.  Time will tell if the gold-tone on the case and band fade, although the gold-tone on my other Seiko has held up well over the past few years.... Hopefully this watch has the same quality!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMSJ7EEWZMVZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7MY5BU#wasThisHelpful","RMSJ7EEWZMVZ3","A1PZBHF3YHQXEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PZBHF3YHQXEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, this is nothing more than a green Venus (Mach3 blade-set with a wider head), marketed for men.  Gillette is taking advantage of the ""manscaping"" fad, and charging more for a Green Venus, over the Blue ones marketed for women.  Sadly, the Venus blades last much longer, probably because of the difference in the lubricating strips?Pros:It works (a few times)The wide-flat head works smoothly over body curves (preventing digging)No wire-strips covering the bladesCons:It works for about 3 shaves per headThe lubricating strips dry out after the first use and flake awayThe lubricating strips work to dull the blades faster by ""coating them"" with a soapy gunkBlades clog very fast, even if only shaving light stubbleCost per blade/shave compared to Venus or men's Mach-3 blades - Venus is twice as many blades for $4 moreI've thought this would work better than a ""woman's razor"", but this is nothing more than a green Venus (which are cheaper, as I pointed out).

"Well designed ""suit of armor"" for your Moto-X2I've had a similar case on my Nexus for more than 2-years, and it provided extremely good protection for drops, bumps, and bangs.This one is slightly different, slightly less armor on the sides (where it wasn't needed), and a bit thinner, which makes it far easier to hold the larger Moto-X2.The case is easy to slide on, and easy to work with.  The belt case is very tight and stiff, but if it is like the one I had with my Nexus, it will loosen up and be easier to holster and remove the phone in a few weeks/months.UPDATE:I've been using this case for nearly 10 months, and it has protected my phone well from several drops onto concrete!  The holster has loosed-up a bit, and is not nearly as snug as the first week or two of use.The only complaint I have about the holster is that the middle tabs which hold the phone in place also press the volume-down button as you holster it, causing the phone to move to vibrate-mode 3 out of 5 times :(  It does not matter if you holster the phone upside-down or right-side-up...  I do wish one of the tabs were slightly lower, so it would not press my volume button... but this is not a deal-breaker because the case itself is better than Otterbox!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R350Y4KTUE21GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQZWU84#wasThisHelpful","R350Y4KTUE21GW","A1PZBHF3YHQXEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PZBHF3YHQXEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This particular book although rather slow in movement or plot at times,  has it share of action and good dialogue as do most westerns.

Sending the DAK (Deutsches Afrika Korps) led by Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel to North Africa, Hitler hoped to turn the fighting in the Axis favor.  Over the next two years Hitler both won, and lost, so that by October of 1942 Rommel saw the turning point at El Alamein and was forced into a withdrawal toward Tunisia.  One of the bitter pills for Rommel was that he could not receive adequate supplies, and as much as anything else, the fighting could not be supported as need be. Thankfully, we could and did intercept the German radio transmissions.  With good result that we sunk much of what was shipped to Rommel.George Forty (retired Lt. Colonel, past Royal Tank Regiment) has been writing on the desert war since the 1980s in past books such as The Desert Rats, but this newest book from 2002 sums up the latest of his 20 some years of research and study.

"The Ardennes offensive, also known to WWII history as ""the battle of the bulge"", has been the subject of innumerable books down through the years. The focus is of course the German attempt to break through the American lines to Antwerp hoping to not only defeat the British and Americans but also to throw them backwards away from Germany.  Hitler aimed to do that and by doing so gain time to come back with his 'wonder' weapons to win the war.  He ultimately did not get close to Antwerp, ran out of fuel for his beloved panzer units, and prolonged the war for at least another 6 months.The well known military historian, George Forty, here not only 'traces the whole story' but used U.S. documents to show how the American troops stood up to all of this.  He further provides not only adequate background information but data on ""organization, equipment, and conduct of"" all forces involved.This book will join the many others already on library shelves which detail and describe one of the last important battles fought by the ETO army in the second world war.Lt. Colonel (rtd) George Forty served 30 years in the Royal Tank Regiment, not only in Korea, were he was wounded, but other theatres before retiring in 1977 to put down the sword, and pick up the pen.  According to the dust jacket he has also written more that 50 books ""specialising in armoured warfare"".I have a few of his books, anyone reading his books will be rewarded with good, solid history from a man well versed in the subjects of which he writes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AOJJPP4XV2L1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0304358029#wasThisHelpful","R2AOJJPP4XV2L1","A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A selection of The Military Book Club back in 1980s and  still a very good book I feel to have on your personal library shelves, I am glad to have acquired it back then.Perrett gives a good lesson in Hitler's Panzerwaffe and its leaders,  while offering a good, basic history and training of the armor arm that gave a fairly good account of itself in the war, and also gave us probably one of the better tanks of all time: the King Tiger.The Panzerwaffe, strength never exceeding one fifth of the German army, made an enormous impact in the second world war,  especially on the Eastern Front.Somewhat of a ""basic"" book for my library, even at this late date.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34LBMZMUIEE4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312911300#wasThisHelpful","R34LBMZMUIEE4O","A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not sure why in some other reviews people want to say this is ""the first November man novel"".  I understand after following this series from the 1980s that this book is #7 in the series.  No matter really, but newer readers should understand that.This book is as good as it gets with Bill Granger's series of November Man novels, and that is for me very good indeed.  For someone who grew up during the James Bond craze and later worked during my military years indirectly for NSA as a spy of sorts, though now much outdated, this series is like a breath of clear air.

"TOMBSTONE STAGE--WILLIAM HOPSONFor a 1948 western, this novel still reads very well. Not quite what I had expected but very good never-the-less. Plot has to do with smuggling of goods and people (Chinese) into Arizona from Mexico, and numerous attacks by Apache Indians.  It is the era of Geronimo and other raiding Apaches with the cavalry undermanned at Fort Huachuca.  Plot also concerns itself with the love triangle between and Army officer and a smuggler in love with the same eastern gal.

"Stony Man is a series that combines the old Able Team and Phoenix Force with Mack Bolan, at times. Working out of Virginia's Stony Man Blue Ridge area they are a super professional group carrying out missions for the justice department that are so important/sensitive to national security that they can be entrusted to no one else. Sometimes to be successful they need to operate very close to the law or at certain time, outside the law.They take on jobs such as this one where ""ecoterrorism becomes the perfect cover for a renegade Chinese and North Korean military group."". If you know what ""ecoterrorism"" is and you are interested, then this plot will possibly be plausible to you. Discrediting the Japanese whaling enterprise is of only passing interest to me.  I have been reading these Gold Eagle books since the early 1980s having quite a collection of them running into the hundreds while at times find them hard to follow as in ""what's the point"" of little interest to me.This one was written by Douglas P. Wojtowicz, an author who has written at least 12 other Stony Man novels and numerous others in the Gold Eagle series of books, an author I both respect, trust and normally like.  This book, however, doesn't get me involved in the plot as some others do.  I'm sure it's not his writing, just me.  I'm old and some of this higher today tech loses me. (I'm hardly able to do this review on a PC)  You may be quite different and find them enjoyable.I really find this stuff fairly enjoyable (I was during my military service a spy of sorts indirectly working for NSA, my role now much outdated) and generally like to keep up on this world and how it has grown and evolved.  But somehow, for me, I just couldn't really get interested in this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1486Z2UG4OANE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373804466#wasThisHelpful","R1486Z2UG4OANE","A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rifle, ColoradoFort CrawfordFort GarlandColorado Territory was admitted to the Union in 1876, so this helps to date this story from a truly masterful writer of western fiction. Luke Short (Frederick Glidden brother of western writer Peter Dawson) also mentions Fort Crawford as being a ""new post"" raised to help ""as a counter threat to (Chief) Ouray and his restive Utes who had declined to submit to reservation authority"".  So this area is located within Ute country with the western Rockies mentioned at least once. The location and the approximate date of this story is given us by things the author knew and mentioned.This story does not, however, revolve around the Utes only the country, and centers on the horse trade or selling going on at that time. It is the story of a drifter, Frank Chess, who can not seem to settle down and grow roots, but has to see what is over the next hill.  This earns him the disdain of local people and he is seen as of no account.  He would possibly be seen as something worse if people knew of ""his crooked errands"" he is doing for his boss Rhino Hulst (J.J. Hulst, Horses bought and sold) .  Also Chess then proceeds to lose ""his crooked money in the nearest saloon, the nearest poker game, and to the nearest girl in a spangled dress"".But murder quickly brings him down to reality--he isn't the killer but all elements point directly to him as the killer of Rob Custus, with the local sheriff Buck Hannan very close to putting Frank Chess under arrest.A western novel that centers on ranching and horse selling and the greed, dishonesty and meaness of some persons  involved. It also has much concerning the lives of average people in a small western town going about their daily affairs. Be they doctor, lawyer, cowboy, or the couple of women in love with the same man.  This man or ""easygoing saddle tramp"" finds ""he had something to kill for, die for--and live for!'.Not the ""best"" Luke Short novel I've encountered (like AMBUSH or SUMMER OF THE SMOKE) but one that holds your interest to the point of wondering just how Frank Chess will work out of the things that scare him and endanger him.  Also which one of these women will he come to see as really loving him.  More than a western novel and more a novel of some literature on the west.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TZ08KHAGELO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LL7AKQ#wasThisHelpful","R2TZ08KHAGELO3","A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Before that can happen, he taken hostage by a woman named Greta. ""She had shot Slocum, stabbed him, nearly hanged him and clubbed him half to death..."" all for the $5000.00 he has on him.After awhile of this sillyness, one just gets tired of the inane plot and gives up to go to another Jake Logan, hopefully a better one.

He has been forced by a sheriff into being part of jury, whether he wants to be or not.  Slocum is locked up in a saloon, given all the booze, all the food, and all the women he wants and is to be paid $1.00 a day.

"1861Pointed RockFree territory of Wyomingbelow the Oregon TrailA very weak storyline here having Skye in pursuit of wife who is lying accusing Fargo of killing her husband.  Fargo spends most of the novel in a chase to catch or re-catch her to get to the bottom of her lies.  Chase takes up most of the novel and becomes involved with attacks of the Arapaho Indians.  Usual run in with crooks too also chasing the wife before we get to the reasons why she has been doing what she is doing.For a #2 of a beginning series this book is somewhat of a let down.  I have followed this series since its inception, having a few hundred books on the shelf, and this is one of less interesting books.  This series of books now stands at #393 and most of the books have improved to the point of offering a better plot line. The books now are also written by several western writers, not just by one man, such as Jon Sharpe back in the 1980s.  Sharpe probably went on write a lot of the first 100 books or so.It may seem I don't like this series of books, however, this has become my most favorite series over the years.  I have a majority of the books published since 1980 and while this is not literature in the classic sense of the word, some of the books are really outstanding.

One person comes to his aid, someone named Pat Garrett.  Pat is just a younger man starting out, and he very much wants to become a lawman-in this he thinks that Clint Adams can guide him.

"This is it.This is the very first one of a series that now stands at 388 books and growing. This very first in the series was published way back in January, 1982. The book has gone through at least 6 printings.  Also, the book is fairly difficult to find in 2nd hand book shops.This book is about average for the start of a new series, as it has nothing to draw from or build upon.  The Clint Adams of this book is not yet the one we have become more familiar with. The Clint Adams of this book is therefore more ""cardboard"" cut out or one-dimentional man than he has now become. For me the book suffers from that aspect.Clint Adams has recently given up his badge as a lawman roughly 6 months ago, bought a wagon, tools, and supplies to travel and work as a gunsmith.  In the town of Baxterville, Missouri, (until recently named Macklinville) Clint meets up with 3 women who are being invited, that is run out, of town.  They want to go to Mexico and need a trail guide.  Well, since Clint is pretty nigh broke, the $200.00 they offer sounds good.He leaves Baxterville next morning with the 3 women heading ""on  the dirty and dangerous trail""  for Oklahoma, where he will break off the Shawnee Trail to the Chisholm Train. Thence he will stop for supplies at Anadarko, and then continue into Texas and down into old Mexico.  Along the way, Clint expects trouble with the Kiowa,  & Comanche tribes once in Texas, and later when in Mexico with the Apaches. He expects the trip to take 2 to 3 weeks.But a couple of things trouble him.  Macklinville was named for ""Con Macklin"" who they said was killed due to his tyrannical hold on the town. This is the same town Clint has just left, and he has heard enough to wonder if Macklin is really dead or this is just a scam.  Also, he keeps hearing about Macklin's Treasure and the women aren't saying as word, in fact they aren't really all that talkative and friendly now that they are on the trail.  Also, Clint believes someone is riding on their back trail, he can feel it with the hairs on his neck.  The are in for trouble for sure, make no mistake.In Anadarko, Clint sees Wild Bill Hickok and Wyatt Earp, one the more better parts of the book.  But once Clint and his party reaches Mexico, he finds that there is a lot the women have kept from him and it looks as if Clint may not get any money whatever, but may  instead lose his life.  Saying any more would ruin the plot for a interested reader.  I will only say it was good that Clint had some worries about all this along the trail, and some things he had already worked out by the time they reached Mexico.

"Clint Adams has escaped 3 men trying to bushwack him, though he has been only able to kill one of them.  Also his Darley Arabian horse whom Clint dearly loves has been wounded, actually the bushwackers tried to kill the horse but missed both shots.  With one bullet wounding the horse.  Clint can forgive the men trying to kill the him, but not his horse, Eclipse.  For that he wants to see them dead.As the book unfolds, the information gained through this dead man and additional information Clint is able to find concerning the dead man's friends, Clint is able to get a fairly good understanding of the situation.  He begins to see and understand that Derrick Sands and Adam Dunn have recruited additional men and will not stop with this single bushwack. Some unknown person of money is after Clint's life.  Also the bushwackers now plan to distract Clint in a later attempt to steal Eclipse from the vet who is working on the horse.Through the aid of an able tracker, Clint is now able to move against these men.  Eight to two odds is not very good, so Clint and the tracker know they must somehow even the odds if they are to survive.Another great read in the Gunsmith series; ""over fifteen million Gunsmith books in print!"".Next one up: Mexico Mayhem, #387.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24TSV3ZF0TAZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0515154431#wasThisHelpful","R24TSV3ZF0TAZF","A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having hundreds of Gunsmith paperbacks on the shelf, having read quite a few of them, I have to state with certainty that this one, #388, may be the strangest one of all, also maybe the best one of all.The ""Magic Man"" is one that we never figure out, one that Clint Adams never gets a good reading on either.  And at this book's ending it seems we may come across the ""Magic Man"" again, and for that I am truly hopeful.Clint originally comes on the Magic Man by accident, or was it.  Well, anyway, Clint begins to travel with this showman for a few cities and shows before they eventually part.  Clint heads on to Texas and the Magic Man continues onward west.  In between their meeting and parting, much happens.  It would be impossible and unfair for me to try to describe any of that.  All I will say is that to read this book is one of the most enjoyable things I've ever done.  I think J. R. Roberts (R. J. Randisi) has written one of the best novels I've ever read.  That is no exaggeration.It is one reason this series now stands at 388 books and his fans seemingly cannot get enough.  As I've said, I myself have hundreds on the shelves and I'm sure that number will continue to grow.#389, The Salt City Scrape is next, in May.

"Clint Adams, ""after a few attempts  are made on his life"", has decided to go to Mexico for awhile.  He is staying at Laguna Niguel, a sleepy, little town by the ocean.  While Clint finds an old friend, Avery Castle, and a Father Flynn living there, people he has known from previous times under different names, so can trouble possibly be far behind? Gun trouble that is. But the book is well written in a suspenseful manner that you never know which of these people, if any, or others,  will be sucked into the trouble. Again the cast of supporting characters is all that one can wish.This is another in the Gunsmith series, and as such helps move the entire series along.  The book ambles along pleasantly and J. R. Roberts (R. J. Randisi) is up to his normal inventiveness with good fiction.  Another book that a fan or occasional reader can enjoy.

"This movie is included in the 100 movie pak, disc 13, from Guns of the West by Mill Creek Entertainment.  Fairly good transfer, too.  At least 3 other Ritter films are included in this batch-and I am a fan of ole Tex.  On other groups from Mill Creek I have other films by Tex Ritter as many others as well.  If you enjoy these old ""B"" movies, don't be shy about getting them.This movie is a different kind of western, dating from 1937, in living black and white.  The plot of this one was reused several times in other movies as well: when you have a good thing, keep using it.  I do enjoy the older westerns such as this with say the ones with, Hoppy, or John Wayne. Here you have a crooked businessman who is stealing other people's horses, and if he signs a bill of sale, he eventually steals that back too. Leaving the buyer to be branded a horse thief.  Only he pulls it one to many times.Good ole fun in this western with Tex Ritter and Jerry Bergh, with many others.

"My wife has particularly sensitive skin, and has difficulty finding cosmetics and skin care products that don't cause irritation or even rashes.  She was very pleased to find that this Eye Serum caused her no trouble, but was disappointed to find little in the way of noticeable results.  The scent was mild and not unpleasant, and the product absorbed quickly, but there was no apparent tightening (although in fairness, there is not much need for any).  So, while the formulation is good for sensitive skin, and the sensations are pleasant, the effects are minimal, at least for her very fair skin.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSYXX5PKOT9ZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB865F8#wasThisHelpful","RSYXX5PKOT9ZC","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It would be helpful to have some instructions for this kit, but it is doable.With the two black pieces, it's fairly straightforward to determine which end the wires come out of -- the opposite end from the sides that mate together.  The trick to figuring out how to assemble these is to pay attention to the yellow pieces -- they each fit in only one of the two black pieces, and each in only one orientation.Once you see which yellow piece goes in which black piece, it starts to fall into place.  The male pins are not round, but rather have a flat profile, and will only fit through one of the two yellow pieces properly in one particular orientation.  You cant test fit a non-crimped pin, because the crimping is necessary to fold the wings on the pin far enough that they fit in to the housing, but you can release a fully-inserted pin with a small flat-head screwdriver if you are careful -- it's like releasing a heavy-duty zip tie by pulling back on a plastic tab.The 20 blue gaskets are identical, and this is where I'm just guessing, but I thing are put on the wire before crimping the insulation crimp of the pins.  I was able to align the narrower portion of the blue gasket with the end of the insulation of the stripped wire, so that the outer crimp of the pin captures the gasket while grasping the wire insulation.In the process of learning how to do this all, I had some unsuccessful crimps.  There are exactly the correct number of male and female pins, with no spares, so I would have been pretty screwed, but I really only needed one complete connector (the kit comes with enough parts for two).  If you really need two complete connectors, be careful with those pins, or plan on buying a second set to have enough spare parts to make it through.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDF3K8XS92TD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMSGSQ2#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDF3K8XS92TD","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always preferred to have a large, redundant storage server on my home network, to centralize access to commonly-needed files (e.g., video and music libraries to be accessed from any TV), and to act as a central backup server.  My first experience was with an Infrant ReadyNAS, which lasted a good four years.  Needing more storage and performance, I moved on to the Synology platform, first with a DS1511+, then more recently with the larger DS1815+.  This gives me a pretty good perspective for comparing the performance and feature set of this WD My Cloud, which is priced several hundred dollars below a similarly capacious Synology offering.The first thing to note about the WD offering is the variety of configurations in which it is available.  Diskless is self-explanatory (and the way to go if you want to populate the box with drives you already have lying around), but the 8, 16 and 24 TB configurations are confusingly labeled.  The 8TB version that I received, despite having four bays, comes populated with two 4TB drives, leaving two empty bays for future expansion.  The 16TB version comes fully populated with four 4TB drives, and the 24TB version comes fully populated with four 6TB drives.  This naming convention could be more clearly explained -- it's not even spelled out on the WD Store site.The user interface for this NAS is certainly better than some routers, but doesn't seem as polished as the Synology UI.  It certainly doesn't have the large community of third party app developers that Synology enjoys (and which provides a number of _very_ useful free applications for web hosting, surveillance, automating a lot of common media management tasks, such as SickBeard, Transmission, SABnzbd+, etc. etc.  Google these names if you're not familiar, they're great).  Despite that, the WD My Cloud does offer everything most small business or home users would expect to find in a NAS -- support for all the usual RAID formats (although no RAID 6, which, given the four bays, is essentially replaced by RAID 10).  There is support for all of the usual file sharing protocols (including TimeMachine targets for your Macs), access protocols, and administration features you would expect, and even a quietly-included torrent downloader.There are a few nice hardware features dedicated to improving reliability through redundancy -- there are two power supply inputs (so that a second connected external power supply can take over seamlessly if the first fails), two network ports (for link aggregation or failover support, but not for accessing separate LANs), UPS support via USB (so the NAS can shut down gracefully in a power outage), and cloud integration with Amazon S3 and something called ElephantDrive, with which I have no experience.The device seems to run no hotter nor louder than my Synology devices, and is certainly priced more favorably, although the feature set of this is lacking in comparison.  Synology is developing their NAS platform to the point its very nearly a full-featured OS, whereas the WD My Cloud is more of a storage device with a few extra features bolted on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3000W7K3H9L6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TB8XN2E#wasThisHelpful","R3000W7K3H9L6F","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before receiving this pair of Sennheiser RS 185 headphones, I had been enjoying both the Sennheiser RS 180 and the Sennheiser RS 160 for my television watching needs (in the upstairs gym near my daughter's room, and in the master bedroom, respectively).  I love both headphones, but this pair of RS 185 is even better!My two favorite improvements are the improved control interface on the headphones (the old ones located the power and volume too close together, and too difficult to distinguish by touch), and the automatic-on base unit.  When you're already in bed, and have the headphones and TV on, it's beyond frustrating to get out of bed, schlep to the media center, and power on the transmitter.  This pair alleviates that age-old problem (""problem,"" as used here, means my inability to remember to perform simple tasks).The sound quality on these (I've only tried connecting them with the optical input) is flawless, and like all my other Sennheisers, they're quite comfortable to wear, even for folks with heads as large as mine.  Also like my other Sennheisers, the use of industry standard batteries (AA) instead of some ridiculous $30 proprietary form factor is a nice design choice that demonstrates respect for the consumer.

"I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of this vacuum -- given its light weight, and that it's battery powered, I expected a dust buster level of suction.  But the suction compares favorably with a regular upright vacuum, and the performance of the powered brush roller is similar to other (lightweight) upright vacuums that rely on power cords.  The quick release of the canister from the handle / powerhead is a very nice feature, as is the quick release of the vacuum hose from the powered head (for quickly sucking up messes close to the baseboard.  The two included batteries each last quite a bit longer than I expected (more than 30 minutes of ""turbo"" mode vacuuming), and charge very quickly with the included charger.There aren't many drawbacks to this vacuum, and those that exist are fairly minor, but it's worth mentioning them:The brush roller has a hard time with longer dog hair, which quickly wraps it up -- our larger central vacuum powerhead does a much better job with our Bernese's shedding.There is no way to store all of the accessories on the vacuum - it comes with a crevice tool and a bendy upholstery brush -- only one of them can be stored on the vacuum, and the other has to just sit on the closet floor.The largest item that can be picked up, even with the crevice tool, is fairly small.  Where the vacuum hose enters the canister body, there is a fairly small passage, and things can get stuck there (impacting the suction of the vacuum until they are removed).  For example, I picked up a medium sized (yellow) wire nut with the vacuum, and it got stuck there, necessitating disassembly and emptying the collection canister.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y3KKYXI1NHCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU1HU#wasThisHelpful","R1Y3KKYXI1NHCQ","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Despite a rough first impression, this is a great stapler.  If, however, you're curious to see how the pull force required to fire a staple differs from your old Arrow stapler, I recommend _not_ absent-mindedly driving a staple into a sheet of carboard that you're holding from behind.  I can, however, testify with acutely first-hand knowledge that the staples are driven with quite a bit of force: more than enough to reach the bones in your fingers!That shameful confession aside, this staple gun is easy to use and well made - the amount of force required to fire a staple does not increase dramatically as you get close to the end of the handle pull, meaning it will be much easier to use in awkward spaces where a solid grip is hard to come by.  Loading is also easier than the Arrow staplers I'm used to -- although it took a minute to sort out how to load; instead of loading the staples into the tray that slides out the back, you load the staples into the belly of the stapler once the tray is out of the way, and then slide it back over the staples.  There's a nice lock on the handle that holds it in the closed position (although you appear to have to fire a staple to get it into that position), and a belt clip that's a little too loose to be secure unless you've got a pretty thick belt to hang it from -- just  hanging it from the waist band of your jeans isn't enough to positively secure it.  Finally, the stapler is surprisingly light, but doesn't feel cheaply made despite the lack of heft.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M400O1THPLUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00815IZ0I#wasThisHelpful","R3M400O1THPLUL","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This monitor is the envy of my coworkers -- besides boasting tremendous real estate, it enjoys nicely modern styling (thin bezel, attractive and functional stand), beautifully bright and saturated colors at an impressive 1440p resolution, and a very-well implemented anti-glare coating that is not too textured (some monitors in this regard look like they've been sprayed with a clear orange-peel texture spray), and works perfectly to eliminate reflections from the windows behind my desk.Some caveats -- there is no DVI nor VGA connections on the this monitor, it only accepts the more modern DisplayPort (also Apple's Thunderbolt, which uses the same physical connector) and HDMI.  Converters are available online, in case your computer (like the one provided by my employer) is archaically old.

"First, these headphones are _comfortable_.  With many headsets, either the cups or the band start to get irritating within half an hour or so.

"This Mega Bloks table is a nice addition to our Mega Bloks collection, and really captured the interest of my 3-year old daughter.  The included castle- and princess-shaped pieces make the building experience more imaginative for her, as compared to just the plain blocks that were included with our original Mega Bloks bag.  By itself, this set would have pretty limited building opportunities, but in combination with a more numerous set of blocks, her creativity is unconstrained.

"This ride-on toy is reasonably nice -- it's sturdy and attractive, and includes the usual noise-making buttons that parents so love.  The excavator arm on the back is a nice addition, so that the toy can be enjoyed even when not being ridden.  It should be noted that it doesn't steer at all (there's no linkage from the steering wheel to the front wheels), and therefore isn't the best for riding around a playroom full of obstacles.  Kids have to pick it up, turn it, and set it down (which is not uncommon for ride-ons, but not as nice as the Winnie the Pooh airplane we have with steering linkage).More confusingly, the ""Mega Bloks"" connection with this toy is tenuous -- there's a few small spaces where blocks can be attached (for no purpose that I can see, other than to create unwieldy extensions from a ride-on truck that will immediately fall off if they get more than a few blocks high).  The number of included blocks is low,  since there isn't much to do with them, other than scoop them into the arm and then dump them out, which you can do with any small object, and not just Mega Bloks.Still, it's an attractive and sturdy construction-themed toy that will entertain your little one.  Just don't expect to extend it much with more Mega Bloks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39GLZWQMRCHLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CL15RX6#wasThisHelpful","R39GLZWQMRCHLH","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm very much looking forward to automating lights and outlets in my home, but have been holding off until a more mature and user-friendly solution is available.  Before receiving this lighting starter set for review, I had researched X-10 (antiquated), Insteon and Z-wave (a bit too patchwork and patent-encumbered) and ZigBee (too proprietary) solutions.  None of these seemed mature and future-proof enough to justify the time, money and effort it would take to fully automate all the functions I'd like automated in my home (lighting, climate, & security).The Belkin approach seems more user-friendly than these others, and the price not too bad considering the design philosophy: embedding the wireless controllers inside of the bulbs, rather than the sockets.  Since they're LED bulbs, with a diode that should outlast the other components far better than a filament ever would, that didn't seem like too bad of an idea.  Regrettably, the only light options currently available are Type-A bulbs in a medium-warm color (3000 K or so).  No other bulb shapes (BR30, BR40, PAR38) or colors (5000K) are currently available.  Still, we have a few fixtures that take bulbs of this size, and additional system components would surely be released if the technology catches on.Rather than including a more expensive WiFi chipset in each bulb, the system is built with a WiFi bridge (the ""Link"") that communicates with the bulbs over a less expensive wireless technology -- this necessitates enough bridges to cover all the areas where you want to put bulbs (which do not act as repeaters, as in the more flexible networks provided by Insteon and Z-Wave).  Unfortunately, the range on the Link is fairly small, and quickly drops off if any walls or sturdy furniture is in the way.  For a large home, to fully automate would require a large number of Links, which would rapidly become expensive.For a small automation project, this solution can still be quite nice.  I once had a combination lamp alarm clock (the Philips HF3470 Wake-up light) that would increase in brightness in the morning to wake me up gently (I loved it, but it doesn't work well for couples with different schedules in the same bed).  This set would easily replicate that functionality (assuming you had a backup audible alarm) without the ugly plastic bedside abomination.  Also workable with this set would be a front porch schedule for evening illumination you wouldn't have to remember to run off (although that could more cost-effectively be done with a hard-wired solution like the Honeywell Econoswitch).While this set could work for some small-scale automation projects, the limited range on the Link, together with the cost of additional Links and the limited selection of bulb types, keep this from being the automation  solution I've been waiting for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV0HL0BIAJ28S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMLTUG0#wasThisHelpful","RV0HL0BIAJ28S","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This doll is a hit with my three-and-a-half year old, who loves playing tea with Sofia and hearing her spoken reactions to the various tea cups and cupcakes that can be held up against her face.  Sofia can stand, if carefully positioned, and articulates just at the waist and shoulders.  Her hands and elbows are fixed so that one hand can pass through the loop of a tea cup and bring it up to her face with a shoulder rotation -- this allows my daughter to make believe that she's drinking tea.  Placing either cup, either cupcake, or her bunny friend Clover up near her amulet prompts one of a few spoken responses, that are specific to the item held close.  Additional phrases can be prompted by pressing her amulet, which glows while she speaks (and while, confusingly, she generates the sound of Clover speaking).A few drawbacks: The included basket is not large enough to contain all the accessories (the cupcake stand won't even barely fit by itself, and the picnic blanket eats up a ton of room as well).

"Before receiving this Learning Train set, my daughter was fond of playing with her other Mega Bloks set (the standard building bag available [[ASIN B007GE75HY:here]]), which included just unadorned building blocks and one wheeled block.  This set has dramatically increased her enjoyment of Mega Blocks, because of the additional wheeled blocks (there are three train cars, each a half-height 2x4 block with wheels and a hook on one end and an eye on the other for attaching them into a line), and the decorative stickers that include numbers, number shapes (e.g., 4 circles on a green background, 5 something-elses on a yellow background, etc.), train paraphernalia (luggage, station lamps, etc.), and even a vaguely-train-engine-shaped piece with eyes.The large half-height 4x4 blocks that act as a lid for the included cardboard box make it possible to build large tunnel shapes, and could make the box useable as a container for the bloks (although, being fairly thin cardboard, it would not last long if played with).  We just dumped the bloks into our storage bin with the others, and tossed the cardboard.The included colors vary from those in the classic block set (which include red, yellow, light green, light blue and dark blue).  This set has purple, lavender, orange and dark green as well.  The wheeled blocks roll remarkably well on even very thick carpet.The only drawbacks to this set are: the stickers come on a sheet, and need to be applied (and peel off fairly easily); and the connections between train blocks are not very secure.

I hope to work out a way to get some lead weights into the base piece (there are three pieces that screw together) to improve this issue, but am otherwise very happy with the purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LR8PG7ZBJNFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VAPV6A#wasThisHelpful","R1LR8PG7ZBJNFQ","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this 60"" Vizio for nearly three months now.  For the first 30 days, my only real complaint was that the implementation of the active LED zones (64 zones on the 60"" model) was somewhat flawed.  The halo of white light that surrounds a bright object on a dark background (the most obvious is with white text on black background, such as a movie title card) is not terribly noticeable while the bright object is still on screen, but becomes VERY noticeable when the bright object disappears.  There is a time delay between the content disappearing, and the backlight shutting down, that leaves a bright white blur on the screen for at least a quarter of a second, maybe even a half second, and it's really glaringly obvious.  From what I've read online, it seems as though my set either takes longer to shut down the backlight, or I'm more sensitive to it than most.  Either way, it's an unfortunate effect that I can't stop noticing.Thankfully, this effect is mostly limited to title cards and the like -- most actual video content involves bright objects moving against a dark background, and I don't notice any trailing blur of backlight behind a moving bright object.  It seems that the TV is caught off-guard when a bright object just completely disappears, and it takes longer to turn the backlight LEDs off than it should.It's not clear to me whether this represents a problem with my particular screen, or if its something experienced by other 60"" sets.  I'd be happy to hear from anyone in the comments who has a 60"", so I can know whether to exchange this one or learn to live with it.  For the record, I've implemented the same customization settings as were initially recommended for the 70"" model (which also sports a Sharp VA panel), so I'm not overdriving the brightness setting at the crazy 100% default (42 is what I have it at, 2.4 gamma, etc. etc.).--- UPDATE AFTER 30 DAY RETURN WINDOW CLOSED ----The other problem that I noticed did not crop up until after the Amazon.com 30-day return window closed.  My setup involves a WDTV Live feeding both video and audio through a single HDMI cable to the Vizio tv directly, and the TV outputting the audio via a Toslink optical line to a Marantz NR1403 receiver. This setup allows me to use the receiver to drive larger speakers when I want to watch content that justifies them, or just to use the TV audio (usually the analog output to wireless headphones) when I don't want to use the receiver.  Unfortunately, the TV appears to have some compatibility problems with the audio content of some of my media.  Many local files will have audio ""gaps"" -- sporadic short silences that are glaringly obvious.  These gaps occur whether I output the audio from the TV to the receiver, use the TV speakers, or even use the TV's analog audio output to drive headphones.  It only happens with some file types, always in the same spots, and only occurs when the TV is relied on to process or even pass-through audio.  In reaching this conclusion, I've tried different hdmi cables (no change), different HDMI ports on the TV (no change), a different WDTV Live (no change), factory resets on both the WDTV and the Vizio TV(no change), every setting option under the sun on both devices, including bitstream and PCM formats (no change), playing the same content from the same WDTV device on a Samsung TV (works fine), outputting the hdmi from the WDTV to the receiver first, then passing it on to the Vizio TV (no audio gaps, receiver can decode the file flawlessly), and most frustratingly, scheduling a Vizio service call to replace the mainboard of the television (same audio gaps with the new mainboard).  Therefore, it doesn't appear to be a hardware problem unique to my TV, and it doesn't appear to be a problem with the audio files, rather it appears to be a design defect with the television in processing certain digital audio formats.If you don't need to route audio through the TV, this may never be an issue for you.  And setting aside these concerns (audio and halos), everything else about the TV has been really very nice.  The remote has a well-implemented (IR) keyboard on the backside to facilitate input for the streaming services, which thankfully doesn't interfere with operating the regular IR remote buttons on the other side (I haven't had any problem registering key presses on either side, or accidentally hitting buttons on the wrong side).  The keyboard works so well, I initially wondered if it might be an RF remote, since it seemed to work without pointing it at the TV; as pointed out in the comments, though, you can see the IR emitter when you remove the cover to access the battery compartment.  The upscaling of 1080p content is really very well implemented, and watching a quality 1080p feed on this screen reminds me of the first time I saw the Planet Earth videos on BluRay.  The wireless antenna has no problem picking up the signal from my router two rooms away.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20I167U3KUIUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2FBEG0#wasThisHelpful","R20I167U3KUIUT","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been paying for razor cartridges for a couple of decades now, and would really like an electric shaver that could give me a comfortable, close shave without the recurring costs.  Regrettably, I've never been able to find one.  Even after trying this (admittedly well-built) shaver, I still haven't.I have fairly sensitive skin, I guess, because I have never  been able to keep up a shave-every-day regimen without causing a pretty dramatic breakout on my face.  For the longest time, I've been keeping a MWF shave schedule, and just accepting the TuThSaSu scruff as the price of avoiding bright red razor burn.  Thankfully, I can get away with a day's growth at my job, as  a day's growth on me isn't really all that messy a look.  Shaving a two- or three-day beard with a Mach3 and a wet face is a quick, easy, painless process, and I get good life out of my blades (around two weeks) just by stropping them on the bath towel around my waist as I go.When I first tried this shaver, it was a Monday morning, and I hadn't shaved over the weekend.  Although my beard doesn't come in very very thick, three days of growth will get me some pretty long hairs, and this shaver just absolutely couldn't handle them.  I started with dry skin (post-shower dry with a towel, but in a fairly humid bathroom), and could barely get a single hair cut.  I switched to the usual shave cream, which didn't seem to help matters at all, even making it a little worse (As though the shave cream held the hair flush against the skin).  I gave up and switched to the Mach3, although the few moments of struggling with the shaver had already left me with pretty irritated skin.I tried again on Wednesday with a two-day beard, and just with hot water right after the shower.  This time, it was able to catch and cut hairs, no pulling or pinching, but I had to keep circling over and over and over in the same spots to make any headway, and after five minutes of trying, had maybe thinned my two-day scruff by around 50%.  Giving up again, I got out the Mach3 and shaved away the rest in under a minute.I thought I'd try on Thursday, since the problem seemed to be with longer follicles, and it did seem to have an easier time with one-day scruff, but still would stubbornly refuse to cut down a noticeable amount on the more challenging jawline and lip spots.  I don't have a lot of confidence that a follicle I miss one day will be easier to cut the next, given how it struggles with longer hairs, but I couldn't just keep circling the same spot over and over indefinitely, as even on the slow speed, I could feel the skin growing irritated.In short, I just don't have a face / beard that plays well with electric shavers.  I'd wondered before if perhaps it was because of the quality of the shavers I'd used in the past, but given how nice a build quality this Philips has, I no longer wonder if that's the case.  If you're like me, and have been disappointed by electric shavers in the past, you may not want to place too much hope in this one working better for you.  If you do like electrics, then this one has a really high-quality build, attractive aesthetic, confidence-inspiring cleaning station, and quality travel case.  But as to the most important feature of shave quality?  Well, this one just doesn't work any better for me than anything else I've tried in the last 20 years.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R269J134ATF7H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1E5G9S#wasThisHelpful","R269J134ATF7H1","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This dock makes a really nice addition to the bedside, turning the iPhone into an attractive alarm clock.  The dock only comes with a (permanently attached) USB cable to provide power, so you'll need to provide your own AC-USB power adapter if you want to use the dock merely for charging from the wall.  The interior of the dock is lined with a rubbery soft material that protects the phone from scraping against the (admittedly sharp-edged aluminum), but the distance from the charging plug and the rear surface of the dock is so great that there is no real risk of rubbing (unless you are using a particularly thick case).

"If I hadn't discovered the Sunbeam Therapeutic Heated Mattress Pad, I would have loved this mattress pad unconditionally, mostly because it's nice not to have my comfort level determined by how cold my wife's feet are.  Having a dual zone heated mattress pad is fantastic, right up until you compare it to a six-zone heated mattress pad (at the previous link).  This pad will (reasonably) quickly warm up to the desired temperature(s), and stay there for 10 hours.  All at a very reasonable price, and with minimal wiring fuss.For comparison's sake, the Sunbeam Therapeutic that we've since upgraded to allows you to have six zones (three for each sleeper - head, body, feet), and to keep them heated indefinitely, and uses a (single, unfortunately) wireless digital controller to adjust the temperature zones.  Well worth the (significant) additional cost for the ability to have one person warm their feet, without toasting their bum, while the other warms their bum, without roasting their feet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OSWJNAPT9FDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FHW8RFQ#wasThisHelpful","R3OSWJNAPT9FDP","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love love love my Fujitsu ScanSnap, so I was interested to see how well a device that retails for 1/3 less would stack up against it.  In short, the scanning hardware seems pretty comparable, but the software and Mac support suffers in the comparison.Both the ScanSnap and this WorkForce will quickly devour documents that you feed it.  With the Fujitsu, turning a paper document to a text-searchable PDF is nearly instantaneous (in Mac OSX on a recent iMac), and can be done with a single press of the button on the scanner.  With the WorkForce, the software titles (Epson Scan and Document Capture Pro) are clunky, slow, feel hopelessly out-of-date, and it's difficult to find where the PDF option is (not in Epson Scan), let alone the slow-as-molasses OCR.  I can't speak to the experience in a Windows environment, but for a Mac user, the extra money would be well spent to get access to the Fujitsu's much better software environment.  Should there be third-party software available that could benefit from the rugged hardware (I don't have Acrobat Pro, so I can't speak to this), then this might be a great deal.  Otherwise, three stars for Mac users.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5FEGC2ZOZHDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO58Z5O#wasThisHelpful","R5FEGC2ZOZHDL","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for a great monochrome laser printer with duplexing, this certainly fits the bill, although for less money, you can get a similarly great (and even slightly faster) duplex monochrome laser printer in the Brother HL6180DW, which I have been using for the past year or so.  With this Lexmark, you get the added benefit of scan / fax / copy functionality, although not in a flat-bed arrangement (sheet-fed only).  Considering the steep price premium you would pay for this added functionality, it might make more sense to purchase a more versatile flatbed scanner with the cheaper Lexmark, unless your scanning / copying needs can be handled by an exclusively sheet-fed device like this one.As a printer, this Lexmark is easy to set up (at least in the OSX environment where I use it), very speedy to print the first page, with subsequent pages coming out every 2 seconds or so, and doesn't bog down with big PDFs as much as some other printers (and the expandable memory should ameliorate this, for people that will be churning out lots and lots of graphics-heavy PDFs).As a scanner / copier, it does an adequate job, but can't hold a candle to the speed and convenience and quality of a dedicated scanner like the Fujitsu ScanSnap that is at the heart of my paperless home office.  If you don't have a scanner already, and don't want to splurge on a dedicated device, this will do the job (albeit much more slowly).All in all, a solid laser monochrome MFP (with duplexing, which once you've experienced, you'll never want to do without).","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TEMPH9BGVZJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SM8FG2#wasThisHelpful","R2TEMPH9BGVZJF","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have some serious reservations about this product.* the inaccessible internal battery can only be charged with a non-standard DC adapter.  Once it runs down in a power-outage, there's no charging it again until the grid is back up.* the flashlight handle is on backwards.  Look at the photo -- when you fold the handle down, the ""grip"" portion of the handle is oriented the wrong way, such that you'll be shining the lantern end outwards and the flashlight end in your eyes.* the lantern is pretty dim; much more so than the flashlight.  The configuration of the internal reflector for the lantern casts light out to the sides only -- and the overhanging ""top hat"" lid needlessly casts a larger shadow upwards.  With this amount of light, I presume the lantern mode should run for a long time, but you'd get nearly as much light from a candle.* if you wanted brighter light, you could shine the flashlight at the ceiling; but for unknown reasons there is a non-functional bump on the lid of the lantern that makes balancing the light in this orientation needlessly challengingOn the plus side, the dim LED emitter will probably last a good while, enough to get you through a less-than-one-day power outage.

"The installation of this adapter ring is far more challenging than it should be.  The ring is actually two parts, and each must be installed with its corner tabs _behind_ the device you're hoping to adapt.  This requires some bending and flexing of the ring, and a lot of swearing.  Once the two parts are installed behind the top and bottom of the decora strap, you must secure them with fiddly little screws that are a challenge to line up.  Having done that, you'll find that the leviton plate doesn't _quite_ fit around the adapter ring without a lot of pushing and bending and hitting and more swearing.Some things to note:* the ring sticks up higher than the level of the decora device, and flush with the wall plate.  I used this adapter to help a single gang keystone strap (with network and A/V plugs) blend better on the wall with the other Renu power outlets.  The keystone strap looks ""set back"" into the wall plate (unlike other Renu devices, where the power outlet sticks out past the level of the wall plate).* the outline of the ring is visible between the Renu plate and the decora device - choose an adapter color that matches at least one of them.  I chose a white ring to match the white keystone strap, and it looks pretty good in the warm caramel plate on our tan wall.* I can't be sure (since I installed this on a single gang device), but it looks like the height of the tabs that hold the Renu plate is higher on this adapter than other Renu devices -- if you install it in a multi-gang setup, there might be some issues getting everything aligned at the same height.  That's probably why they require the corners of this adapter to sit behind the decora strap, but it looks like the mounting tabs are still a bit elevated (they can only sit so far back, based on the thickness of the decora device they're surrounding).Still, I'm glad I bought and installed this adapter.  If only Leviton would offer more colors / number of outlets for their QuickPort inserts, that would be better, but in the meantime, this is a good solution.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXNVFABZYC65E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045EOYMW#wasThisHelpful","RXNVFABZYC65E","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But it is nice to have a utility knife that takes up less space for storage in a glove box or small tool bag.  This seems as sturdy as any I have used, and securely locks when open.  The inclusion of a small interchangeable-bit driver on the rear of the handle is a nice addition, for those occasional tasks where you need to do just a _little_ screw tightening or loosening (the shape of the tool does not lend itself well to screwdriving when closed, and it is unsafe to use it in that fashion when open).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QHHNM9JUWY2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CY8BJ06#wasThisHelpful","R2QHHNM9JUWY2T","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As skeptical as I am of (alkaline-battery-powered) electronic locks in high-reliability applications, I've previously steered clear of gun safes unless they are mechanically opening (my favorite is the V-Line Quick Vault that's installed behind a picture frame suspended on a Hangman french cleat).  I once tried the ADG Sports Secure pistol safe, but was gobsmacked at how easily the door would pop open accidentally on that one.This Sentry Safe impresses with its small dimensions (it fits into bedside drawers that the ADG safe would not), its pry-resistant door design (the front lip is turned down to rob a pry bar of its upward leverage), and the speed with which the door opens -- after I programmed a combo, I thought I might have neglected to program the last digit, since it seemed to open before I finished pushing the final button, but it's just that fast.I was also pleasantly surprised by the reliability of the fingerprint programming.  I programmed my two index fingers, which took just a few seconds (the safe keeps re-scanning the same finger until it's satisfied -- it only took me four or five swipes for each finger), and then it reliably opened for those two fingers, and no others, every time I tried.  I haven't owned it long enough to know whether changes in humidity, temperature, or injuries to my finger tips (common when you're clumsy) will impact its reliability.My wife's fingers took quite a bit more training before they would register, and still resulted in a few false negatives (not letting her in) although thankfully no false positives, when we tried it on all the family members who were visiting for Christmas.Still, even if the fingerprint scanner doesn't let you in, there's the programmable buttons that you can use to open the safe (and, obviously, an override key).  My gripe with the safe is about how you interact with the buttons:  before you can input your key code (or scan your fingerprint) you have to ""wake up"" the safe.  You can wake up the safe by either putting your finger on the print sensor, or by pushing one of the buttons.  The first button that you push, however, doesn't count towards your code entry.So, if your code is 1-2-3-4-5 (please don't make that your code), you could not open the safe by pushing 1-2-3-4-5.  You would have to push 1-1-2-3-4-5 or 2-1-2-3-4-5 or X-1-2-3-4-5 (where X is the fingerprint sensor).  Unfortunately, you won't remember this until you've already pushed the first two buttons of your combo, and have to keep pushing buttons until the safe flashes a red light and refuses to open.  Then you can put your combo in again.I imagine this is a battery-saving function (BTW, 4xAA alkaline batteries only, says the manual), but it's a pain.  Why can't the first button wake up the safe AND count towards your combo?  This is enough of a pain that I can't rate it five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H0ANYKQ39IOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXQW672#wasThisHelpful","R2H0ANYKQ39IOC","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As slide scanners go, this one is designed to be pretty user friendly -- no computer required, small color preview screen, and saves to (an included) SD card.  The ""scans"" (really, it's taking a picture of the slide with a small CCD above the slide/negative that's lit from below) are completed very quickly, and the auto-focus and auto-exposure that takes place during scanning seem to do a good job, although the auto-color balance leaves some color-balancing work to be done on a computer.

If you want to capture all the quality that you can out of your slides/negatives, you'll have to spend a bit more, or consider other approaches.It's probably safe to assume that if you're considering buying a slide and negative scanner, it's not because you're still shooting photos on film.  Rather, you have boxes or binders full of old photographs that you want brought up to date.  So a slide scanner is the kind of thing you would buy for exactly one extremely labor-intensive project, and then get rid of.A more user-friendly approach to the box-of-slides-problem would be to utilize any one of a large number of professional slide/negative scanning services, which allow you to mail a box of slides/negatives and get back a DVD with high resolution photos that have been corrected in various ways (scratches, dirt, color cast).  Given the price of this dedicated slide scanner, and the low cost of scanning services (between fifteen and thirty cents per slide), the service might be a better solution (unless the photos you want to digitize number in the thousands).The quality of the resultant scans that this scanner produces is not that high - if you're looking to archive your treasured family photos, and determined to do it yourself, you might be well advised to purchase a more expensive slide scanner (possibly used) and to recoup most of that hardware cost by selling the scanner once you've scanned all your old photos.Alternatively, instead of a slide scanner, you could also use the same amount of money to purchase a reasonably good quality flatbed scanner with a slide/film tray (e.g., this nice Canon), and enjoy the additional features of a flatbed scanner.  The tradeoff there is between speed/convenience and quality/functionality -- it will take a lot longer to scan with the moving scanner head in a flatbed than it will with this speedy dedicated slide scanner, and you'll need an attached computer to scan, but you'll be able to get better image quality and enjoy the other features of a flatbed (document scanning, print scanning, etc.).Judging this scanner on its merits, it is undeniably convenient, fast, and easy to use -- which is exactly the feature set it promises.  It is, however, also a single-use device that will have no role in your house once you've scanned all your slides, and doesn't deliver the highest quality results.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J05KNMBDZSMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B65J5ZO#wasThisHelpful","R1J05KNMBDZSMT","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For our first baby, we used (and loved) the Fisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, which costs nearly 2/3 less than this cocoon.  That bouncer could vibrate and play music, and most importantly could operate like a foot-powered rocking chair that magically soothed a cranky baby long enough to let us eat a hot meal.This cocoon can also rock, either front to back or, by turning the orientation of the seat, from side to side.  The rocking is not as easy to do with one foot as the Fisher-Price model, though, since that one relied on the spring tension of the legs (you could push down, and it would bounce back, and it was easy to get a good rhythm going).This has a few advantages over the Fisher-Price bouncer, that may or may not justify the dramatic increase in cost.  Its material is easy to wipe clean with a cloth (the Fisher-Price was absorbent and needed dis-assembly and machine-washing), it can recline farther back for sleep and farther upright for playtime, and includes a canopy for shading a sleeping child (although this isn't likely to be as necessary for an essentially indoor product).As others have noted, this is a challenge to put together, but since you should only have to do that once, it isn't too big of a deal.  The price is a bit high, however, for what it is, and I would still prefer the Fisher-Price even if they cost the same.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OE2RRT5UEMVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A9OJ60C#wasThisHelpful","R2OE2RRT5UEMVN","A1DB5QPH7WO488","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DB5QPH7WO488?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Aoneky's jump rope is not just for kids. It works great for adults too. It's lightweight, tangle free, and doesn't hurt like a lash if you hit yourself while jumping. The rope is made of a foam type material that resists kinking and tangling. It still firm to keep shape while jumping, but has enough padding to keep it from stinging if you accidently whip yourself with it. The handles are padded and don't slip if your hands sweat.The rope can be adjusted by removing the end caps and sliding the metal clamps down to the length you need. I didn't even need to cut off the excess. I was able to curl it up back into the handle and cap it.Great rope. Perfect portability. Great for taking with you to the gym, travelling, or home. Yes, kids would love this jump rope for play, but I believe the adults would appreciate how comfortable this jump rope is for their workouts as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RA0DXGMGFUJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147WO3M2#wasThisHelpful","R1RA0DXGMGFUJM","A3TPNC3TKGCCEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPNC3TKGCCEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a Halo Master Chief loving kid, these costume pieces are fantastic to feed the imagination with. Granted, it doesn't come with body armor, but this didn't stop my son from using it for Halloween. He found suitable camo underclothes then he asked me to find a brown blanket to cloak himself with. In moments, my son was  cloaked Master Chief from the desert trailer for Halo 5. It looked fantastic!The mask is very well made. It's not a cheap plastic flimsy mold, but a decent solid half mask with a one way mirrored visor. It has stretching adjustable hook n loop straps to hold it comfortably on the head. My son could still wear the mask with his glasses on. It has a thick foam strip for the mask to rest on the forehead so the mask doesn't press on the child's face. The only problems we ran into with the mask is that it tends to fog up after a while. Also, once it gets dark, it much harder to see out of the mask. I had to direct my kid to keep him from running into bushes and trees. (He was persistent.)The fabric gloves are highly detailed, shaped, and lightly padded. They look realistic yet comfortable to wear. My son loves using them often.This set is a huge hit with my 12 year old. No regrets. I'd gladly buy again if anything happened to them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FCKCTVVND5AP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJP7UT2#wasThisHelpful","R2FCKCTVVND5AP","A3TPNC3TKGCCEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPNC3TKGCCEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a BEAUTIFUL children's bible with plenty of cute digital illustrations of children geared for young children. The CEB translation is easy to read and understand. Nearly every page has a side note or commentary to keep children's interests active. Maps are included at the back of the bible. The exterior is plain monotone design with a silky surface that is nice to the touch.I do wish it contained illustrations recreating favorite stories and scenes instead of just children in different playful poses. My old children's bible was choc-full of story scenes like that and I loved it. With this bible, it's mostly kids of different races in different playful poses.I would more or less recommend this bible for young readers up to perhaps 10 years old.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A9QNA5WSDIS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609261917#wasThisHelpful","R2A9QNA5WSDIS6","A3TPNC3TKGCCEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPNC3TKGCCEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The CEB Student Bible is spartan in appearance and format but is easy-to-read and loaded with great information. There is nothing kiddie or child-like about this bible. No cartoons, no illustrations of any kind. (There are color maps in the back.) It's a just a red and black themed CEB bible created for studentsOn the down side, something is amiss with me with the red and black theme of this bible. It's plain. It neither beautifies nor detracts from the bible. It's just there. It's boring visually. Regardless, I've used the bible with my kid's bible study time and I found the CEB interpretation easy to read and the introductions and commentaries really good.Don't judge this book on it's looks alone.

" 2:52 Mins I am writing from a novice point of view regarding this program, but from what I've seen, tinkered, poked, prodded, and slapped, I've come to like Cyberlink's PowerDirector video program. So far, it hasn't bitten me back and I'm slowly learning the curve of the program without being angry or annoyed.Installation was very easy. No issues installing it to my Windows 10 PC. I also like that they made registering the product relatively fuss free. In addition to the program, when you register the product, you get additional online bonuses like 20GB of cloud storage and access to extra online content.I've barely scratched the surface of Cyberlink's Power Director's ability. In my novice fumblings, I've played with the wizard features to help me quickly create an attractive format for my video. The program can utilize both photo and video media files to create your own movie.When you're ready to publish, you have a choice of formats to choose from. The program also has quick settings for different device and different online services. I can upload directly to YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, Daily Motion, and others. The process went quite fast for me. Once I created my 3 minute short video in an HD format, it was rendered in a short time. The uploading to Facebook actually took longer than rendering, but it did upload properly and was available quickly.What got me annoyed so far, when I use the Wizard help, some of the photos were cropped too tight. Even with the special effects zooming out or similar, the majority of the photos in my video were cropped much closer than needed to. Lots of good parts of my photos ended up getting cropped out. Other than than, it still managed to make a great video out of my photographs.Once you start poking around in PowerDirector, you'll find new, cool, different, techie features that get your imagination going. You can create 3D movies, have 4K resolution, precision motion tracking, and more. It's all rather exciting.It's a cool program. It has its quirks with the Wizard feature but still manages to create enjoyable movies to watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRRBRQP5TFY3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01537HQE2#wasThisHelpful","RRRBRQP5TFY3L","A3TPNC3TKGCCEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPNC3TKGCCEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Knit & Love sent me a sample XL sweater in orange in exchange for a fair and unbiased review. I fell in love with it the moment I received it.The material, cut, color and style is stunning all the way around. The material is just right with softness and stretchiness. The orange color is nice and not garish. The toggle buttons are stylish, though  it can be a bit tricky to use. On me, the sweater cuts off nicely above my hips.Not too short, not too long. The fit was a bit snug around the arms, but the over all look and fit is smart and pretty. The toggle buttons are a great stylish touch.This is a beautiful sweater. I look forward to wearing it this fall and winter season in Florida. Thanks to Knit and Love for allowing me to review the sweater.

The worse is usually because of missing pieces which only delays the project building until Mega Bloks sends the free replacements.The Halo Scorpion is another beast of a machine to build, but not impossible. It comes with minifig Buck, red spartan, and an Elite Sangheili. The wonderful addition to the Mega Blok sets is the Req Packs for in-game downloads. The req packs which you can procure from different official halo toys and figures will unlock a different bonus for Halo 5.

"Kerrigan Byrne had me a Chapter One of The Highwayman and there it will stay. I adored the precious friendship/puppy love between Farah ""Fairy"" and Dougan. It will forever be one of the sweetest book passages I will remember. However the book jumps ahead many years and the book became harsh. Dougan is gone and Dorian is living up to keep Dougan's promises. While the story progressed well enough and kept my interest, I found the characters a bit forced and extreme. Their first time together was...hard to read. It was borderline voyeuristic and hardly romantic.However, as a historical romance it still has it's moments and by far not the worst book I've ever read. It was still entertaining to read. Ms. Byrne's earlier supernatural Berserker stories will still be on my all time favorites of books. The Highwayman is fine. I just cannot give it rave reviews. It's a passable read with enjoyable moments. The legend of My Fairy will always be dear to me. It's my favorite part of the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UF5IH6A7F6GL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250076056#wasThisHelpful","R3UF5IH6A7F6GL","A3TPNC3TKGCCEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPNC3TKGCCEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought lipstick was just lipstick until I tried Covergirl's Colorlicious Star Wars Ltd. Ed. lipstick. The Colorlicious went on smooth and has lasted me hours without the temptation to lick or bite it off. The Red-30 color has a pretty semi-matte sheen with a subtle shimmer of gold. It lays down nicely for color that will last for hours. The color is bold but beautiful.I am surprised how long the color has lasted so far. I've been wearing it for hours and have not had the urge to lick or bite it off. What color loss I've had has been due to blotting my mouth with a napkin after eating some food. I'm drinking from a glass while typing this review and not finding color on the glass. The color has pretty much stayed on my lips, not on everything else.I'm impressed by Colorlicious and will definitely consider picking up other shades.

"My son absolutely LOVED the Schleich T-Rex on the Hunt play set. The set comes with a wonderfully detailed Tyrannosaurus Rex, an adorable baby Rex that fits in a semi-transparent egg that opens, and a working jaw T-Rex skull. All 3 pieces are beautifully detailed and rugged; worthy for display as well as for play. The one thing that kind of stands out awkwardly is the plastic egg. It's just a simple toy egg one would find in a vending machine or similar. But, it does the trick. The real beauties are the T-rexs themselves.The adult T-Rex has a working jaw. The skin is incredibly detailed to the tiniest point. The coloring looks great and it's not sloppy at all. She easily stands on her own two feet.The baby T-Rex is small. There's still plenty of details, but not in the same scale as the momma T-Rex. Still, it's adorable!The skull has lots of detail from the rustic hollows on the bone to the spaces on its teeth. The jaw opens and closes so you can display it any way you prefer.Overall, an excellent dinosaur miniature that is classic Schliech quality. Worth getting for any dinosaur fancier of any age.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21WO6S7VRULCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPY6BOO#wasThisHelpful","R21WO6S7VRULCP","A3TPNC3TKGCCEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPNC3TKGCCEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Winkine fashion tassel shoulder bag is an attractive bag that is pretty to wear and practical to use. It's roomy inside with handy interior and exterior pockets and offers the convenience of handles or shoulder strap for the user to choose from. The exterior supple with the right amount of fashionable slouch. The tassels add a nice sassy touch.The interior is split into two big pockets with a short interior fabric wall to separate them. The bag is roomy enough to store two digital tablets and a wallet without any problems and still have room to spare. The short interior fabric separator can be annoying at times as it catches everything and can interfere with trying to get things in sometimes.On drawback for me is that the bag has a bit of weight to it already before use. It won't take much to get it heavy. Once I put in my two Surface tablets (the old heavier models) this bag got heavy quick. Add a bottle of water, keys, wallet and I'm reminded how my life was before I discovered Vera Bradley. I'm also not overly fond of the shoulder strap. It's fashionable, not comfortable.Overall, the Winkine bag is very pretty. I like using it for those times I want to dress more upbeat fashionable than casual. My younger upbeat adult nieces love the style.

"Avery's flag labels are cute to use for straws, pencils, or even making mini pennants to hang on cords. You can create labels in your own word processing program or use Avery's Design & Print online label maker, which is easy to use and has many features to take advantage of.The one on-going issue I have about printing labels, Avery or otherwise, is the alignment/sizing issue. It's always a bit off. In other words, my layout ends up off centered on the actual label printed than what I created on the web. The website allows you to adjust for this, but getting those measurements right can be a time consuming and paper consuming process.One thing I did notice about these labels is that they don't stick hard to each other once you fold them on to itself. This is good if you want to fix a crookedly folded labels. Not so good when you see them not stick fast to the item you want them to stick to. For short term or disposable use, it's not an issue to worry about. However, for something more permanent or long term, this may cause problems.Adorable labels overall.

"Nitrile gloves like these by Ammex are great for rigorous cleaning around the house  or for crafting. The gloves are appropriate for light duty use and are good for guarding against dirt, light scrapes, and scratches. (Sharp objects will pierce the gloves.) What I especially like about these gloves is that my nails won't cut through the gloves when I'm wearing them.

On my cheeks nearer to my mouth, it causes small breakouts to happen. I don't understand this, but perhaps my skin would prefer a lotion over a cream better.

Since he never made any money off of his ""scams"", no charges were ever brought against Landis despite the frustrations of one art curator who was desperate to catch and stop him.

"Tattered and Mended by Cynthia Ruchti is really what the subtitle says it is - the art of healing the wounded soul. The book acknowledges that God is the master artist, and we are His masterpiece. As souls become broken, the author brings you into the awareness that God can heal our souls. Ruchti emphasizes listening prayer, sitting alone with God, and giving God spiritual whitespace as a canvas so that He can do the work of healing our souls. I found the book deeply comforting as a reminder that God can take our damaged souls and turn it into a tapestry of grace and master workmanship if we are willing to let Him do the work.

"I've read two YA retellings of A Thousand and One Nights this year, and A THOUSAND NIGHTS is my favorite.  E.K. Johnston wowed me with The Story of Owen duology, and she continues to impress me here.  The tone and rhythm of this story aren't similar at all, but the control of them is.Lo-Melkhiin has been marrying and killing his wives.  It has reached the tribes have instituted a policy that he has to rotate between them, to help keep one tribe from suffering too much.  When the heroine's tribe must offer a bride, she makes herself as beautiful as she can with flashy clothes and makeup.  For one day she outshines her sister and is picked instead.  In return, her sister starts worshiping her immediately until waiting for news of her death, that she has joined their ancestors.That love between the sisters might be enough to save all of their people.I liked the focus in A THOUSAND NIGHTS on women who are fed up and what they're doing about it.  Lo-Melkhiin has kept peace ever since he came back from the desert a changed man, but it is the women who pay the price.  The heroine and her sister are tired of that, and so are many other women living in fear of their lives.The worldbuilding is also superb.  Johnston imparts the reader with a sense of how families are structured and how their religious traditions work.  We're shown the reasons the people would not rebel against a leader who slaughters so many of his people.  Then, there's the bits of strangeness around the edges.  There's a wig made out of a lion's mane made by Lo-Melkhiin for his mother.  There's a man compelled to make beautiful sculptures, even though it pains him.  There's a sense of the wrongness in the court beyond the deaths.Then there is the battle of wits and wills between Lo-Melkhiin and his bride.  She may not fear as he wants her to, but that doesn't mean she isn't afraid.  There's wonderful interplay between them, as Lo-Melkhiin tries to find out why she can withstand him and she tries to figure out how she can solves the problem of Lo-Melkhiin before she's just another dead wife.A THOUSAND NIGHTS is a story of terror and love in a desert that never was.  It's a book that kept me turning the pages, and I hope it will do the same for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHV39M0B2DKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484722272#wasThisHelpful","R1DHV39M0B2DKM","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Final Girl (not to be confused with The Final Girls) is a stylish horror movie with an increasingly common twist: the girl being chased by killers is highly skilled herself, and the hunters become the hunted.  It's hard to say where the movie goes wrong.Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) shows off her Academy-nominated chops, moving smoothly from scared teenage girl to cold and ready fighter.  Wes Bentley (The Hunger Games) is terrific as her mentor.  Alexander Ludwig (The Hunger Games, The Final Girls) does a fine job as the leader of the teenage killers, even if he is several years to old for the part.  The other three killers manage to differentiate themselves neatly despite all being brunets in suits.  But Final Girl is just cold.Final Girl is the directorial debut of Tyler Shields, a photographer.  His skill shows in every frame of the movie.  The composition of it is beautiful, especially the lighting.  It feels derivative, however.  The color scheme is mostly black, white, and red and there is a retro, fifties noir feel.  It's been done, and the fifties' feel adds nothing to the story.The best scene is probably Danny (Logan Huffman) dancing with his axe, a fun scene that was done even better in Kung Fu Hustle.The story of Final Girl is simple, and yet leaves so many questions.  How did Veronica and William know about these four?  How do others not, if twenty blonde girls have gone missing recently?  There's also the fact that Veronica is supposed to win her fights by being smarter, and yet the movie has her get into a fistfight with Jameson.  As hard as the movie tries, Ludwig is at least a foot taller than Breslin and quite muscular.  I'd love to see her win through wits as the movie promised; the fistfight is just ridiculous.Final Girl looks lovely and boasts several good performances.  But the thin story doesn't have enough detail to support what is there because of the emphasis on style over substance.  There's no tension to the story, and the ideas have been executed better elsewhere.  This was a waste of the cast's talents.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39E7QYMG6NYYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0112HPV9O#wasThisHelpful","R39E7QYMG6NYYE","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gitty Daneshvari, author of the School of Fear series, is back with the first in a new series: THE LEAGUE OF UNEXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN.  While I love the premise, I think this will be the only book in this series I try.THE LEAGUE OF UNEXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN posits that children who are unremarkable, forgettable, utterly average make the best spies.  Very few notice them in the first place, and no one remembers them.  (The book promptly deflates its own premise by having the children accompanied by an adult, because there are many places where unaccompanied twelve year olds are quite noticeable.)The issue for me was that Daneshvari never convinced me that Shelly and Jonathan are completely average.  Shelley's wacky outfits are described in detail, as is her habit of just making up sayings and otherwise saying nutty stuff and trying to take it back.  She's funny, and quirky.  She has an easily recognizable schtick.  She's more Stargirl than Jane Doe.  Jonathan seems a bit more uninteresting on the surface, although surely a kid wearing khakis isn't an identifiable trait with the current school dress codes.  Daneshvari makes it clear that unexceptional kids are not losers, yet doesn't support it well with the text.  Most people (that is, the average) are at least kinda good at one thing.  Shelley and Jonathan seem to have no talents aside from being easily overlooked.The plot centers around a kidnapped Vice President.  The current league members might be compromised, so Shelley and Jonathan are recruited.  They fail their training, but are sent out into the field anyway.  However, they aren't alone: they're teamed up with a pair of exceptionals from Britain.I like the central message of THE LEAGUE OF UNEXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN: everyone has something to offer.  The book is lightly humorous.  Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I just don't think it hangs together.  I'll always love books about kid spies, but this one is a miss for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SX42FN5975IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316405701#wasThisHelpful","R2SX42FN5975IR","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Newbery Honor-winning author Gennifer Choldenko, known for her Alcatraz trilogy, shifts her focus to Gilded Age San Francisco in CHASING SECRETS.  Heroine Lizzie Kennedy is a bright young girl interested in the work of her physician father.  When her family's cook Jing goes missing, Lizzie starts paying more attention to what is happening in her city.I found the facts behind CHASING SECRETS fascinating and appreciated that Choldenko detailed the history and some resources in the back of the novel.  I had no idea that there had been a plague outbreak in modern America.  Choldenko is known for developing a rich historical setting, and she doesn't fall down on that front.  This turbulent time in American history is given its due.As Lizzie starts digging deeper into San Francisco's secrets with the help of her brother and another friend, she's shocked by how many secrets different people are keeping and their motivation for them.  It starts with Noah, Jing's son, who Lizzie finds hiding on the Kennedy property after Jing's disappearance.  At first, she can't believe that Jing didn't trust her enough to tell her about Noah.  Then she starts to realize how the Chinese are being treated.  They are being quarantined in Chinatown, even though white residents are free to enter and leave that quarter - defeating the disease-prevention motive for the quarantine.  People are on the edge of rioting.I liked that Lizzie didn't just listen to her family and others that told her nothing was wrong.  As a girl, she's used to people disavowing the medical knowledge she's learned at her father's side and other things she knows.  She loves her father and uncle, and trusts them, but she trusts her own curiosity and observations more.  She isn't content to just listen to what others tell her, but goes out and investigates.There is a tragic aspect to the ending, which is fitting in a novel about an epidemic, although I'm not sure how I feel about it.  Overall though, I enjoyed CHASING SECRETS.  It is a compelling combination of medical thriller and historical fiction.  I often find historical fiction dry, but Lizzie's story is a juicy one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MXJG9D5I0PRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385742533#wasThisHelpful","R2MXJG9D5I0PRJ","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't often read memoirs.  But when I heard about Yeonmi Park, I wanted to read her story.  She wrote IN ORDER TO LIVE: A NORTH KOREAN GIRL'S JOURNEY TO FREEDOM with Maryanne Vollers, an experienced journalist.  Vollers previously collaborated with such luminaries as presidential Hillary Clinton, and she helps tell Park's story with clarity and a sense of openness.Park was born and raised in North Korea along the Chinese border, a closeness that helped her father smuggle goods - until he got caught.  Park experienced both good times and bad times in North Korea before defecting. She escaped to China only to be trafficked with her mother.  Her sister Eunmi went missing when she crossed earlier.Park's story is one of a family struggling to survive and come back together.  It is also one of illumination.  Very little is known about North Korea due to its isolation.  IN ORDER TO LIVE vividly describes everyday life, from food to traditions to fear of who might be listening to careless words.  Human trafficking is an issue that people like to ignore, sweep under the rug because it is ugly.  Park writes about how the crackdown in China during the Beijing Olympics affected her ability to live as someone without documentation, in fear of being sent back to North Korea.She writes about finally reaching South Korea, and the difficultly of making choices and overcoming childhood brainwashing, as well as the difficulties of trying to get an education after being denied it for so long.  She and many other North Koreans find themselves living a life they weren't prepared for, in a country that doesn't have resources for all of the refugees.I think the subject matter of IN ORDER TO LIVE is fascinating, particularly since much of it isn't available outside of such primary sources.  It is definitely enough to make me overcome my reticence about reading memoirs.  I think Park's story is valuable, and understand why she is driven to share, despite the risk to herself and her family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLSBRWKPOGTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594206791#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLSBRWKPOGTC","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the future, creative industries like fashion and video game design are staffed by teenagers (hired at thirteen) because everyone knows that young people know what is cool.  Marla Klein and Ivy Wilde both rose to the top of their fields, but now their teens are almost over and their afraid of becoming obsolosers.  When Marla loses her prestigious position and Ivy gets threatened by a new pop starlet, the girls start seeing the downside to their world and getting the gumption to fight back.I found that MATERIAL GIRLS took awhile to kick into gear.  I think it was a mix of two things.  Elaine Dimopoulos built a dystopian that took a lot of set up to explain and ground the setting, and both girls start out shallow and unquestioning in order to make their journey more satisfying.  I found that the plot didn't really move until Marla and Ivy met each other.I thought MATERIAL GIRLS was full of good ideas.  The way it mocks trends and commercialism reminds me of Scott Westerfeld's slicker SO YESTERDAY.  I liked the way the girls' revolution came about, and that all the leaders had different ideas about what they wanted to achieve and how.  I liked the messy, slightly ambiguous ending, that doesn't provide the story with unearned resolution.  As the slow start showed, the execution could use some work.MATERIAL GIRLS is the first novel by Dimopoulos, and I think it proves she has talent.  If I were on a court picking the next big thing, I don't think I'd pass this book on to the next level.  I would, however, encourage the artist to keep submitting ideas and honing her craft.  There's a good foundation here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWNORF6N5A7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054438850X#wasThisHelpful","R3VWNORF6N5A7K","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fairy tales do not tell children the dragons exist. Children already know that dragons exist. Fairy tales tell children the dragons can be killed. -- G.K. ChestertonG.K. Chesterton's famous quote offers one look at the way stories interact with childhood.  TELL THE STORY TO THE END focuses on the other side.  It is not a horror novel where things jump out at the protagonist or monsters rise up out of oozing slime.  It is a horror novel that says you might not get your happy ending.I was hooked from the title alone.  It could be a positive affirmation, but combined with the smooky and shadowy cover, it is delightfully sinister.  The book opens with Oli, a young boy, speaking with Eren, a strange creature that wants him to tell stories.  Each chapter opens with more of this ongoing conversation, then flashes back to how it came to happen.  There are stories within stories, as Oli gathers more to tell to Eren.  Perhaps the most important is Oli's own story, the one he has to seek out because all the adults in his life are lying to him.  There is something going on with his father, but no one will tell him.The sense of creeping doom is well captured by debut author Simon P. Clark.  The opening makes it clear that things are going to come to a head, but he doesn't rest on that self evident truth.  The world of Oli's dreams starts seeping into his waking hours.  Whatever the reader believes is or isn't actually happening, it is clear that Oli has gotten himself into trouble and is only digging deeper.TELL THE STORY TO ITS END is a lovely little horror story about a boy falling prey to the danger lurking just upstairs.  He notices more than the adults want him to, and at the same time they fail to notice enough.  As everyone tries to help Oli with his struggles moving to the countryside and missing his dad, no one suspects something more sinister lurking.  This is a tale to keep you up at night.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BKD4IOPNWZ48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250066751#wasThisHelpful","R3BKD4IOPNWZ48","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clementine has been to the center of her planet and back.  She expected to find a better life, but instead found corruption and a horrific plan to sacrifice everyone on the Surface to save those in the Core.  She joined a rebellion, but recently discovered a truth that changed everything, and an external threat that just might be more of a danger to her people.I must admit, I was worried that the aliens would let Commander Charlie and the other officials off the hook.  Invading aliens with advanced technology would be a reason for some to resort to extreme measures.  I think there's never a reason for the kind of medical experimentation that they were doing, but at least it is more of a reason than they were doing it because they're the bad guys and thus do bad things.I've been looking forward to the arrival of the aliens since the end of EXTRACTION, when their existence was revealed.  REBELLION dealt with the eponymous rebellion instead of picking up that thread. While I was quite satisfied by the alien's appearance in EVOLUTION, I wish Stephanie Diaz had seeded some more information about them earlier in the trilogy.  I was really interested in their past interactions with humans and sad that that was only a fact in this book.I continued to enjoy Clementine and Logan's relationship, as well as the refreshing lack of a love triangle.  There are not many YA dystopians without one.  Both of them are ridiculous about offering to sacrifice themself for the other, but I believed in their connection and their worries.I can't say I'll ever be a dystopian fan, but I truly enjoyed the Extraction trilogy.  I think it is because it leaned more towards the science fiction end of things, and really expanded beyond the government versus one special girl.  I look forward to seeing Diaz's next novel, now that her debut trilogy is done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UA8PWBXZY433/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250041260#wasThisHelpful","R2UA8PWBXZY433","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AN APPRENTICE TO ELVES is being billed as the conclusion of the Iskryne trilogy.  I'd hoped for more books in this series, but this is a good note to go out on.  The Iskryne books are inspired by Viking history, with elves, trolls, and companion wolves thrown in.  The first book detailed the world and the battle with the trolls, and the second book bought in a new human threat - the Rheans, who are basically Romans.Once more, the book is told by new narrators.  AN APPRENTICE TO ELVES alternates between Alfgyfa (the daughter of the first narrator, Isolfr), Otter  (a former slave rescued in the second book), Fargrimr (a sworn son who is the jarl of the heall closest to the Rhean invasion), and Tin (an elf smith who brokered the alliance between humans and elves with Isolfr).  This helps expand the world and showcase more lifestyles of the people within it.  It is the first book with female narrators, so many of the points of view were much needed.  I did feel like the Rheans delaying their invasion for more than a decade was mostly so that Alfgyfa could become old enough to narrate.But overall, I enjoy the way the Iskryne trilogy has grown and changed since the first book.  The first book, A COMPANION TO WOLVES, felt like a commentary on Pern and how the dragon relationships worked.  Over THE TEMPERING OF MEN and AN APPRENTICE TO ELVES, it has become its own series, with complex relations between and within species.  I loved that this book was not all war, but also an examination of how the two groups of elves broke apart and a fierce drive to bind men and elves closer together before their alliance crumbles without an external threat.AN APPRENTICE TO ELVES is not a fast-paced novel.  It ends with several big battles, a thrilling finish that had me racing to the conclusion.  But that is not the pace of most of the novel.  This is a series interested in ferreting out details of the characters and their place.  As I said, I'm sad that this will only be a trilogy because I feel like there is so much of the Iskryne to explore.  If this is where it ends, though, I'll be satisfied.I think you can read AN APPRENTICE TO ELVES on its own, but you'll miss many worldbuilding details and some of the characters' histories if you do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GRQT9FPRLEF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V34YHQ0#wasThisHelpful","R3GRQT9FPRLEF7","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I keep passing BEYOND CLUELESS in my Kindle and thinking, ""What book is that?  It's marked that I read it.""  Then I open it up and remember.  ""Oh yeah!  That one.""  BEYOND CLUELESS was a cute little read (with a subplot about sexual assault), but the details just keep falling out of my head.Marty and Jimmy always thought they'd be best friends for life, but two recent events have strained their friendship.  Marty's parents sent her to an all-girls school and Jimmy came out and started making new friends in the local gay community.  Marty finds a way to bridge the old and the new by joining her school's performance of Into the Woods.  Boys are needed for the musical, so some of Jimmy's friends can be in it and the rest can be crew.  And Marty definitely thinks things are looking up when she's cast as Little Red Riding Hood against the very attractive Felix Peroni as the Wolf.  (Clearly, she doesn't take that as a symbolic bad sign.)I liked that both Marty and Jimmy made new friends once they were separated.  Jimmy takes to it a little bit better, but Marty does find other girls she can hang with, especially Xiang.  I also enjoyed Linas Alsenas explorations of her failures to be socially adept, such as when she ostracizes someone herself even though she didn't mean to be cruel.  Her difficulties navigating what other people are feeling felt realistic.  So did her trouble understanding and articulating her own feelings, especially when she got something she thought she wanted only to discover she wasn't feeling it at all.I think BEYOND CLUELESS will appeal to young theater fans, especially since it doesn't ignore the importance of the crew.  Jimmy's relatively easy coming out probably holds more appeal than more dated portrayals.  Marty's difficulties with her relationship with Felix are handled well.  Generally, I can't point to anything in BEYOND CLUELESS I didn't like.  Remembering that I read it is the only problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP91ZVUF2NED6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419714961#wasThisHelpful","RP91ZVUF2NED6","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Luke Manchett's father left him and his mother.  Luke hasn't even spoken to him in years.  However, he has just received news of his father's death - and a rather large inheritance.  Tempted by the money, Luke doesn't pay too much attention to the papers he's signing.  But then the ghosts start showing up.I thoroughly enjoyed 13 DAYS OF MIDNIGHT.  There's a nice balance of horror and humor.  I found Luke sometimes frustrating, since he takes a ridiculous amount of time to clue into the danger he's in.  He might not have intended to inherit a host of ghosts and dark necromantic powers, but he had plenty of opportunity to notice everyone warning him that things could go horribly awry.  Luckily he finds help with Elza, the school weirdo who just happens to have second sight and be a low-level witch.  With her, Luke isn't completely hopeless.I did like that the reader figures out what is going on and how the necromancy works along with Luke and Elza.  All is revealed at the end, but it takes time since the reader is thrown into the deep end with Luke.  I love books that let you put together the pieces on your own.  I also liked that the adventure in 13 DAYS OF MIDNIGHT wrapped up neatly while still leaving a wicked hook for sequels.  I hope there are more books coming, because it looks like Luke has more terrifying things lurking in his future.While 13 DAYS OF MIDNIGHT is a horror story, it's not a scary story.  It's a ghost story, and a creepy one, with some macabre imagery and heroes forced to use awful measures to prevent worse things from happening.  It's a kind of horror that I enjoy very much.13 DAYS OF MIDNIGHT is a book that will remind you to always read the fine print before making a deal with a lawyer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LGIXT09YOZ9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763678651#wasThisHelpful","R3LGIXT09YOZ9S","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of the Twisted Tales series strikes me as brilliant: Disney allowing their versions of classic stories to be retold as dark YA novels.  The heroes and heroines of Disney stories are teens, and there is often room for things to go horribly awry.  In A WHOLE NEW WORLD, Jafar gets the lamp as soon as Aladdin steals it, leading to the rise of a dark rule in Agrabah.Unfortunately, A WHOLE NEW WORLD is not good.  The first 22% is a retelling of the movie events written in a competent but not particularly engrossing style.  When things finally start to diverge, the tone just doesn't work.  The beginning was basically the light cartoonish style of the movie, so the darkness also begins strangely cartoonish.There's also the fact that nothing in A WHOLE NEW WORLD really evokes the movie.  When Jasmine and Aladdin talk, I can't hear their voices in my head.  The fate of Agrabah is at stake, and yet I can't get a feel for the city even with Liz Braswell expanding it and diving deeper into the underworld of the Street Rats.  Everything feels vaguely modern and American, down to details like Jasmine mentioning a dog as a common pet.  I was bland, as if a few details pasted in from the movie were enough to make the setting work.A WHOLE NEW WORLD isn't completely irredeemable.  Braswell makes Jasmine an equal protagonist who earns the right to rule and works hard to rescue herself and her city.  I appreciated that she leaned in to the feminist potential of Jasmine refusing to be forced into marriage.  That's about the best compliment I can offer this novel.For such an amazing premise, A WHOLE NEW WORLD came off as ill-conceived and hastily done.  It's not a very good book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZBN0TY4BZRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148470729X#wasThisHelpful","RYZBN0TY4BZRF","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Robin Hobb has a new trilogy coming out, I always get excited when it is time to buy the new book.  You can double that when it is a book about Fitz.  (This is the eighth book starring Fitz and the fifteenth set in this world.)  FOOL'S ASSASSIN, the first book in this new trilogy, made some choices I wasn't so sure about.  I'm still not sure about some of them - the new narrator speaks much less in FOOL'S QUEST and I'm not sure her separate point of view is actually needed.  Others are swiftly corrected, teaching me to trust again that Hobb has a plan.FOOL'S QUEST ends with our heroes once more in peril, so I know I'll be on tenterhooks for the third and final book in the trilogy.  Those who were worried about the characters at the end of book one can look forward to long, soothing passages of recovery.  (Well, recovery for some characters anyway ...)  There's also some delicious, long-awaited vindication.  There were so many moments in FOOL'S QUEST that I've been waiting for as a fan of these characters.And then Fitz does something else to prove he's too stubborn to learn easy.As a fan, I continue to think that this trilogy is a delight.  I'm not sure it has much to offer newcomers, because it is more uneven than the previous two trilogies and generally expects the reader to be familiar with a large number of events and characters.  But seriously, it's worth starting at the beginning and working through these bricks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F0KDOOR90F9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553392921#wasThisHelpful","R1F0KDOOR90F9K","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A HISTORY OF GLITTER AND BLOOD is an aptly named novel.  Half of it is a disco teenage fever dream and the other half is haunting violence and mutilated bodies.  It is a strange novel and I absolutely loved every second of it.The narrator of A HISTORY OF GLITTER AND BLOOD is an unreliable fellow.  He centers the story around Beckan, although he isn't her and cannot know the minutiae of her days and thoughts.  (She points this out to him, even.)  He also admits frequently that he's making stuff up, or eliding a nasty bit of the story, or doubles back on himself because he's not telling it well.  It takes a bit to get into the rhythm of the story, but I thought the way it was told in fits and starts suited the subject matter.Beckan and three other faerie teenagers were the only faeries who survived the war.  (Except not really, because Cricket is dead.  Not dead-dead, because faeries are immortal.  But he's been rendered into pieces so small, conscious somewhere, that his friends can't find them.)  Beckan, Cricket, and Cricket's brother supported the household through prostitution.  Of course, the main people they could sell themselves too were the trolls, who eat faeries.  It's taken a toll on them, both because they were all too young to handle any of it and they feel a mix of blame and shame and not regretting it at all because they survived.There is such horror in A HISTORY OF GLITTER AND BLOOD.  There are images in this book that haunt me.  And the characters, faerie and troll and other, wormed their way under my skin.  The worldbuilding is both deft and dreamlike.  It is a tale of an impossible place, yet all the pieces fit together.  I loved the complicated situation between the races and the lengthy exploration of what happens after trauma and disaster.I've been meaning to read Hannah Moskowitz's novels forever, and A HISTORY OF GLITTER AND BLOOD definitely convinced me that I need to give her backlist my full attention as soon as I get a chance.  This book shoved it's way into my heart like sudden violence following on the heels of laughter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WF8NGWMHX6J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452129428#wasThisHelpful","R2WF8NGWMHX6J9","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebecca Stead won the Newbery Award for her second novel and became the first non-British author to win the Guardian Award for her third novel.  It's quite the pedigree, so expectations are understandably high for GOODBYE STRANGER, her fourth novel.GOODBYE STRANGER mostly focuses on a group of thirteen-year old girls.  Like its protagonists straddle the world of children and teens, GOODBYE STRANGER straddles middle grade and YA.  It is a book that lives in liminal spaces.  Bridge, who narrates the most often, survived a horrific accident and has internalized that that means she's meant for more.  But more what?Her best friends Emily and Tabitha seem to be growing away from her, and all three struggle to navigate the changes in their friendship.  Emily has physically matured the fastest, and she's getting resulting attention from guys.  Tabitha, meanwhile, has fallen into the first blush of feminist fervor.  Sherm is a boy who tells most of his story through letters to his grandfather that he doesn't seem.  An unnamed narrator tells her story aside from the others, in a different time and an older place but still struggling with past friends and who she wants to be with or without them.The threads of Bridge, Sherm, and You's stories come together in delightful ways.  Stead writes with a deft lightness that conceals just how much work she's doing to make all the pieces fit.  It also helps keep the book suitable for younger readers while appealing to older ones.  The darkest storyline in GOODBYE STRANGER involves scandalous photos texted between an underage girl and guy.  It's tackled perhaps with too much optimism, but I liked how the consequences and hurt were dealt with in a way that made it clear that made it clear that many dumb decisions were made but that it wasn't wrong for the girl to have sexual feelings.GOODBYE STRANGER is another terrific novel from a celebrated author in children's fiction.  There's definitely a reason to get excited about a release from Stead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R100FDB2CIKH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385743173#wasThisHelpful","R100FDB2CIKH8","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been looking forward to Zen Cho's debut novel.  Her shorter works have showcased her command of language and character.  Her novella The Perilous Life of Jade Yeo is probably what she's best known for, and who wouldn't want to be known for writing such a humorous delight?  (It's available for free on her website, by the way.)  Even if I wasn't familiar with Cho, I would want to read SORCERER TO THE CROWN.  The cover is gorgeously subtle, the title is evocative, and the back promises a possible murder, magical mysteries, and a runaway orphan.That runaway orphan, Prunella Gentleman, is the runaway character for me.  She's been raised in a school for magical girls, where she exists somewhat between classes - not a servant, but not a student.  (Especially not since it is clear that her mother wasn't white, as her father was.)  Prunella is just barely a grown woman with no money to her name, but plenty of intelligence and some untrained magic.  She knows she has to secure her own future, and so she pursues it.  Prunella performs one of the most cold-hearted acts in SORCERER TO THE CROWN, but she never lost my sympathy.(The secondary character that stole my heart was Mak Genggang, an older and most formidable woman.  Also, an excellent source of comedy due to her refusal to bow to English social rules.)Zacharias Wythe is the eponymous sorcerer, and that position is giving him much grief.  His appointment wasn't popular, especially since he is the first black sorcerer in England.  When his mentor died, he was the only person present, which adds to the dislike, as does the fact that English sorcerers are finding they have less and less magic to work with and it is easy to blame the man in power.  He's a romantic figure, with his quiet dignity and pursuit of duty as he sees it.  (He's rather progressive, so many of the men under him see his duty differently.)Cho uses a very mannered style for SORCERER TO THE CROWN that evokes the historical time period of the setting and reinforces her themes of class and social mobility.  She's created an intriguing alternate history, where magical diplomacy is as important as martial.  In fact, all of the English sorcerers in the story are bound by what they can do given that they and the French sorcerers have agreed not to get involved in the current war.The largest weakness, if you want to look at it that way, is the plot.  SORCERER TO THE CROWN is about the characters and their relationships - romance, fidelity, hatred, rivalry - these are the things that drive the story.  Many problems are presented and do get solved, but the focus is less on how they are resolved than who and why.  The plot is a distant concern to what Cho is trying to accomplish with the novel.SORCERER TO THE CROWN is the first in a trilogy, but stands completely on its own.  I look forward to the second book and I'm eager to see what aspect of the characters' lives Cho explores next, but I would be satisfied with SORCERER TO THE CROWN even if the other two books never materialize.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LQEWLOOMFVU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425283372#wasThisHelpful","R2LQEWLOOMFVU1","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: ANOTHER DAY can be read independently of EVERY DAY.  I have read EVERY DAY, so this review contains spoilers.Spoilery note: A considers themselves to be the gender of the body they're currently in.  I could switch pronouns to reflect this, or default to one gender, but I intend to identify A gender neutrally.  This is not a reflection of how A identifies, just shorthand for this review.ANOTHER DAY covers the same time period as EVERY DAY.  Rhiannon and A meet (although she doesn't know it), and their love story goes from there.  Some people may not want to read a repeat of events, but I think Rhiannon's point of view is sometimes more interesting than A's.  She's less philosophical, a normal girl suddenly faced with the unexplainable.I do wish ANOTHER DAY had started a little earlier.  Rhiannon and Justin's relationship has soured, but Rhiannon still thinks it is worth fighting for, so she doesn't give up even though Justin treats her horribly.  It makes more sense while inside her head than A's, but it might make even more if we got a glimpse at the good days.  I do like that ANOTHER DAY concludes with Rhiannon forging her own path, seeking what she wants instead of trying to deliver what her significant other wants.  It's also a great hook for a straight-up sequel.I liked that Rhiannon had a mix of mundane and more fantastical struggles.  Her friends don't like her boyfriend - standard high school stuff.  Her significant other is a different body every day - not so normal.  Sometimes she isn't physically attracted to the person she's in love with?  Somewhere between the two.  (And I liked that David Levithan worked to course-correct the fat-shaming in EVERY DAY.  Rhiannon isn't turned off by that body, but she is turned off by the way A is ashamed of it.)Rhiannon's growth throughout ANOTHER DAY is wonderful.  She's a bit of a doormat at the beginning, and struggles with respecting herself for a long time.  She's a terrifically real young woman, although A's instant and intense attraction seems rather inexplicable at times.  In the end, I thought Rhiannon's point of view was just as strong as A's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L83YO2NR3NQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385756208#wasThisHelpful","R2L83YO2NR3NQ7","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to remember now why I picked up IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME.  I think it was the promise of time travel, which I tend to enjoy.  But the blurb hints at one of my major problems with the book.  IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME falls into that old pattern of successful, self-made woman figures out what she really needs is to be emotionally honest and find her soulmate.In the end, I think IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME did some interesting things, but they tended to be too little, too late.  The execution of the beginning didn't grab me.  When Ramie wakes up after her disastrous 38th birthday party as a seventeen year old, she falls into a tendency to repeat information over and over as if the reader might've forgotten a detail from the previous two pages.  The timeline also doesn't quite work.  Ramie is clear that the first time she lost her virginity was six months after her eighteenth birthday, but that she and the guy broke up at their graduation party a few days after her eighteenth birthday.The biggest problem is that all of the interesting stuff is rushed and crammed into the ends of the novel.  IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME starts to complicate things and introduce the idea that Ramie is driven and motivated and wouldn't be happy as just a housewife having children.  Her career doesn't get completely jettisoned, which I definitely appreciated, but the actual romance ended up being just a sketch of an idea after her romantic life was built up so much.IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME has some interesting ideas, but I just couldn't get invested.  Does any almost forty-year-old woman really think that her high school boyfriend might've been the one?  I don't think Ramie was fulfilled at the beginning of the novel, but I was never convinced that focusing on her high school romance was a good focus for reflecting on her regrets.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20PMMWZCFUHGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043816#wasThisHelpful","R20PMMWZCFUHGM","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While bored and searching for a movie to watch I stumbled upon Barely Lethal.  It attracted me with its cast, which includes Oscar-winner Hailee Steinfeld, Sophie Turner, and Samuel L. Jackson.  I was hoping for a hidden gem, which I didn't find, but it did relieve my boredom for an hour and a half.Steinfeld plays 83, an orphan raised to be an assassin.  However, she'd much rather be an ordinary girl.  When she gets a chance, she fakes her death and then attends high school as an exchange student from Canada.There are good moments in Barely Lethal.  There's a running joke about Ke$ha perfume that just gets funnier and more absurd as it goes on.  I don't know if it was paid product placement, but it worked.  Steve-O makes a hilarious cameo as a torturer who really gets 83, now going by the name Megan Walsh.  And Megan's host family has great chemistry with her.  I was only familiar with Dove Cameron, who plays the daughter, from an ice-cream video song one of my younger cousins made me watch.  But she does a good job building up a sisterly rapport.Unfortunately, there's lots of clunky moments.  83 gets most of her knowledge from nineties teen films, plus Mean Girls.  She seems not to notice that Mean Girls updated a lot of the tropes she follows.  She also is shown reading up to date magazines, but seems to take fashion inspiration from the parts of the eighties that aren't currently in style.  Also, everyone makes fun of her makeup from her terrible first day of school appearance when the problem is her hair and outfit.  It seems like a top spy would be better at researching and blending in.  I was up for some lampooning of teen movie tropes, but Barely Lethal was just so awkward about it.I like Sophie Turner on Game of Thrones, but she seemed rather stiff as 84, who has a one-sided rivalry with 83.  Her character is supposed to be icy, but just felt a little off.  Maybe it was the American accent they made her do.  Jessica Alba's villain is thinly written, but I did appreciate that a former teen actress was cast for the role.  It was a nice meta joke.  (I liked the casting over all, which mostly has actual teens playing teens.  Some of the guys were older.)Barely Lethal is a cute enough movie to watch in the background or if there's nothing else on.  It's mostly family friendly, although there are a few jokes that earn the PG-13 rating.  It's just bland, which is a waste of a talented cast.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U2PXL4188EZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YN6XAFO#wasThisHelpful","R1U2PXL4188EZO","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think many reviewers other than myself will compare FUZZY MUD to HOLES.  It's the obvious comparison.  Both involve disparate plot threads coming together, strong social messages, and young heroes with the strength to do the right thing.  FUZZY MUD feels like HOLES, even though it is a less complex and ultimately less successful novel.  No shade - HOLES is practically perfect.Tamaya Dhilwaddi had my heart from go.  She's smart and follows the rules and has trouble making friends.  I definitely remember that difficulty of trying to figure out what I was doing wrong as a kid.  She's friends with seventh-grader Marshall Walsh, who is two years older and who won't interact with her during the school day.  They just walk home together.  Then they take a shortcut through the woods one day, because he wants to avoid the school bully, Chad.But Chad goes missing and Tamaya gets sick.FUZZY MUD builds up the dread of what is lurking in the woods wonderfully, repeated equations giving a small sense of the scope of what is happening.  Court transcripts hint at what is waiting and how it was allowed to happen.  (At the end, these transcripts also reveal an imperfect compromise.)  The environmental message doesn't seem so preachy when wrapped up in a nice layer of horror and an ending that isn't nice and neat.  It also helps that Tamaya is a compelling main character who can make her actions come across as more important than the message.FUZZY MUD is a great introduction to some complicated scientific debates regarding the creation, manufacturing, and regulation of biofuel.  It's also a great story about bullying and forgiveness and courage.  It is written for a slightly younger age group than HOLES, and I think it hits the mark.Spoiler: The dog dies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CAJ76JFMUIKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385743785#wasThisHelpful","R1CAJ76JFMUIKK","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"TANGLED WEBS is the first historical novel by Lee Bross, who has also written YA under the name Lanie Bross and NA as L.E. Bross.  It is a rather flawed novel, particularly in the way that characters disappear until they're suddenly needed for the plot.  At the same time, I found it hard to put TANGLED WEBS down.Arista works for Bones, who bought her from the orphanage when she was a child.  She acts as Lady A, the face of his blackmail operation.  Everyone knows her mask, because she's the only one who has personal contact with clients.  She takes all the risk with only a knife and her best friend Nic to protect her.  When TANGLED WEBS opens, Arista is falling out of love with Nic because she is more desperate than ever to escape Bones and go straight, and she has realized that Nic wants to become Bones and loves this life.Sooner than she expects, Arista has her chance.  But she ends up working for a man who just might be worse.  Grae, the son of a merchant, might be her only way out.  Associating with Arista might ruin him, however.It's a tangled web of a plot, with lots of clashing motivations.  It's juicy stuff, and the setting of London in 1725 provides as intriguing social milieu.  I rather liked Arista, who is good with a knife and not a bad thief, but who is desperate to find a way to break her way free without losing her soul.  She wants redemption as much as she wants escape from the men who seek to control her, and that morality limits her choices in a good way.I did appreciate that TANGLED WEBS mostly escapes the dreaded love triangle, despite their being two men in Arista's life.  At the same time, she goes for and spends the most time with Grae, who is a rather straightforward sort.  I can see why she likes him: honest, honorable, loyal.  Nic, who she is in the process of getting over, drives the plot forward and actually has some ambiguity to him.  He and Arista share a tight past, but is he still her friend or has he decided she's expendable?  He's a source of internal and external conflict, and yet he disappears to give space to a straightforward romance.Lee Bross can definitely write the historical side convincingly and spin a plot that keeps the pages turning.  TANGLED WEBS has a bit of a character problem, one that hopefully can be course-corrected in the next book in the series.  There's potential here, for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3899EBO92VSZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423184238#wasThisHelpful","R3899EBO92VSZ8","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The beginning of GHOSTS OF SHANGHAI is rough.  I liked the description of Ruby and her friends catching a fox spirit, but then the story moves back and forth in time rapidly to catch the reader up to what they need to know about Ruby's history and what's coming next.  It's a rather choppy and disorienting beginning.  But then GHOSTS OF SHANGHAI begins to find its groove.One of GHOSTS OF SHANGHAI's biggest strengths is the setting.  It is the 1920s, and the Qing Dynasty has passed but the People's Repulic of China is still on the horizon.  It's a time of great tension.  It's dangerous for Ruby, since she is foreign, although she has one advantage over her parents: she speaks Chinese.  It's dangerous for her two best friends, who are communists.  Then there's her other friend, whose family was killed by communists.  Violence is brewing even before you throw supernatural nasties into the mix.Ruby and her friends like to hand out at the old White Cloud Temple, and they're the only ones who can see that something supernatural is happening.  But then a new caretaker comes to the temple and starts to teach them how to face these creatures, instead of relying on an old book with no context.  (A dangerous prospect, indeed.)And then you throw some mobsters and a kidnapping into the mix.I really enjoyed the density of the plot of GHOSTS OF SHANGHAI.  There's lots of juicy historical fiction details, including multiple corrupt governments clashing against each other.  There's also lots of great cultural details, including how people get treated differently based on how they're perceived.  Ruby is a bit too good at transcending some of those barriers, but she is the protagonist in a book.  I liked the mythological details too, which draw from Chinese stories and traditions.I wish GHOSTS OF SHANGHAI had a smoother start, but it levels out into a layered treat.  I believe there are sequels to come, and I look forward to Ruby's future adventures in Shanghai.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LTPHLW3EV9XY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTY0KT6#wasThisHelpful","R1LTPHLW3EV9XY","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Will Walton's debut novel ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN is sweet, if rather uneventful.  Tretch is closeted and deeply in love with his straight best friend, Matt.  Lots of people joke about them being gay, since Matt has two dads, and Tretch is torn about the fact that he secretly wishes it were true.ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN is a terrific character study.  Tretch is a nice kid and it is heartening to see him grow confident in himself and open up to his family and friends (old and new).  I can see ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN being cathartic for teens struggling with the same issues that plague Tretch.  Do you tell someone you have a crush when you know they won't reciprocate?  Will your religious parents accept you?There's potential for conflict in ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.  Beyond the issue of coming out (or not), Tretch has another secret: he loves to dance and choreographs dances to his favorite songs.  There's also Matt's new girlfriend, who Tretch feels jealous of.  Or there's the girl whose abrasiveness is hiding her crush on Tretch.  But everything comes to a head in a soft, gentle manner.  This is just a very soothing sort of book, the kind that tells you things will work out alright even when they seem dire at the time.ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN is a pleasant read, with its optimistic realism.  It is not for those who are looking for an eventful, plotty book, but it is not without its charms.  Sometimes short and sweet gets the job done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFQP0Y4C3XA0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545709547#wasThisHelpful","RFQP0Y4C3XA0I","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Craig Thompson is the author of numerous acclaimed graphic novels, including BLANKETS and HABIBI.  His first graphic novel for young readers is a heartwarming tale of family, both the kind you're born with and the kind you find, and whale diarrhea.  All in all, it's a space adventure that all ages can enjoy.Violet, her mother, and father live happily in a space trailer park.  He salvages whale poop, which is used for energy.  Her mother works in fashion and just got a job on a satellite, a job that could move their family up in the world.  I think the class conflicts that run through SPACE DUMPLINS are well done.  There are arguments kids might've heard in their own homes, but translated into space (which makes everything more exciting).  The environmental themes are also presented well, just goofy enough not to be overly heavy handed.My favorite thing about this graphic novel might be all the puns.  I think I'm going to have to read it again to make sure that I get all of them.  There's a lot of cleverness flying about in the text and the images.  Thompson's space is a busy place, full of activity and bright colors.  (The contrasting colors make it easier to see what's happening.)  There's all sorts of details to distract and catch your eye.  I think the hyperactive style suits the wackiness of the story as well as the age group.I don't think SPACE DUMPLINS will be a graphic-novel classic like BLANKETS or HABIBI.  But it is fun, sweet, and silly.  That makes it a pretty appealing read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNLE0DBW1WW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054556543X#wasThisHelpful","R3VNLE0DBW1WW3","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That leads to scratching, which is bad.This lotion is cooling and provides a nice relief, although the anti-itching effect doesn't last more than a few hours.

"Peter Ss is a three-time Caldecott Honoree and a Hans Christian Anderson Award Winner.  ICE CREAM SUMMER makes it easy to see why his children's books are so celebrated.The text is a letter from a boy to his grandpa, explaining all the fun things he's doing this summer.  He's learning about math and maps, for instance.  The illustrations deepen the text, and show how the boy is approaching his studies in more detail.  Everything relates back to ice cream.  How many scoops does he eat, and how many scoops does his dog eat?  Which civilization ate ice cream first, and who invented the waffle cone (and why)?ICE CREAM SUMMER is full of facts about everyone's favorite treat, presented in a breezy way.  There are lots of layers for children to interact with on the level they're ready for.  That is, kids who are learning addition and subtraction might be able to work the math problems on their own.  Others might want to draw their own ice-cream map or read the smaller passages with more historical detail.Ss' pictures not only add to the text, they're also appealing in their own right.  He uses a dreamy and soft palette that echoes the colors of common ice creams, and the art has melty soft edges.  Everything works together thematically.  And who doesn't love ice cream?  Even my lactose intolerant nephew likes the dairy-free frozen treats that he's allowed.ICE CREAM SUMMER is a perfect treat of a children's book.  It has a cute story, great pictures, and invites readers to explore further on their own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R273Z10374OXGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545731615#wasThisHelpful","R273Z10374OXGS","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TROUBLE IS A FRIEND OF MINE is an incredibly fitting title.  When Zoe Webster's parents divorce and she moves to a new town and school, her first new friend is the enigmatic Digby.  Digby gets her into all sorts of trouble, including the sort that convinces her to run back into an exploding building (and that ends up on her permanent record).TROUBLE IS A FRIEND OF MINE is a very over-the-top book.  The personalities are large, the plot is fast paced, and the interweaving tales of sordid crime are told as a slapstick comedy.  It was perfect reading for waiting to get on a plane.  It was quick and funny and didn't take itself seriously, but the subject matter still got under my skin.It helped that I really liked the characters.  Zoe is struggling to define who she is, especially now that she's living farther from her overbearing father and starting to realize that her spacey mother maybe isn't so oblivious.  (Hint to most teenagers: your parents probably are less oblivious than you think.)  Digby is the sort of person who only exists in books, but he works here.  I like how as the truth is uncovered, more and more of his actions make sense.  I also liked his former/current best friend Henry, who gets wrapped up into helping them and getting into trouble with them.  He makes for a nice contrast with Digby as the second male lead.  I thought the supporting cast worked well too, including the mean girl who goes along for the ride during the climax.Zoe and Digby's search for a missing girl throws them into the path of a pervert, local (and not-so-local) drug dealers, rogue cops, a cult, and a flat-out bully.  It also livens up their night at the school dance quite a bit.  Pretty much all the trouble the teens get into is preposterous, but the characterization and neat plotting keep TROUBLE IS A FRIEND OF MINE clicking along.I hope that Stephanie Tromly plans to write more of these three characters, although she does leave them in a good place.  Even if she doesn't, I'm sure her next book will also be a riot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24H5F4LVV6G72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525428402#wasThisHelpful","R24H5F4LVV6G72","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My niece and nephew are as Frozen-obsessed as most children.  This Anna sings a snippet of ""The First Time in Forever.""  The sound quality is pretty good - the song is clear and it isn't too loud.Most of her outfit is molded on; the skirt is removable with elastic at the top.  They own a few other Frozen dolls made in a similar style, so they can swap the skirts.  Her crown and shoes are also removable.  The painted face is cute and the paint on her outfit was well done.The hairstyle is gelled pretty heavily into place.  The doll had a few stray hairs that I snipped and I used a touch of gentle heat to mold her fringe into a better shape.Her arms are permanently molded into the singing position.  It's cute, but not as good for play as moveable joints would be.The singing feature is nice and the main feature for buying this Anna doll.

"I haven't read MY AWESOME/AWFUL POPULARITY PLAN, the first book about Justin by veteran Broadway pianist Seth Rudetsky.  However, I was able to follow THE RISE AND FALL OF A THEATER GEEK just fine without it.  Justin is a rather abrasive narrator.  His mind is a little like a hamster running constantly around a wheel, and he thinks he knows best for everyone.  I still liked him.Justin makes several mistakes at the beginning of THE RISE AND FALL OF A THEATER GEEK.  He pushes his boyfriend Spencer and best friend Becky too hard, and ends up alienating them.  He also lies to the woman who lined up an internship for him to get out of it because he got a better internship working directly for a heartthrob making his Broadway debut.  I found the second particularly naive of Justin, since most people understand you giving up one opportunity for another that fits your goals better.  Lying, however, is less understandable.THE RISE AND FALL OF A THEATER GEEK weaves together Justin's personal growth over his internship in New York with a mystery about why his employer is making such terrible acting decisions and what his agent is up to.  The mystery is pretty obvious, so it's good that Justin's character growth is done with more nuance to balance it.  Although Spencer and Becky aren't seen much in the novel due to the fight, I liked that they're shown to have gone on their own journeys.  I like supporting characters with their own lives.You might try reading a sample of THE RISE AND FALL OF A THEATER GEEK first, because Justin's voice might not work for you.  If it does, this is a fairly cute bildungsroman with some nice details about how a Broadway show comes to be.  It's pretty predictable, but I can see theater kids loving this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCCM9DPQIXS6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0449816729#wasThisHelpful","RCCM9DPQIXS6Y","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dan Cereill had a pretty cushy life, but now his parents are divorced and he's living in his mom in a historically protected house that smells terrible.  Among other things, he just wants to not be a complete loser and to be a good guy (unlike his dad, who he blames for the divorce).I've heard about Fiona Wood through The Bookish Manicurist, who maintains a list of recommended Aussie YA.  I haven't read WILDLIFE yet, but I'm definitely going to check it out based on how much I enjoyed SIX IMPOSSIBLE THINGS.  Dan seems a bit advanced for his age (he's fourteen), but he was still a believable teenage boy.  I liked the way high school, girl, and family problems blended together and that learning to navigate one helped Dan out with others.The supporting cast is also likeable, from Estelle (the girl next door he has a crush on) to his other neighbor's girlfriend who is always available to help out a friend.  I particularly liked Dan's mother, who is struggling to build a business to support her and Dan.  Unfortunately, she went into wedding cakes.  She has the skill, but it isn't the most suitable job for a recent divorcee.  The running gag of her breaking up future marriages goes on long enough to go from funny to not funny, and back around to funny.I liked that Dan isn't instantly forgiven for his mistakes, but has to work to make amends.  I also liked that he understood the things he does wrong in pursuit of his six impossible things.  At the same time, he also does a number of good things in his struggle.  He listens to people, gets involved, and is generally proactive.  I like a protagonist who goes after what they want.SIX IMPOSSIBLE THINGS is a breezy read for the younger YA set.  It's also a nice change of pace from most contemporary YA thanks to the Australian setting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AEDJX7LDVP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316242160#wasThisHelpful","R3AEDJX7LDVP2","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The comparisons to NIGHT FILM and THE SHINING GIRLS drew me in.  Both were creepy literary gems, and if LOVE IS RED was half as good I was sure to love it.  I'm not sure that I do.LOVE IS RED opens with a rape scene, which was not the best first impression.  Half the novel (maybe a little over half) is told through the killer's point of view using the second person.  The second person point of view was an interesting choice of literary technique and I thought it worked well to add a bit of tension to his sections, that such a killer could be watching you.  However, his sections were hard for me to read.  I liked that he focused on his victims' emotions over his bodies, but that aspect was still there.  And unlike THE SHINING GIRLS, I never really felt we got to see the victims as people in their own right.  They remain the archetypes the killer has marked them as.The other narrator is Katherine Emerson, a young woman living with a roommate and her roommate's son.  She's recently met and started dating David, a perfectly nice man, but she's also started sleeping with his best friend Sael after a sexually charged encounter where they didn't realize they had any acquaintances in common.  LOVE IS RED does not hide that one of these men is the killer and that Katherine is his ultimate planned victim.  I thought which was the killer was obvious, which does mean Sophie Jaff was good at characterizing them clearly.  At the same time, it meant the book was jumping through some unnecessary hoops.The fantastic elements of LOVE IS RED are rather quiet at first.  The killer describes emotions in synesthetic ways and believes he is reliving a grand purpose, but it takes awhile for the narrative to start showing that he isn't just delusional.  Ghosts start to show up, and more of the past is revealed (mostly through the device of excerpts from a manuscript between chapters).  I definitely felt like a lot of the worldbuilding was left for future books in the Night Song trilogy.  I had an idea of the concepts that were in play, but not specifics.  I'm unsure what the stakes of the story were, beyond Katherine's life.  If you're going to hint at a battle through the centuries, then I at least need some idea of what will happen if either side wins.I did like that LOVE IS RED wrapped up the serial killer plot and left the romance at a reasonable ending point.  There are a lot of threads left dangling for the next book, but this one can stand alone.  I also liked the way the theme of motherhood became increasingly important through the story.  It is seeded at the beginning, so it doesn't feel unnatural when it takes a larger part in LOVE IS RED.Jaff's writing is often lovely, but it left me dry.  LOVE IS RED approaches feminist themes, the way women are discarded in particular, but never seems to have a coherent point of view to express about them.  The serial killer passages actively turned me off most of the time, and Katherine wasn't a much more compelling narrator.  The first moment between her and Sael is incredibly charged, but their chemistry throughout the book leans to hard on that single interaction to carry it all.  The relationship with David never has a moment half as magnetic.  Her job as a critic might as well never have been mentioned.  Her relationship with Lucas, her roommate's son, is cute.But I kept waiting for Katherine to seize control of her narrative and stop being a victim in waiting and waffling between two not particularly compelling dudes.  I'm not sure that ever quite happened.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSB9QJSM8TVDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062346261#wasThisHelpful","RSB9QJSM8TVDN","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you see the cover, you might think SPELLED is a Cinderella story; however, it is a fractured fairytale version of The Wizard of Oz.  It draws from both the original novel and the movie adaptation, down to Dorthea wearing a pair of ruby and silver heels.  She's a rather spoiled princess who makes an unwise wish that banishes her parents and starts unraveling the magic of her land.  Together with the prince she's been betrothed to against her will and a servant girl, she must defeat the evil witch and restore the land's magic.Oz fans will enjoy seeing familiar situations twisted into something new, particularly when it comes to the ways water might defeat someone.  I did feel that Betsy Schow never came up with something quite as twisted for her telling as L. Frank Baum.  For all their whimsy, the original Oz books were chock-full of the stuff from nightmares.I liked how Dorthea, Kato, and Rexi grew throughout the story.  All three of them rise to the challenges they face (often from the sidelines for the practical Rexi).  I also liked that SPELLED didn't make it all about Dorthea needing to be less spoiled and Kato and Rexi's first impression being right.  Dorthea is definitely spoiled, but she also has good instincts and cares about people.  She's not someone who writes others off as collateral damage.  Nor is she someone who kills easily, even when given reason and power to do so.  It was fun to watch her grow into more of the best person she could be.SPELLED is a fast-paced book with one adventure happening after another.  True to the source, that.  It reaches a mostly satisfying conclusion, until you read the epilogue setting up the next book.  They've still got a long way to go to save the world, and I look forward to seeing how this rag-tag trio does it.SPELLED will appeal to fans of modern fairytale retellings and other modern takes on classic literature like the Splintered series by A.G. Howard.  It's a book with a nice balance of plot, character development, and romance.  Schow's debut young adult novel is a good 'un.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7K320XGW7E6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492608718#wasThisHelpful","R7K320XGW7E6U","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice gift set with three full-size products.The shampoo is my favorite item.  It doesn't clear as much grease as some (I need to use clarifying shampoo at least once a week with it), but it leaves my hair fluffy.  It also has a pleasant minty-ness to it on top of the foresty scent that is the base of all the products' fragrance.  Just be careful not to get it into your eyes.The body wash is average.  The whole ""for men"" thing is obviously a marketing gimmick, but it does have significantly different ingredients than the Dove for women body wash I own.  I like that it is made to stand on its lid.The deodorant does not last for 48 hours as claimed; 24 was as far as I was willing to push it.  It is very strongly fragranced; sort of a cologne/forest/generic men's bath products smell.  Plus, the smell lingers.  You will smell of your deodorant for hours like a teenage boy who doused himself in Axe.

"I couldn't resist reading POWERLESS.  I like Tera Lynn Childs' Greek mythology-inspired series and Tracy Deebs' romance novels as Tracy Wolff.  Plus, novels featuring superheroes are one of my favorite things.  A topic I like by authors I enjoy?  Yep, no way I could resist.I'm glad I didn't.  POWERLESS is a propulsive read that both tells an exciting story and sets up several future plotlines for a series.  It all starts in a lab, where Kenna Swift is working late.  Kenna is powerless, but she's also immune to powers thanks to a serum her mother secretly cooked up.  Hero or villain, it doesn't matter - although Kenna can still be hurt by collateral damage.  That's why she remembers the three villains who invaded the lab looking for a friend, even though one of them thought he wiped her mind.  Kenna knows who the heroes and the villains are, but she can't help thinking that they didn't seem that evil.  So she goes snooping.If you like stories about family secrets, people banding together to do the right thing, and creative uses of chapstick, you'll enjoy POWERLESS.  I liked that there was an interesting mix of relationships in the main group.  There's Kenna, her best friend Rebel, and her ex-boyfriend Jeremy representing the heroes.  Then Draven (who Kenna is attracted to), Dante, and Nitro representing the villains.  There are romantic, sibling, and friend relationships within the group, in addition to some tensions between people who used to be enemies.  This mix means that even though it is a larger ensemble, there's a lot to define each character and how they react to the others.I liked that Childs and Deebs didn't spend too long building up to the heroes-are-the-villains reveal.  (In fact, the prologue basically gives it away.)  It's where the story is obviously heading, so why save it for the climax?  When we get it at the beginning of the book we get to see more of how Kenna reacts.  (To be fair, it is mostly denial at first.)POWERLESS did feel like the beginning of a series.  There's several action scenes, but they're mostly set up for events in future books.  At the same time, I feel like Childs and Deebs still managed to tell a complete story about Kenna and her friends.  I'm definitely curious about how things will play out in the second book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R73NLPEPSA0DC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492616575#wasThisHelpful","R73NLPEPSA0DC","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm not entirely sure Tobin's POV added that much to the story, aside from reminders that they do need to find Abbie/CeCe.  (Okay, his romance with Lexie is cute.)  The main plot of the story is trying to figure out where the Compass and Key are so that Haden and friends can get into the Underworld and kill the Keres, while not letting anyone else get the Key and prompting more undesirable outcomes.  (If that sentence was gibberish, read book one.)I liked the way the romance between Daphne and Haden developed at first in THE ETERNITY KEY.  Haden is working up the courage to say the words, and Daphne is working to prove to Haden that they can be equals (instead of her being the damsel in distress).  And then Daphne rebuffs Haden for a reason that barely made sense.  I sure hope the third book has a better explanation, like magical interference.THE ETERNITY KEY ends with all three narrators in peril.  Bree Despain is a cruel author, torturing her readers like that.  I hope Lerner acquiring titles from Egmont USA means that book three won't be delayed, because I need the conclusion to this trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R98AASI6EAAVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606844679#wasThisHelpful","R98AASI6EAAVS","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First: this game resembles The Game of LIFE Junior far more than it resembles the traditional game.  That's handy because it makes it appropriate for playing with younger children (five or so) who are still really into Despicable Me and the minions, but it was kind of disappointing.  Collecting people in my car is my favorite part of the game and has been since I was a kid.You go along the board, picking up careers and occasionally paychecks.  You use your money to buy bunches of bananas, or steal them from other players.  Periodically you have to spin your piece to choose where to go.  This doesn't work that well; it generally takes several tries to get a good spin (or more for the kids).  Plus the many plastic spinner pieces have to be taken back off to fit the board in the box.  I'm not sure how long the cardboard will hold up if the spinners are put on and removed for frequent play.This is okay if you just want a game to play with your kids because of the simple rules and short play time, but don't pick it up expecting the traditional Life gameplay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REV24XKS2ACKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQQTXP8#wasThisHelpful","REV24XKS2ACKF","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gameplay on this board is similar to the original Trouble.  There is an extra die in the POP-O-MATIC bubble that can grant a player Siren Bob, who keeps their minions safe.While the play is the same, the quality isn't.  The board is just cardboard and you move your pieces like a regular game.  With regular Trouble, they are pegs that you can pop along plastic holes in the board.  I think the board will last, but it isn't as fun as normal Trouble.  The main problem is the bubble - it doesn't pop as well as other versions I've owned.  You've really got to depress it with force.If you enjoy playing Trouble and really like Despicable Me, you can pick up this board.  But if you just want the game, I'd grab the traditional version for the higher quality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPM3Q9C07790L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQQTXY4#wasThisHelpful","RPM3Q9C07790L","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kenneth Oppel and Jon Klassen are both titans of children's literature.  Their first collaboration is a creepy confection sure to delight fans of CORALINE.  I hate to make the same comparison as the marketing, but this is one of those cases where it is true.Steve's baby brother is sick.  It is a congenital problem, and he needs surgery, and he might not ever be completely normal.  That's when Steve first dreams about the angels, the wasps, who offer to help.  At first it seems like his dreams might just be a sensitive boy dealing with a tough time, experiencing his family's stress the only way he can.  But the dreams are getting more sinister, and Steve is starting to suspect that he shouldn't have agreed to let the wasp queen help.  Of course, no adults will believe him that they need to protect the baby from the wasps.Klassen's art is a terrific accompaniment to the story.  In black and white his distinctive style looks quite sinister.  It's startling white shapes on black backgrounds and shadows on shadows.  Although the illustrations look quite simple, each enhances the mood of the text.Oppel's writing is in fine form.  The text is rather large on the page, so THE NEST is even shorter than it seems.  The words are as deceptively simple as the illustrations.  Even a slower reader probably won't take to long to get through THE NEST, excepting for breaks to slow the creepy-crawlies.  As short as the story is, it's the kind that burrows into you and makes you look at the world around you in a different way, as everyday things become sinister.  It's also a well done portrait of childhood anxieties, both normal kid fears and trying to understand the fears of your parents which you can sense even when they try to hide them.I expect this scary story will become a new children's classic.  If it doesn't, that's a true shame.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWYO15OI7K004/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148143232X#wasThisHelpful","RWYO15OI7K004","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marie Rutkoski knows how to keep you on your toes.  THE WINNER'S CRIME is a tale of entwining intrigues that ends in a cliffhanger that will make you wish you had THE WINNER'S KISS on hand.  (People reading this review at least a year in the future, I envy you for your ability to do just that.)Kestrel is promised to marry Prince Verex and become the next empress, even though she loves Arin.  Arin is now the governor of Herran, but that doesn't mean his country is instantly set back to rights.  His country has been looted and stripped of much of his resources, yet they must still tithe the emperor.  Arin is reeling from the knowledge that Kestrel betrayed him and never loved him, whereas Kestrel is reeling from all she gave up is order to keep everyone she loved alive.I normally don't like it when miscommunication propels the plot of a novel, particularly one with romantic elements, but it works here.  Rutkoski has created a situation where it isn't safe for the characters to just say the truth.  There are spies everywhere, and one wrong word will get both Arin and Kestrel killed (and more people along with them).  I also think it worked for me because they need some time where neither of them are the other's slave.I enjoyed that the romance took a backseat to the politics.  The court is complicated, and Herran isn't the only source of conflict.  The country to the east is still fighting back, unconquered.  Their biggest weakness is the queen's sister, a hostage at the capital.  I cannot wait to see how that plot develops further in THE WINNER'S KISS.Now, THE WINNER'S CRIME is a second book.  There's lots of establishing a new status quo and setting up all the exciting things to happen in the final book of the trilogy.  But it still works on its own, particularly a wrenching confrontation towards the middle of the book.  It's an exciting book to read and a rough one, because the characters keep making mistakes that are so them.  I can only hope that they get it right by the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GCV6W1KUN6F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374384703#wasThisHelpful","R3GCV6W1KUN6F8","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LOVE AND MISS COMMUNICATION looked super cute.  It's the story of Evie Rosen, who gets fired for sending too many personal emails and discovers that her commitment-phobe ex got married six months after their breakup on Facebook, and decides to stay off the Internet for a year.  I spent the first half of the book wanting to shake Evie out of her self-absorbed funk.I wasn't surprised by the zeal she brings to her decision to leave the Internet behind; there's nothing like the converted to disdain they were before.  I did think her characterization needed work.  Debut author Elyssa Friedland describes her as always having her Blackberry in her hand and constantly Facebook stalking people.  Yet, for instance, she's surprised when one of her stepsisters has already made friends at the college she's going to in the fall through Facebook.  It's not like she'd never used the Internet.Then there's the way she is with her family and friends.  She's weirdly contemptuous of her stepsisters and has inappropriate boundaries with a student at her new job.  For talk of using actual phone calls to get closer to people, she never reaches out to her friends but waits for them to reach out to her.  However, LOVE AND MISS COMMUNICATION did start clicking into place for me once Evie's mother snaps at her that everyone tries to matchmake for her because she's so desperately and obviously unhappy being single.  The characters finally get tired of Evie and start talking to her and helping her realize that she needs to change her attitude.Thus, the second half did work better for me.  Evie does have a journey to go on and a coherent character arc.  There is room in the world for grating characters.  And throughout the book I thought the romance worked well.  Now, it shows how much Evie idolizes marriage and how bad she is at communication that she never thinks to just ask the guy if she's divorced, but I did like that she holds back from actually making a move until she knows he isn't attached.  I also just thought their flirting was cute.  I also liked the parts about Evie's ex, Jack.  She's still reeling from the bad breakup, and Friedman captures the way you never really forget the people you loved.I loved the premise of LOVE AND MISS COMMUNICATION.  I feel like it could've been explored more to its full potential with a character who was interested in actually connecting with people instead of being content to just complain about another missed evite.  The romance was cute and I liked Evie's grandmother and mother.  I also enjoyed every time someone pointed out to Evie how self-absorbed she was.  It made for an uneven reading experience, but not a wasted one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RU9P19WC988H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062379844#wasThisHelpful","R2RU9P19WC988H","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw the cover of FEET, GO TO SLEEP, I knew my niece would enjoy the book.  The little girl wearing glasses and doing a headstand would definitely appeal to her.  (My niece is currently working on her aerial and generally terrifying any adult in her vicinity.)  It's also aimed right at my nephew's age group.Barbara Bottner's text walks that little girl, Fiona, through going to sleep, body part by body part.  Maggie Smith's images work well with the text.  The book has a dual-image layout, where Fiona going to sleep is in a small box and the bigger image shows just how she used that body part on her seaside vacation.  The text and illustrations work very well together.One touch I particularly loved is that Fiona's cousins (who she chases with her legs) are black.  It's a small detail that isn't commented on, but is appreciated.  Children are great at picking over the details in picture books through multiple readings.I'm sure any adult who reads kids to sleep is used to the cry of ""One more book!""  FEET, GO TO SLEEP makes for a good finish to bedtime reading.  Fiona's method of going to sleep, bit by bit, is very helpful and soothing.  (The details about how Fiona gets up to mischief during the day do keep the book from being a snore.)  FEET, GO TO SLEEP is a good nighttime read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RGOFMGLAVQDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0449813258#wasThisHelpful","R1RGOFMGLAVQDN","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this edition of Trivial Pursuit.  It has 100 sets of questions for adults and 100 sets of questions for kids.  A first grader might not be the best with the questions, but can at least play.  Teens can use the adult questions too.  I think the questions are slightly easier than the normal version, but that might be because I'm used to playing my grandparent's version from the early 80s.The board is also simplified to help the game be kid-friendly and go faster.  You can play a round in a night easily as each round takes less than thirty minutes on average.I think it is a great compromise for families playing with a wide age-range represented.  The adults aren't stuck playing a board game that's way too easy and the kids aren't stuck playing one that's way too hard.  If I just had a group of adult friends I was playing with, I would stick to the original.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVOGK8731MLJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQQTXNK#wasThisHelpful","RVOGK8731MLJC","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had no clue what color this polish would be, since it looks different in every ad.  I would say that this is a silver with a gold shift foil polish.

"Naomi Novik has created a lovely fantasy rooted in a strong female friendship.  UPROOTED feels both traditional and fresh, with roots in folklore but a strong perspective of its own.  Agnieszka is a teenage girl in a village where one girl is taken by the Dragon once every ten years.  The girls are released, but always go on to leave the village.  To her surprise, Agnieszka is chosen instead of her lovely best friend Kasia.  (By the way, Agnieszka is the Polish version of Agnes, if you're confused about how to say it.)Agnieszka's early days with the Dragon are miserable: he is rude and belittling.  But she soon discovers that she was picked because she has magic, and the Dragon must train her.  Unfortunately, Agnieszka is a lackadaisical student.  The Dragon is fastidious and fussy, and clashes strongly with Agnieszka's casual-to-slovenly manner.  Yet when Agnieszka's village and Kasia turn out to be in grave danger, she suddenly has a reason to pay attention to her magic and develop her gift.UPROOTED is wonderfully creepy.  The antagonist is the Wood, a strange place that has been there as long as anyone can remember.  It is trying to overtake human settlements; being corrupted by the Wood is a horrible fate.  It requires constant vigilance by the strongest magicians to keep the Wood at bay.  It is a canny force indeed.  The horror of the wood contrasts with the warmth of Agnieszka's personality.Magicians are long lived, and few of the ones living have many ties to other people left.  Agnieszka still cares, still has the optimism that she can save people and make a lasting difference.  She especially has her tie to Kasia, the childhood friend she loved and envied so long.  I love how complicated their relationship is.  Novik doesn't make it all sweet.  She develops the ways the girls resent each other, the secret frictions that happen between even the best of friends.I don't have much to say about the romance between Agnieszka and the Dragon, which seems a rather obligatory hook up between the hero and heroine.  (It left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, how awful he was to her in the beginning.  I was also disappointed he wasn't actually a dragon.)  I will say that I love how much relationships between women propel the plot.  UPROOTED is a great novel for female heroes and villains.If you enjoy fantasy novels with a fairytale feel and a genuinely scary adversary, then read UPROOTED.  It is a novel sure to delight fans of Robin McKinley and Patricia C. Wrede.  While an adult novel, it has a lot of young adult appeal too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NFFKTTPS158/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804179034#wasThisHelpful","R6NFFKTTPS158","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know Jonathan Maberry's Rot and Ruin series is hugely popular, and I might've read the first book of the Nightsiders series for that alone.  But I was truly drawn in by the illustrated cover.  I love how detailed it is.  The swampy background, Milo throwing a stone, Evangelyne using magic, and the shadow of a menacing claw - all pretty accurate to the book contents.  (I cared so much about that sort of thing when I was in the proper age range.)I do thing THE ORPHAN ARMY starts slow for a book aimed at the middle grade market.  There is lots to set up: this Earth is being attack by Bugs and the humans are losing.  Even the children are fighting in the war.  (This is the justification to make eleven-year-old Milo part of the action, which is likely only believable to younger readers.)  Milo has had strange dreams all his life, but his waking days get even weirder when he runs into a wolf and a girl while on patrol.  However, it takes almost a hundred pages to get to the real action.  The pace is helped along by the short chapters.THE ORPHAN ARMY combines science fiction (the attacking aliens) with fantasy (the Nightsiders).  As Milo finds out, many of the creatures humans tell stories about are real, and they're coming out of hiding to help fight the Bugs.  Maberry knows how to create a high-stakes situation.  Milo doesn't feel like he's a hero, but his dreams have been preparing him for this.  He not only has to fight the Bugs, but also convince the Nightsiders that humans are worth working with and saving.THE ORPHAN ARMY ends with a few tantalizing hints about what is to come.  I'm sure those who enjoy the book will be eager to pick up the second volume in the Nightsiders series.  I don't think this one is for me.  It's very middle grade, with little crossover interest for adult readers.  It is written on a simple level, and I just found the age of the protagonist too unbelievable.  I'm getting old.  I do have some younger relatives I think will love it.  Scifi/fantasy with lots of action and no romance is right up their alley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JT8IMEOCXPOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481415751#wasThisHelpful","R1JT8IMEOCXPOB","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This pack comes with six scents - three from the Duru Gourmet line and three from the Natural line.  It's a good way to figure out which scent you like best or to keep switching things up so you don't get tired of the scent.  None of the scents are overpowering, and some are extremely subtle.  The Gourmet line scents do smell slightly more artificial, but I love the Mango Ice Cream scent.  It has the sharp and tangy sweet smell of real mango.  (Do note that natural applies to the scent used, and is not an organic or all-natural claim.)This soap does a good job in the kitchen, both removing grease and spicy pepper oils from hands without issue.

"Set in a near-future version of the Bronx, MORE HAPPY THAN NOT starts out like a contemporary coming-of-age tale.  Aaron Soto is even poorer than most of the other kids living in the projects, but he's happy.  He loves his girlfriend Genevieve and his great new friend Thomas.  But when he starts to think that he likes Thomas as more than a friend, things get complicated.So what makes this a near-future story?  The Leteo Institute.  The Leteo procedure can remove those memories that have been plaguing you.  It's mentioned so frequently throughout the first half that you just know someone is going to get one.  It made me want to bite my nails, wondering what would happen to drive Aaron to get the procedure.  And then it came, and MORE HAPPY THAN NOT shifted.I liked how debut author Adam Silvera sprinkled hints about what was to come throughout the first half of the book.  There are glimpses of people who seem off, for instance.  He sets up what is to come very well.  I also liked that he doesn't rely on one big twist, especially since many readers will probably sense what is coming.  The second half of MORE HAPPY THAN NOT unfolds in increasingly heartbreaking ways.I felt immersed in this novel.  For all that Silvera resists setting MORE HAPPY THAN NOT at a specific time, the setting is very grounded.  You get a great sense of the life Aaron and his sort of friends lead.  Even though he doesn't quite fit in, he's still got a real sense of community with them.  (Okay, one touch I was bothered by: the mention of a new Avengers movie in December.  Those are summer blockbusters!)  I also liked the reality of the ways they hang out, going to comic shops, relaxing on the roof, playing made up games just outside the building.  The sci-fi premise makes the story go, but it is strongly grounded in realism.  This helps strike a good balance between the fantastical and the personal difficulties Aaron faces in his life.MORE HAPPY THAN NOT is a striking debut.  The tech is similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but the questions the story asks are different.  Silvera ripped out my heart and stomped on it, yet I am already ready for his next book.  If he's this good now, what will he write next?","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SYVJ908FWGNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616955600#wasThisHelpful","R2SYVJ908FWGNV","AX9C10JD538D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX9C10JD538D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is clearly going to be a very divisive movie. There are some people who seem to be utterly amazed by this film, and others who will claim they fell asleep. Hearing both of those statements already, I have to wonder if we watched the same movie? I found it very enjoyable and original. The concept is pretty brilliant in it's simplicity. Compared to many modern horror movies, it definitely has throwback qualities and spends more time on suspense than violence and gore. The acting is good. The setting is perfect. The soundtrack is great. It's nice to see kids in a horror movie that don't live in mini mansions on perfectly manicured streets. That bit of reality itself is refreshing. That being said, the film is flawed. It's difficult to elaborate on that without giving spoilers, so instead I'll just say the movie's biggest flaw....the hype. This is being WAY over hyped. Yes, it's creepy, it's somewhat original, and it's a fun movie. However, it's not a masterpiece. Not even close. Seeing reviews proclaiming it ""the scariest movie of 2015"" when it's only March....well, what is that about? ""The best horror film of the decade."" Hardly. It's one of the better ones, for sure, but if it's the best....we can go ahead and close the door on the genre, I'd say. I think this a movie that *most* horror fans will at least enjoy, but proceed with caution, because the hype this movie is getting is going to elicit some serious backlash before long. It's just not the all out scare-fest that the marketing machine is proclaiming. Horror films that are anything better than mediocre seem to be lavished with praise these days (the same thing just happened with ""The Babadook""), which is a pretty sad indication of where horror is at these days. That being said, ""It follows"" is a good movie, but it's not half as scary or groundbreaking as the quote covered posters would lead you to believe. It might have been better off being a sleeper hit, because this hype is it's ultimate downfall. A lot of people are going to be underwhelmed, I know I was, and that's unfair to a movie that deserves to be seen without expectations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R167QQM4Q917CG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAVNN5W#wasThisHelpful","R167QQM4Q917CG","A2HC5RRZ399BSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HC5RRZ399BSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used many of the hair fiber brands, and I have to say, I like this one the least. I got the medium brown, which seemed to take on a reddish color when I applied it to my hair. It still worked, but because the fibers are smaller and more powder-like in this brand, I think I actually ended up using more. When trying to even it out by patting my hair, it would all just fly away. This isn't something that I've experienced with some of the other brands.

"I guess it's safe to say that the Mario Party series as we knew it...is over. After a pretty lame Mario Party 8 and the disastrous Mario Party 9, both for Wii, the first game in the series for Wii U is no better. This just isn't the Mario Party that we grew up playing with friends and having such a great time. I remember playing Mario Party 6 for hours and stll not wanting to stop. This is a dumbed down, childish, and flat out BORING replacement for those earlier games. Bowser Mode: The biggest addition is Bowser mode, where one player plays against up to another 4. While the mode isn't a total loss, there are no normal mini games, just Bowser party games...and there are only 10. So it does get repetitive. Also, the only person having any new experience with the game is the person playing as Bowser! Good luck giving all your friends a chance at the gamepad, everyone will play once and be uninterested afterwards. It's just not that fun.  Much like the regular party mode, mini games are often too infrequent. You also cannot play Bowser mode on every board, only select boards. Amiibo Mode: A total waste of time and cash grab for Nintendo. This mode is supposed to be modeled after the old Mario Parties...except is has little to do with any of them other than the rules. The boards are small, perfectly square, and completely boring. There is nothing interesting about this mode and it definitely gives you the sense that it only serves the purpose of getting more people to purchase Amiibos, which have yet to prove any real significance for the Wii U. But, who is surprised? Nintendo has become the king of gimmicks, flashy advertising, and unbelievably poor delivery. Mario Party Mode: This is basically an HD version of Mario Party 9. The boards are a little more interesting and interactive...but not enough to even really acknowledge it and the majority of the themes are the same that have been used over and over again. MIni games are infrequent, yet again, but have hardly any effect anyway. The boss battles are overly simplified, and have little impact on anything, since the entire game is nearly 100% luck based from the second it starts. Then there is the car. The bloody car.

People complained about Mario Party 9  and it's terrible mechanics, including all players moving together....so Nintendo has repaid us by making the exact same game over again!

I was hoping Nintendo would redeem themselves on their new console from the lousy Wii releases of the series. I was so wrong. This is every mistake, repackage in pretty HD paper. It's not worth it.

"Kenneth Branagh's latest adaptation of the classic fairy tale is a sweeping, lavish and beautiful production. Unlike so many of the fairy tale themed movies of the last few years, this version of ""Cinderella"" is a straightforward, traditional retelling. It takes itself seriously. It's also a breath of fresh air for that very reason. Instead of fluffing the story with unnecessary forced plot lines,complicated back stories, villians that are are just misunderstood (boring)... Branagh's ""Cinderella"" is the story everyone knows, and it is told exceptionally well. This is a superb film for families and people of all ages. I can't imagine any boy, girl, man or woman NOT finding something enchanting about it.  Lily James is perfect as Cinderella, bringing a sweetness and innocence to the character that is at once sympathetic, and yet always bold and determined. Cate Blanchett is equally wonderful as Lady Tremaine, every bit as mean and vile as a Disney villain should be, while clearly hiding some pain of her own . I don't even know where to begin with the production and costume design...it is breathtaking. Someone in some department will likely be taking home an Oscar next year. The soundtrack by Patrick Doyle is very beautiful, as well. It is difficult not to get at least a few butterflies when the music swells and Cinderella's dress turns to a ravishing gown. I have to say, I didn't expect this to be as good as it is. I really didn't. I've found most of Disney's work these last few years to be extremely underwhelming (including Frozen and Into the Woods). This changes everything! I think it's important to note that the film never gives the impression that Cinderella just needed a prince to be happy. It's made clear that what she needed was to be allowed to be herself. I was very happy to see that. While nothing can ever replace Disney's original animated film, this is far and away the best live action version I've ever seen. See it on the big screen if you can. It is so worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JKH5YQ37HGJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UI5CTE2#wasThisHelpful","R2JKH5YQ37HGJJ","A2HC5RRZ399BSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HC5RRZ399BSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm serious. The acting is terrible, the writing is terrible, the directing is terrible and the only thing even remotely scary is that someone put up money for this. This is the kinda movie you watch with friends on a late night to laugh and have a good time.  You really need to see it for yourself, because there just are not adjectives to describe it.

"I was pretty excited to see this one. The trailer looked amazing. Unfortunately, I finished it feeling underwhelmed and slightly disappointed. I had never seen any of the shorts on youtube before, so this was all new to me. Out of the 3 short films in this, I really only enjoyed the last one. The others are overly simplistic and predictable. The frame story that showcases the other three is decent, but not at all original. One of the stories in the collection does not even take place on Halloween, and features someone so obviously in an Alien suit it comes off comical. I'll watch it again, but I don't think this movie is going to catch on as a Halloween staple. Not at all. I wouldn't write off the director, hopefully he can churn out a few more films as fun and creepy as ""Terrifier"". I wanted to like this as much as anyone, but the fact is...it's just not that good.

"I've been reading this story since I was in 5th grade... 16 years ago. Ive, bought this book in several different incarnations, usually with a collection of other shorts I wasn't really interested in. I'm glad to just have the story itself on kindle. It's a very touching, funny, and well written coming-of-age story. I used it for an oral interpretation class when I was in College, and everyone loved the sound of it. I think I related so much to the story because I grew up in an area much like the one in the story. I've also always been interested in Diner's, a dying piece of Americana. This story is as warm and inviting as any great diner should be. It teaches an important lesson as well, excitement and opportunity is all around you, but you have to look or you won't see it.

I just didn't think the inserted ""modern"" jokes were that funny, nor were their caricatures good enough to carry the whole movie. I just didn't see much humor in this.

"Plot: Horror fans at a convention are invited to an ""exclusive"" party at a farmhouse. When they wake up after, they find themselves trapped in the movie ""Night of the living dead"". Each playing parts from the original film.  I honestly think this could be one of the best ideas for a horror movie in years. Instead of remakes or attempts to reinvent, this movie simply puts ""real"" world characters into a famous film from the past. Might be the best scenario to answer the question of ""what would you do?"" if you were suddenly living in a movie you knew very well. The problem is that even though the film it's using for inspiration was made for next to nothing, this great idea could have used some more money and bigger talent all around. If this brilliantly simple idea had been in the hands of some experienced people...wow. But...it's not. Seeing a great idea turn out like this is a shame. There are plenty of problems all around. Everyone remembers the farmhouse in NOLD crawling with zombies. Not here. There are literally a handful, like 5, who spend all their time walking the lawn and making no effort to break into the house. Remember when the zombies in NOTLD just stood outside and did nothing? Me either.What exactly is scary about that? The writing all around tends to lack. The theme doesn't carry far enough. It starts to seem like a side note, while the characters walk around a lot and do boring tasks that have nothing to do with the original film (though the locations are good). Whats the point!? This is explained somewhat in the ""twist"" ( i guess you can call it that) but really, its just a huge letdown that we've seen before. Also, the acting is...well...poor. The actors have no sense of urgency, like the entire situation doesn't even phase them...and forget character development. Good thing we know who they represent from the original film because none of them have any personality. Sometimes people who can't pretend to be scared, end up in a horror movie. This would be a good example of that. The movie is just plain boring at times. I think it's worth a look for NOTLD fans, but I was disappointed. I don't think everything needs a big budget to succeed. Not at all. But I kept wondering what could be done with some more creativity and the budget of just one episode of ""The Walking Dead"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21GPJXUOBQQTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADRYEOI#wasThisHelpful","R21GPJXUOBQQTV","A2HC5RRZ399BSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HC5RRZ399BSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""We wouldn't know normal if it fell on us.""  ""October Country"" is the story of family, and how after one generation loses its way, it becomes difficult for the future ones to return. The subjects of the documentary are the Moshers, a working class family living in the Mohawk Valley of central New York. The family is headed by Don, a retired Policeman and veteran, and his wife Dottie. In the film, they reflect on the choices made by their children and grandchildren, which have spun the family into a depressing repetition of failed marriages, abusive relationships, teen pregnancy, poverty, and substance abuse.  Don, who is deeply scarred by his time in Vietnam and the gulf war, is emotionally distant and mentally defeated. His wife, Dottie, does her best to hold her family together, while trying to come to terms with the choices they've made. The town itself reflects the crumbling relationships of the family, with only one plant employing most of the population, and Walmart being the only place to shop. It's an area as depressing as the Mosher's story.  ""October Country"" addresses the question, When you are hurt or disappointed by those you love, what is left? Can a cycle of bad choices be broken? And when should you stop trying to fix other people? There is no real resolution to these questions in the film. It seems that all you are really left with is the fact that despite pain, people continue whether they want to or not. Ghosts of the past follow you, and sometimes the future doesn't look so bright either. While watching a year with the Mosher family, one can't help but think there are thousands of other American families experiencing the same thing. There is a light in the tunnel however, in the form of Desiree, the Mosher's spunky granddaughter, who seems to recognize the mistakes of her mother and sister, as well as the hopelessness of the area.  This is a difficult film to describe, because its beauty lies in it simplicity. There is a story there, but the story is somehow less significant than the result. Change is what is important. I don't know how this wonderfully filmed documentary has fallen under the radar. I found it completely engrossing and honest. I really love documentaries and I think this one of the best I've seen in years. It's as if someone just turned the camera on and caught a portrait American lives that some people would rather just forget. A lot of families have problems that last through generations, and there is a root to every problem. However, it's not always on the surface and easy to dissect. This movie is an honest attempt to examine a family in decline from all angles. You just have to see it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YGOW81SZFDI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QM5Y04#wasThisHelpful","R1YGOW81SZFDI3","A2HC5RRZ399BSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HC5RRZ399BSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As an American, and Stephen Fry fan, I was intrigued to find out what this series would be like. I was not disappointed. It is one of the most fascinating, beautiful, and heartwarming trips across America that I've ever seen. Fry travels to every state in the Union (some seem to get the shaft) from one adventure to the next. I enjoyed very much that for the most part, he avoids major cities. These places have been covered so many times. Instead, he seems to focus on whatever staple each state is known for. Most Americans wouldn't be surprised by his choices, but for others it may be a learning experience of America's various cultures. In a lot of ways, Each state really is like its own country. There is a Sense of unfairness with the time spent in each state. Some he merely drives through, which leaves you feeling underwhelmed. I suppose it wouldn't be a problem, but some of the states that receive the most attention, are rather unworthy of it. His visit to Las Vegas, for example, was strangely boring and much too long. I have to take a star off for that, because much of the series is so good, being thrown a dud episode is depressing. I've already viewed this series twice, and can't wait to jump in again. What a refreshing and fun vacation, with a wonderful host, that you can take right in your living room. I wish the series would return and give more time to the landscapes and cultures of America.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHNE7MFD7O2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KV3E40#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHNE7MFD7O2Q","A2HC5RRZ399BSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HC5RRZ399BSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like the concept of a monocular with a 52mm objective because of its potential for use in low light conditions, and because of its smaller size for backpacking or motorcycle travel. With its simpler construction and protective rubber coating, a monocular should be more rugged in the field. However, the optics of this unit are subpar. Compared with a pair of Nikon 7x25 compact binoculars, and a pair of low-end 8x40 traditional prism binoculars:- Image contrast is low- Only the inner 1/3 of the image is in focus; sharpness falls off sharply toward the perimeter of the visual field- Barrel distortion and chromatic aberration worsen toward the perimeter of the visual fieldFocusing is somewhat confusing: The lower ring of the monocular is used to estimate distance and get a coarse focus, while the eyepiece is used to achieve final focus  which applies only to the center 1/3 of the image.Disclaimer: This product was provided at no cost for a fair and honest review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PQBLY13N48XJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z2LQVZA#wasThisHelpful","R2PQBLY13N48XJ","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a student of user interface design for decades. There are so many horrible products, both hardware and software, but I think that design guru Don Norman ( http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654 ) would approve of the design of this phone. The CapTel phone user interface is brilliant, so simple that, as the old GEICO ads used to say, a caveman could use it. If you can see, you can use this phone. Big, well defined buttons, lighted for the number pad, make it very easy to use, and the screen prompts everything that needs to be done.The caption display shows not only current conversation, but also does voice to text translation for voicemail messages, and while the nature of voice to text is that the translation is never perfect, it's good enough, and generally does extremely well with telephone numbers, which are usually the most important information when making booking. It is good enough that you don't even need to listen to the headset. My mother used to replay the same message over and over and over to get the details; with the screen, all the necessary information is displayed. It's hard to describe what a tremendous improvement this makes.At age 94, my mother still runs a B&B in a 19th century building, but her hearing is not good, which is a terrible handicap when trying to handle calls for reservations. With her old phone, she would become frustrated, and just slam the phone down in anger. She is not only not technically inclined, she is adamantly and vocally anti-technology. Even she admits it's a nice phone.

"Probiotics like vitamins and supplements in general, are one of those gray areas, with many claims, but ambiguous evidence as to their efficacy. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that are good for your health, especially your digestive system. In general, probiotic supplements are thought to be safe, although mild side effects might include upset stomach, diarrhea, gas, and bloating, and they may also trigger allergic reactions. I decided to give them a try a few months ago, and I have experienced no negative side effects, possibly some positive effects on digestion. Medline and WebMD both indicate some potential benefits from probiotics, especially for people with IBS, or who are recovering from an infection that required taking antibiotics, which can kill off beneficial flora in the gut.General advice is to consult your doctor before you start taking a supplement, and stop taking probiotics and talk to your doctor if you experience problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GCPWXYZU59ST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVKARXS#wasThisHelpful","R1GCPWXYZU59ST","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Controls buttons are in a small module on the cord for the right phone, and are easily distinguishable by touch: a ""multifunction button on one side, and two buttons to change volume or tracks on the other side. When not in use, or if you want to talk to someone, a magnet allows the headphones to be joined and worn as a necklace.

"Typically larger laptops run hotter and benefit more from supplementary cooling; cooling pads are awkward to carry, but this snap-on cooling fan is both small and effective.

"At 4"" x 2.75"" x 1.1"" this is about as small a package as you can imagine for 6 charging ports. Unlike most small chargers, every port is rated for 2.4 Amps, something that I cannot measure, but confirmed by testing. Keep in mind that a USB device and charger negotiate the maximum amount of power that can be transferred, usually well below 4 Amps. For example, a 2012 Nexus 7 that was 50% discharged (4325 mAh battery) took approximately 2 hours to reach 100%, about the same time as with a dedicated 2.5 Amp USB charger. I don't have the patience to test charging 6 USB devices at once, but see no reason to doubt the manufacturer's claim, although the charger might heat up somewhat if all 6 ports were used to charge multiple devices simultaneously.The power cord is detachable, so it packs easily, and won't suffer an insulation break, as can occur with many similar devices that have non-detachable power cords. My wife and I will be leaving on a trip in a few days, with the usual 21st century assortment of rechargeable devices: 2 tablets, 2 phones, and 2 pairs of USB headphones, but we will need to pack only a single charger.Disclaimer: This device was provided by the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and balanced review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BKRDGZC3Y41J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014W1H1A4#wasThisHelpful","R2BKRDGZC3Y41J","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have a lithium iron battery in a vehicle that isn't used daily (such as a motorcycle), and want it to perform and last as long as it should, it needs to be kept on a charger  preferably a purpose designed charger, not one designed to meet the needs of a lead acid battery. A bad trickle charger nearly killed my Battery Tender lithium iron battery. With this charger, I have reasonable confidence that it's being charged properly, and that the battery will last the 5 years promised by the manufacturer.  The normal charging cycle is:Solid red LED = Charging from ~80%Blinking green = Final charge to fullSolid green LED = ChargedAmber/Green alternating:  ""Recovery mode"" There may be a problem with the battery, but this can be a false alarm. Unplug the charger for 10 seconds. If the amber/green alternating pattern doesn't go away, contact Deltran customer service about a possible battery issue.Note that this is NOT the same as the Battery Tender Junior, which is designed for lead acid batteries.

"This is a basic collapsible lantern, with an opaque black plastic telescoping case. Pull to turn on, push to turn off; it's so simple that a 2-year old can use it, which makes it very useful for emergencies such as power outages  no fumbling in the dark to find a switch.There are many similar collapsible lanterns available on Amazon, in different colors, with nothing much to distinguish one from another other than price and the lighting element. This one has a vertical array of 3 panels, each with 10 LEDs; others have the LEDs behind a diffuser, with a reflector to further radiate light. I have a slight preference for the more indirect design, which produces less glare. Brightness is controlled by opening/closing the gap between the two halves of the case, but this doesn't affect battery life, as the lantern is either on or off  nothing in between. Expect ~8 hours at full brightness, after which it will continue to shine at a reduced output for a much longer time.At $9.99, it's hard to beat, and if you don't need the added features of more expensive lanterns, don't spend the extra money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5M66KCSY5X3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129GYC5Q#wasThisHelpful","R5M66KCSY5X3R","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Quilted cotton and Nomex gloves and mitts are not the best around hot liquids, which can soak into the cloth, and leave stains that can be difficult to wash out. CLoth gloves are also prone to developing holes and snags with use. Silicone rubber offers a different approach, completely waterproof, and easily cleaned.These gloves are large enough to fit a man's hand and, considering that the main layer is only ~1/16"" thick, they insulate surprisingly well, mainly because of the heart-shaped raised dots, which add another 1/16"" inch, while allowing air to flow through the gaps.

"BA-700 ReviewIn the box is the receiver, which has a Y cord, with USB type-A connector for power, and a 3.5mm jack for output, a circular base plate with adhesive, and a car charger with 2 USB type-A ports  handy if you also have a GPS, as both devices can be powered, or you can charge a phone or tablet. The base is cleverly designed, with a magnetic attachment, and two small notches around the perimeter, which mate with the receiver, preventing it from rotating, or moving in any direction. For this application, where road bumps and such may prevent a steady hand, this is a nice design touch.The round knob controller is unmarked, but intuitive: * Push = On/Off * Jog left = Rewind to beginning of current track * Hold left = Volume down * Jog right = Advance to next track * Hold right = Volume up. A beep indicates maximum volume* A blue light around the perimeter blinks in pairing mode, solid when connected.Pairing is automatic. Not tested, but this receiver can connect to 2 devices, so it should be possible to switch from, say a tablet for listening to music and a phone for calls, or a passenger could use a phone without distracting the driver. Sound output, even at highest volume level, is modest, and the volume on your car's sound system may need to be cranked up higher than usual.+++Pros+++Compact+ Easy and secure to mount, attach and detach+ Intuitive controls don't require taking eye off the road to operate+ Included car charger with 2 USB type-A ports---Cons---- User manual is printed in nearly microscopic type, requiring a magnifying glass to read [I have asked the vendor to make the manual available online in PDF format]- Modest sound output, may require cranking up volume on car audioBottom Line: Because of the control knob, this is the best BT receiver I have seen for use in an automobile  no distractions!Disclaimer: Product provided in exchange for an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12917FJBK7NKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFIUZN4#wasThisHelpful","R12917FJBK7NKJ","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's difficult to get 5 stars out of me for a review, but I can find almost nothing to fault about this little lantern. It comes with a nice protective case, the usual micro-USB charging cable, and 2 orange plastic carabiners. A folding triangular carabiner in the base can be used as a sidestand, or to hang it from a support, and a magnetic base allows it to stick to a steel surface for use as a light source in tight quarters, such as working on a car or motorcycle. The illustrated instructions are in a readable size, although operation is so self-evident they are hardly necessary. Build quality and heft (due to the 3300 mAh Li Ion battery) feel very solid; there are a lot of shoddy products in this category, but this isn't one of them.Aside from the compact shape, I appreciated the blue LED charge indicator on the bottom of the lantern, the relatively large battery capacity, and the 3 light levels (plus flash). The lowest light level is claimed to provide 110 hours, which should be adequate for anything but hiking the Appalachian Trail. Unlike many devices with covers for USB ports, the Type-A, and micro-USB port covers are easy to access  it's a small detail, but a cover that is nearly impossible to pry loose can drive people crazy  especially in the dark. Another small detail is the magnetic base, which makes it usable as a spot light source while working on a car or motorcycle. The next time I take a long motorcycle trip, this is going in my luggage.Observed performance:- Charging time (0% > 100%) : 7 hours @ 1 Amp; ~4 hours @ 2.5 Amp (claimed 4:30)- High : 7 hours (claimed 8)- Medium : 10:15 (claimed 12)- Low : Claimed 110 hours, didn't have patience to test- Charge 2012 Nexus 7 tablet (4325 mAh battery) 50% > 100% : 3:15, which suggests >1 Amp, a good performanceDISCLAIMER: This product was provided by enKo for a fair and honest review.

"HARDWAREAs a device with a form factor very similar to that of the Microsoft Surface, the Remix has most of the advantages and liabilities of that design. The kickstand makes it quite usable on a flat surface, but the magnetic coupling of the keyboard, and top-heavy nature of this design make it less stable on a lap. The Remix (and Surface) is NOT a laptop. It's something entirely different.The Remix is well provisioned with 2 Gb of RAM, 64 Gb of flash storage, and a micro-SD slot cleverly hidden under the kickstand, supporting up to 128 Gb. I am storing about 30 Gb of videos on a 32 Gb micro-SD card, which integrates seamlessly with the File Manager. Overall performance is good, and everything works well; the only nits are relatively weak sound from the side-firing speakers, and a touchpad that is not as responsive as the touchpad on a good laptop. The Remix pairs easily with a Bluetooth mouse, which is a good alternative to the touchpad. The keyboard has good feel, and because keyboard and RemixOS were designed to work with each other, there are some function keys that add special capabilities, such as accessing settings, disabling the touchpad, and searching for apps. My only real complaint is that the tablet does not wake up when you open the keyboard cover. Jide developers are aware of the need for a better way to wake a sleeping Remix other than hitting the physical power button at top right of the tablet.If you want to protect your Remix, most cases made for the Microsoft Surface will fit. I use a ProCase Wallet Sleeve Case for Surface 3http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L6620G4, which fits like it was custom made for the Remix.SOFTWARERemixOS is an Android variant, but is compatible with almost every app that I have tried to install from the Google Play Store. RemixOS does NOT support widgets at this time, which may be an issue for hardcore Android fans, but is not for me. RemixOS introduces some fairly dramatic improvements to ""pure"" Android in the form of a Windows-like taskbar at the bottom of the screen makes frequently used apps more accessible, and makes switching between apps far easier. Jide provides several dedicated apps for Mail, Calendar, Notes, and an office suite. I prefer some of them (such as Mail and Settings) to their generic Android counterparts. The other major enhancement that RemixOS adds to the Android experience permits some apps to be run in ""phone mode"" with a movable and resizable window. Phone mode can be very handy for having multiple app windows visible for what I will call ""information"" apps, such as Calendar, Google Play Music, and Pandora. The only Android feature that I really miss is the ability to create multiple, independent user accounts on one device.CONCLUSIONThe Remix Ultra-tablet and RemixOS are a very good release 1.0 effort, and in the long run RemixOS may be more important than the hardware, as it breaks new ground for Android. The Remix is a productivity tablet, not just for games and social media.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVWWQQHVGWOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHQDXEE#wasThisHelpful","R3DVWWQQHVGWOL","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first Friendly Swede purchase was the rubber tip version, a few years ago. They were a little short, and the rubber tips (like all that I have used) tended to drag on some screens.The microfiber fabric covering on this model solves that problem, and the length and balance feel ""just right"" to my hand. However, the fabric covering the tip is inherently delicate, and I can be rough on things, so the replaceable tips are well worth the small added cost.I received these as replacements for a set of three 7"" fixed tip microfiber stylii, which were less durable than I expected. When I mentioned this, Friendly Swede customer service contacted me within hours, apologized, and sent me replacements with next day delivery.

"All things considered, I prefer over-the-ear headphones to on-ear (less isolation, less bass) or in-ear (almost none fit my ear canal). They are generally more comfortable and provide better music quality, but the tradeoff is that an over-the-ear set is usually heavier, and more isolating (a plus for some uses). The Soundpeats A1 Bluetooth headphones are very similar in design to the Nakamichi Over the Ear Bluetooth Headphones BT304 (which seem to be discontinued), but cost about 25% less than the current discounted price for the Nakamichis. For the cost, this is a very nice set of cans, with some features that the Nakamichis don't have, and performance that is close, if not quite as good.Testing was done with a 2012 ASUS Nexus 7 tablet, using Google Play Music with locally stored music. My main test track was ""Cervantine"" by A Hawk and a Hacksaw, a track that includes bass drum and other percussion, a variety of brass from tuba to trumpet, strings, and accordion, with a wide tonal range. Bluetooth pairing was straightforward, with alternating red and blue lights on the left side indicating that the device was in pairing mode. Indoors signal breakup began around 45 feet, with several intervening walls, and outdoors with no intervening obstacles, connection maintained out to about 150 feet; both are very good performance, well in excess of the Bluetooth spec of ~10 meters.Included in the packaging:- 1 M USB charging cable- 1.6 M 3.5mm audio patch cable (nicer than usual, flat ribbon cable with an L and a straight connector)- Soft cloth carrying bagControls are well separated, with previous/next and start/stop buttons on the left; power Volume +- on the right. Both a micro-USB charging port and a port for a standard 3.5 mm patch cable are under a rubber plug cover (which isn't as fiddly as most). Unfortunately, the previous/next buttons do not work as expected. With most Bluetooth headsets, pressing and holding the previous next buttons does fast back or fast forward within a track. With this set, they only support click to start from the beginning of the previous track, or to advance to the next track (in fairness, this was not described as a feature in the user manual). Other than this, all controls worked as expected, with good separation and tactile feedback.Especially noteworthy is the right headphone, which has a user-replaceable BP-6X lithium ion battery, a feature I have never seen before on a rechargeable BT headset of this type. With most such units, the battery is sealed, and if it dies (they all do eventually), you are out of luck, unless you want to try surgery. Claimed battery life is ~12 hours. The BP-6X battery is a very common size, used in Motorola Droid phones, and is available on Amazon for just over $3. The manual lists battery capacity as 450 mAh, while BP-6 batteries for the Droid are rated at up to 1390 mAh. Assuming play time is linear, the higher capacity battery should deliver about 36 hours of listening on a single charge.Both the headband and the earphones are amply padded, and extremely comfortable; the Nakamichi phones might have a slight advantage because their padded covering is perforated. Weight is nearly identical at a claimed 200 grams for the Nakamich vs 210 grams for the Soundpeats A1.The Soundpeats A1 delivers slightly less volume, and slightly muffled compared with the Nakamichi, which also has more ""presence."" Except when compared with the Nakamich headset, the Soundpeats A1 beats every other Bluetooth headset I have ever used.+++Pros+++- Very comfortable- Excellent controls- Good sound quality- Can be used wirelessly or with a patch cord- Fold flat for travel- Inexpensive user-replaceable battery- Good user guide, printed in a size that is actually eye readable- No frustration packaging---Cons---- No fast forward/fast rewind capability- Slightly muffled sound (but only when compared with higher spec headphones)===Bottom Line===The Soundpeats A1 Bluetooth Headphones are better than average at this price point, with decent (if not outstanding) sound, comfortable, and with quite a few extras not found in the competition.Disclaimer: I received this product free from the vendor in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EQYC7KIOJ647/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STPHMI6#wasThisHelpful","R3EQYC7KIOJ647","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Etekcity RoverBeats F1 bluetooth on-ear headphones are mid-size, with a hard plastic band. The user's manual covers the operational basics, which are similar to other BT headsets. All operational controls are on the right side, using the standard marking conventions (volume +-, |<<  >>| with a concave start/stop button in the middle. A micro-USB charging port is at the bottom of the right headphone.Testing was done with a Nexus 7 tablet, playing music downloaded from Google Play Music. Bluetooth range is middling, barely meeting the minimum requirement of 10 meters (with intervening walls) indoors. Most other Bluetooth devices that I have used maintain connection out to about 40-50% greater distances before breaking up. I did not test the built-in microphone.These are ""on-ear"" not ""over the ear"" headphones, so there is relatively little isolation from the outside world, which is either a plus or a minus, depending on one's preference. Claimed frequency response, 20-20kHz is optimistic; 100-8kHz seems more realistic. Low bass was lacking, and more noticeably treble when compared with a more expensive set of Nakamichi over-the-ear headphones. Sound quality and volume are fine for ""easy listening"" but these are far from audiophile headphones.++ Pros ++- Relatively light weight.- Build quality feels solid, and fit and finish are good.- Paired easily with 2 different Android tablets, 2 Chromebooks, an iMac and a Macbook.- Decent battery life, ~10 hours.- Start/Stop button is easily identified by touch- Acceptable sound quality for the price-- Cons --- The plastic band has very little no padding on the underside. Even though it provided plenty of tension, the band tended to slip back and forth.- Limited adjustability. Standard in/out with about an inch of travel on each side. The headphones themselves can be rotated about 15, but there is very little movement in other planes. I wear glasses, and even with thin temples, these headphones were not terribly comfortable. But head and ear shapes vary tremendously, so what is uncomfortable for one person may be fine for another.- While the start/stop button is very easy to find, the volume +- and forward/backward buttons are stiff, with almost no separation, and no tactile differentiation. Worse, the ""click area"" is where the buttons almost touch, so it is difficult to change volume without inadvertently skipping a track.- This is not a folding design, and is not particularly well suited for travel.== Bottom line ==The Etekcity RoverBeats F1 bluetooth on-ear headphones provide decent value for the price.

"The size of a typical USB flash drive, this is an incredibly tiny device, considering what it does. Turn it on, wait ~15 seconds for the red LED to turn blue, start recording. To stop recording, turn it off. The 15 second delay is useful, as it allows positioning the recorder before recording starts.Each clip is limited to about 4 hours of recorded sound, and a 20 minute clip occupies about 2.6 Mb.

"Rechargable power packs have become so common that I almost expect one to show up in a cereal box ""Free Power Bank Inside!"" They all do essentially the same thing, and all other things being equal, you need to choose between capacity, weight, and speed. Generally speaking, the greater the capacity, the heavier the device, from purse size 2000 mAh units to 20,000+ monsters packing enough juice to start a car. Within those parameters, vendors distinguish themselves by design and extras.At 10,400 mAh, the Foxnovo is in the midrange of what is currently available, and distinguishes itself by elegant packaging and extras, including a flat ribbon hydra power cable with USB micro type-A, USB micro type-B (aka USB 3), ""classic"" Apple 30-pin, and Apple ""Lightning"" connectors, covering the majority of contemporary USB devices. I don't have any iOS devices, so while travelling, I prefer to carry separate cables with USB mini and micro connectors. The matte finish aluminum case complements most devices from Apple.Four small blue LEDs indicate the state of charge; mine arrived showing 2 LEDs (<50% charge), and took approximately 5:15 to reach 100% charge (4 LEDS, no blinking) on a 2 Amp Nexus USB charger. In the enclosed documentation, self charging time is listed at 8-10 hours, presumably for a fully discharged unit. A small push button, labeled ON/OFF, is just right of the USB-micro charging port. Using the 2.1 Amp port, a 2012 Nexus 7 that was 50% discharged (4325 mAh battery) took approximately 5 hours to reach 100%, with the power pack still showing 3 LEDs. The aluminum case never got warm to the touch while being charged or while charging another device. Based on this charging test, claimed battery capacity seems accurate, but the 2.1 Amp port is delivering less current than claimed. For comparison, a Patriot Fuel+ rated at 9000 mAh completed the same charging test in 1:55 using its 2.5 Amp port. The Patriot Fuel+ remains my favorite among this class of device; although the Fuel+ chunkier and not as elegant, performance is important, and the plastic case is tougher than aluminum.Other minor points: a nicer than usual plush carrying case is included, with an outside pouch for the charging cable. Packaging is a simple cardboard box with a closed cell foam liner  easy to open and recyclable. Documentation (in English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian) is sparse, but covers everything that needs to be covered.A card in the box proclaims a ""lifetime"" warranty: ""If you have any problem at anytime with our products, we will replace it. Done and Done."" However... in an answer to a customer question on June 2, a Foxnovo representative provided contradictory information:""The product includes 30 days refund and 90 days replacement return policy, as well as.We will cover the return shipping fee of defective products within return policy.""All in all, this is one of the nicer power packs that I have used; it's not the smallest or lightest, but offers a decent amount of power in an elegant package that is pleasing to the eye as well as to the hand. It's going into my travel bag. Four stars because of conflicting statements about the warranty, as well as slower than expected time to charge a 7"" tablet.Disclaimer : I received this product for free, in exchange for a fair and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JTIUPCM21PZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV8ZEJK#wasThisHelpful","R1JTIUPCM21PZC","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The different strengths it takes to pull the four looped, broad bands (green-light, blue-medium, red-heavy, black-extra heavy) are quite noticeable without even pulling on them. The bands thicken as the levels advance from the lightest to the heaviest. They fold up very nicely to fit in the provided, tiny 5"" x 3"" bag for stowing in purse or luggage, so you can keep in shape while traveling.The exercise DVD provided is divided into chapters (warm-up, upper body, abdominals, lower body, ending stretch). You can do all chapters at once (1 hour duration) or pick specific areas to view. The the visual quality of the DVD is good, and Linda Woodridge gives helpful hints throughout on how to adjust the exercises to one's own capabilities without being belittling or overly perky. Her voice is pleasant and kept to a moderate level-neither too soft or too loud. I found it thoughtful of her that she only used the green and blue bands to encourage beginners and prevent strain injuries from trying to keep up with the heavier bands. There are quite a lot of exercises, many of which I've done in the past without the bands. Doing all the exercises along with her for an hour is exhausting and maybe too much for beginners, and as she advises stop during an exercise if too tired. You don't have to work through the entire DVD in one session.It would have been helpful if she had given recommendations for the number of repetitions in each set of exercises. She only counted at the last 5-8 repetitions of each exercise. With so many exercises to do in an hour, it would be hard to memorize the full workout to enable one to do it without the DVD or a download of it.Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9CRSQOHS3QH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3AIOE0#wasThisHelpful","R9CRSQOHS3QH5","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 2: Friendly Swede customer support is top notch. With hours of my update about the problem I had with the fabric covering coming off the tip, the contacted me, apologized, and offered to send a replacement. Such responsiveness for a low-tech item like a stylus is surprising, and they have earned my customer loyalty.UPDATE: The fabric covering the rubber tip is not well-secured by the retaining ring; I suspect this is a quality control issue, with the cloth being cut to closely. As a result, the covering of one stylus started to come off after only a few weeks of light use, and another is visibly not well attached. Stylus behavior and feel is good, but durability is not, and the replaceable tip models are a better choice.I've been using a pack of 3.5"" Friendly Swede stylii for some time, and found that the rubber tips do not work particularly well with a Remix Ultra Tablet, so I decided to give these a try. The tablet responds instantly, and the fiber tip glides much more smoothly.Since I found the 4.5 inch stylus a little short, I decided to try the 7.3"" model. It's a little too big for my taste. Fortunately, the cap is a simple press fit in a thin aluminum tube, so I removed the cap, shortened the tube, and ended up with a 5.5"" stylus which feels ""just right"" to my hand. You can always cut down a stylus that is too long, but you can't lengthen one that is too short.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11L1ORPS1N6LA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRY56YW#wasThisHelpful","R11L1ORPS1N6LA","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless you are backpacking, where every ounce counts, 8X40 may be the sweet spot for non-stabilized binoculars: Neither too heavy nor too light 40 mm objective gathers more light, allowing a larger exit pupil 8X magnification is easier to hold steady than higher magnificationAll controls on the DBPOWER 8x40 binoculars operate smoothly. I did *not* test to see if they are truly waterproof, but I would take all such claims with a grain of salt. The rubber covering makes them comfortable to hold, and should provide some impact protection, if dropped.Not an apples to oranges comparison, but I compared these with my old set of Nikon compact 9x25 binoculars. The 8x40 are, of course, larger and heavier, but the larger exit pupil provides more freedom of movement, and the larger objective makes them much brighter. The image was sharp, with good contrast, without noticeable change in either illumination or sharpness from center to edge. Closest focus with the DBPOWER is about 6 meters; Nikon focuses perhaps a half meter closer.My only complaint is the relatively flexible yoke that holds the eyepieces, which makes it difficult to achieve and retain the same focus from both eyepieces. Other than this, the design appears to be quite substantial. I appreciate that the rubber cover for the eyepieces has a slot for the strap  no more lost cover.These binoculars appear to be identical to the Bestek 8x40 binoculars, also sold on Amazon.Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSIW1Y4RD9NQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5UNTO6#wasThisHelpful","R3BSIW1Y4RD9NQ","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE: After several months of usage, run time, whether plugged in or operating from battery has dropped to about 30 minutes, which  limits the usefulness of this lamp. I still love the design, but it isn't aging well.My 15-year old clip-on reading light uses a small flashlight bulb, which illuminates only a small field, and that not terribly brightly. The power switch is fiddly, and increasingly unreliable. Pardon the pun, but the difference between new and old is like the difference between night and dayThe DBPOWER light had a decent charge when received, and charged fully in less than an hour (a red charging LED shines through the base while it's charging). A minor nit, this light uses an uncommon power cable, USB Type-A on one end, with a 3.5 mm right angle barrel connector on the other end, rather than USB mini or micro. So, if you want to travel, you pack its power cable, rather than use a generic USB cable or cellphone charger. If you lose the cable, search Amazon for ""3.5 mm barrel to usb""  replacements are available from $0.99 upward. On the other hand, the barrel connector doesn't require aligning with the socket, and is probably more rugged than a USB micro connector, so ultimately, the charging cable has no bearing on the performance of the light.The headboard of my bed won't accept a clip-on lamp, and the base of this lamp is rather light, so the neck can't be moved very far off center without tipping; I solved this by putting a ~1 oz weight in the base.A mere brush of the finger is all that's required to turn the light on (lowest; tap again for middle, again for brightest). The brightest level is quite bright  possibly too bright for reading in bed, something I haven't tried yet. Despite a linear array of 14 LEDs, the light  field is roughly circular, so orientation doesn't matter. The light is a relatively ""pure"" white, neither yellowish nor bluish. After turning the light on to high, I let it run until the battery was exhausted, about 4 hours. After plugging it back in to the charger, the light was immediately usable at any of the brightness settings.Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P4C1WNGZJF7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QK7DJ1O#wasThisHelpful","R3P4C1WNGZJF7X","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm between 3 and 4 stars for this Bluetooth mouse.== Pros ==I like the shape, the matte finish, and most especially the fact that it's rechargeable  no extra batteries to carry on a trip, and I always travel with an array of USB cables and chargers. Tracking action is fine, the left and right buttons provide reasonable feedback, and the scroll wheel has a nice feel.== Cons ==The instructions are terrible. After trying, and failing multiple times to pair by pushing the (unlabeled) pairing button, I succeeded by tapping it several times. The tracking light is red, and when in pairing mode, as with many Bluetooth devices, a blue light flashes on the underside. After some initial pairing issues, it paired successfully and identified itself as ""Bluetooth_Mouse"" with a desktop iMac, 2 different Chromebooks, and a Remix ultra-tablet.I expected the multiple DPI selection to be more useful than it is, but the the only way to tell which resolution is in effect is to move the mouse pointer in a circle: big circle = low DPI; small circle = high DPI. Click the small button just behind the scroll wheel to change DPI, cycling through all 3 settings. Instead of a button, a 3-position switch, indicating which DPI has been chosen, would be more useful.On a completely subjective basis, I prefer the heft of a heavier mouse, such as one with 2 AA batteries, but if you like a lighter mouse, this may be a good choice.So, 4 stars for functionality, 2 stars for documentation. You only set up a device like this once, and probably soon lose the documentation, so in the long run functionality trumps documentation.Disclaimer: I was sent this mouse as a review unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MMCRIUITRSW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO5D308#wasThisHelpful","R2MMCRIUITRSW9","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"== Pros ==Where I live we have more power outages than I would like, so it's a good to have an emergency light that is easy to deploy in the dark. This is a basic collapsible lantern, easy to turn on by expanding the case  no switch to hunt for in the dark. I recruited my neighbor's daughter as a test subject; she proved that it is literally so easy to use that a 2-year old can turn it on and off.Not obvious from the photos, but the envelope surrounding the LED array is frosted, providing diffused light; also, the case itself is translucent, so some light passes through it. You can vary the light output by sliding the top part way down, but this just reduces the size of the opening through which light is transmitted, rather than reducing the amount of power used by the 120 lumen LED. To test battery life, I sacrificed 3 AA batteries (Eveready Gold, expiration date 12/2024) by letting the lantern run until the batteries were exhausted. I gave up after 48 hours over the course of 4 days. By that time the light was about as bright as a night light, but it was still visible.Although I did not observe the transition from full bright to a lower level, I wonder if power is reduced automatically after some period to extend run time.I had no need to test it, but I was impressed by the seller's promise they they ""...will ALWAYS replace a faulty product or refund your purchase!"" Few products come with that sort of guarantee.== Cons ==As other reviewers have noted, there is a strong plastic smell when the package is first opened; placing the lantern in strong sunlight for a full day should eliminate most of the smell.I'm not convinced of the usefulness of the unlighted compass, which seems like an add-on gimmick.Disclaimer : I received a free coupon for providing an honest and unbiased review.

"Due to the sensor technology used in these devices, I suspect there may be wide variations in accuracy. In my case, I seem to have gotten a good one, and while setting it up with both the indoor and outdoor sensors in the same location for over an hour, each reported almost identical temperature and humidity readings, with the temperature corresponding with an instant read digital cooking thermometer.My only real complaint is that the clock isn't an atomic clock, so it has to be reset periodically against a known time source.The display is quite readable in normal light, and the blue backlight works fine to get a quick read in the dark.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76GWPEG5YGCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYX7B2Q#wasThisHelpful","R76GWPEG5YGCT","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These work as described, and are good for lighting a deck, but beware that each bulb uses 40 W, so 24 X 40 = 960 Watts. Packaging is protective, but somewhat inconvenient, as each bulb has to be unscrewed from its socket to remove it from the cardboard carrier, an action that has to be repeated 24 times. I managed to break 3 bulbs while extending the string, but they are wired in parallel, so the light string continues to work, even with missing bulbs.

"HARDWAREAs a device with a form factor very similar to that of the Microsoft Surface, the Remix has most of the advantages and liabilities of that design. The kickstand makes it quite usable on a flat surface, but the magnetic coupling of the keyboard, and top-heavy nature of this design make it less stable on a lap. The Remix (and Surface) is NOT a laptop. It's something entirely different.The Remix is well provisioned with 2 Gb of RAM, 64 Gb of flash storage, and a slot cleverly hidden under the kickstand supports micro-SD cards up to 128 Gb. I am storing about 30 Gb of videos on a 32 Gb micro-SD card, which integrates seamlessly with the File Manager. Overall performance is good, and everything works well; the only nits are relatively weak sound from the side-firing speakers, and a touchpad that is not as responsive as the touchpad on a good laptop. The Remix pairs easily with a Bluetooth mouse, which is a good alternative to the touchpad. The keyboard has good feel, and because keyboard and RemixOS were designed to work with each other, there are some function keys that add special capabilities, such as accessing settings, disabling the touchpad, and searching for apps. My only real complaint is that the tablet does not wake up when you open the keyboard cover, nor does tapping a key reliably wake it up. Jide developers are aware of the need for a better way to wake a sleeping Remix other than hitting the physical power button at top right of the tablet.If you want to protect your Remix, most cases made for the Microsoft Surface will fit. I use a ProCase Wallet Sleeve Case for Surface 3http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L6620G4, which fits like it was custom made for the Remix.SOFTWARERemixOS is an Android variant, but is compatible with almost every app that I have tried to install from the Google Play Store. RemixOS does NOT support widgets at this time, which may be an issue for hardcore Android fans, but is not for me. RemixOS introduces some fairly dramatic improvements to ""pure"" Android (my only previous Android experience is with Google Nexus 7 tablets, running both KitKat and Lollipop). A Windows-like taskbar at the bottom of the screen makes frequently used apps more accessible, and makes switching between apps far easier. Jide provides several dedicated apps for Mail, Calendar, Notes, and an office suite. I prefer some of them (such as Mail and Settings) to their Google counterparts. The other major enhancement that RemixOS adds to the Android experience permits some apps to be run in ""phone mode"" with a movable (but not yet resizable) window. Phone mode can be very handy for having multiple app windows visible for what I will call ""information"" apps, such as Calendar, Google Play Music, and Pandora. Not all apps (including most of those from Jide) can be run in phone mode. The only Android software feature that I really miss is the ability to create multiple, independent user accounts on one device.CONCLUSIONAlthough Jide is working on a 2nd generation Remix, this year's model is an excellent start. Software evolves, and early in this product's life, one should anticipate frequent updates. RemixOS 1.5 (based on Android Lollipop) will start beta testing in June, and should be released this summer. The Remix Ultra-tablet and RemixOS are a very good release 1.0 effort, and in the long run RemixOS may be more important than the hardware, as it breaks new ground for Android. The Remix is a productivity tablet, not just for games and social media.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24HWUD453YL42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XCRJ428#wasThisHelpful","R24HWUD453YL42","AD1MRUOBFE8FG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD1MRUOBFE8FG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Initially, I was  somewhat skeptical of this product, mainly because the ropes that attach the handles to the actual cutting chain seemed to provide no control over its alignment. However, once a cut is started, it cuts in a straight line. The plastic handles provide a good grip, but it began to jam about half way while cutting the 2.5"" trunk of a small dead shrub (which was slightly tilted from the vertical, so I was making the cut in a way such that the gap would open while cutting). The teeth really are quite sharp, and in the right circumstances, such as cutting brush for a campfire, this is a useful tool for a camper or backpacker, and it stows easily in its cloth carrying pouch.In some ways, this is like Dr. Johnson's comment about ""a dog's walking on his hind legs.

"I've been hooked on memory foam pillows for over a decade, and when asked to review this one on the eve of a trip that would include a stay at a B&B that I knew had thin, soft pillows, I eagerly accepted the offer.The SmarterRest pillow is packaged nicer than most, and the bundled sleep mask and ear plugs are appreciated (we have been staying next to a restaurant/bar for the past week). It's slightly thinner and firmer than most, but has a feature I haven't seen before: there is a slight depression in the middle of the pillow, where your neck and head rest. Some other reviewers have noted an odor; I detected none (but my sense of smell is not the greatest).

"November 18, 2015 UpdateI really wish Braven would not have designed this speaker with a special power supply cord requirement. I've spent almost two hours scouring through my various USB cables and power bricks trying to locate the one Braven power cable. I haven't found it yet. I'm taking another star off of my review due to this design. It's really irritating.Original ReviewBraven makes high priced and high quality Bluetooth speakers. This one is no exception. It is a very nice product.We already have another Braven Bluetooth Speaker, the BRAVEN BRV-HD [Water-Resistant][28 Hour Playtime] - Black]]. It has great sound but is large, heavy, and quite expensive. While it is battery operated, fully portable, and Bluetooth I would hardly call it portable. We keep the BRV-HD in the kitchen in a permanent spot. When I saw this smaller, lighter Braven Balance I thought it would be a truly portable unit. And a good one given that it comes from Braven.I weighed it with my digital scale at 29 ounces. Quite acceptable to carry in a backpack if you want the type of sound quality this Balance produces. I also have an LG Music-Flow with quite good sound quality that weighs just over 25 ounces and I carry it around the house for morning shaving, painting a room, or working in the garage. I expect I'll be using the Balance for most of those events from now on. A small increase in weight over what I've been using is a very small price to pay for better sound, and the Balance has a USB port to charge other devices. The Balance provides much better sound than the LG Music-Flow.The IPX7 waterproof rating means it's good for being submerged for 30 minutes down to 1 meter. To me that is good protection for an accidental drop into our spa, or if it's forgotten out in the rain. It also means it can be used on the beach because sand won't get into it and wet hands won't bother it.Now to the sound quality.- Treble is very good. I am very fussy about high sounds since I can hear up to 18KHz.- Mid-range is very good. This is not only good for music but I listen to a lot of audio podcasts.- Base. For a speaker of this size the base is quite good. There is still a slight muffling to the base but not much. I like the base of the Balance more than the larger Braven BRV-HD. This muffling seems to be a Braven trait because even the much larger BRV-HD exhibits more muffling in the base. It is a circuit designers choice how to tweak sounds and Braven seems to tend toward this characteristic.I like the shape of this speaker. It is easy to fit in my hand, and it seems quite well proportioned for the largest speakers in the smallest package. The outside is all covered in a soft rubbery material that, with care, looks like it will wear well.  The end caps act as a sub-woofer. The caps are almost like a speaker themselves as they flex quite a bit with a little finger pressure. I'm sure this adds to the base quality of the Balance. The bottom is flat and about 1 1/2"" x 7"" so it sits firmly on a shelf. They designed in four small feet on the back so it can be laid on it's back.My biggest complaint with this speaker is the very loud female voice that come in to announce status changes like being connected via Bluetooth. It is very loud and pays no attention to the volume buttons.Pros:- Battery check button and 5 LED lights to show charge state.- Easy to pair with my two smartphones and tablet. It even paired easily with my 5-year-old's kids tablet.- Reasonable weight for the size, sound quality, and features- Good sound quality- USB charge port- Can be used as a speakerphone.- Built in Boost EQ setting- 18 hours of battery life (untested by me). Battery life will be reduced if the Balance is also used to charge another device.- I had no color choice as this was a free product. Fortunately for me this purple color is way over on the blue side.Cons:- The Braven Balance comes with a wall charger. I would really prefer that it would use a micro USB input to charge it. Micro USB is certainly capable as it is used in my 20,000 MAh Anker external battery, so charging 4,000 MAh battery would work well. Since the Balance has an ac cord with a brick on the end I'm forced to take it with me if I travel with the Balance.- The A/C Brick on the charge cord for the Balance has a snap in connector for United States A/C outlets. There are three more for overseas outlets. I would have preferred, since I'm forced to carry the brick, a folding U.S. compatible plug arrangement. For travel I'll remove the protruding AC adapter and have to make sure I carry that separate piece along as well.- As far as I can tell it has a non user-replaceable battery. This is a hot button for me as with most electronic products these days the battery will fail long before the rest of the product.- When the Balance is connected a room filling loud female voice says ""Audio device connected"" I find this rather annoying. This means I won't be able to use the Balance in our master bath while my wife is sleeping in the next room. I actually had a small inexpensive Bluetooth speaker that did the same thing and I gave that device to someone else just because of this same feature. A blinking light is sufficient.- When turning the Boost feature on a quite loud female voice says ""Enabled"" There appears to be no way to turn this voice feature off or turn it down. I had the speaker playing music at a low volume when I attempted to try the Boost feature and was unpleasantly surprised by the very loud voice announcement. I consider this a quite negative feature of this Braven product.Comparing three Bluetooth Speakers I have...The LG Electronics NP7550 comes in at $148 and, while a nice speaker with good sound, doesn't hold a candle to the Braven Balance. The LG advertises up to 10 hours battery life but I get about four.The Braven BRV-HD comes in at $300, sounds better, but I consider it not to be a truly portable device due to the size and weight.From these three I'll choose the $130 Braven Balance every time. I reduced by one star due to the very loud status announcements. I sent an email to Braven support regarding this feature, asking if it could be disabled or at least change the volume of the announcements.As long as you are okay with the loud announcements I highly recommend the Braven Balance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVCCFLFP19R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZKTKWOU#wasThisHelpful","RDVCCFLFP19R5","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sound quality 4 out of 5Comfort 3 out of 5Features 5 out of 5Pros:- An included 3.5mm to 3.5mm cord allows use with devices that are not Bluetooth, or to use the headset if the battery is low.- 10 hours (not fully tested by me yet) of battery life with only 1.5 hours of charge time.- Volume up/down, Next/Previous track, Stop/Start buttons nicely designed into the right side of the headset- Built in microphone for- Bluetooth straight line tested to work out to 30' from source- Easy to pair- Light weight- Answer/hangup phone control- Price is midrangeCons:- Rigid earphones do not allow the headset to adjust to ones specific ears.- Music quality is just okay but base is muffled- Non user replaceable battery. If it goes bad or deteriorates there is no recourse but to revert to using them wired. It could be so easy to design in replaceable batteries.These will be great for my five-year-old son. He has gone through 4 sets of inexpensive earphones, all because the cord has broken. Keeping these charged will be an extra step but at least the cord won't be a problem. To me the sound quality isn't good enough for my use.For the price these are okay headphones. If you desire high quality sound you may want to look elsewhere. If maximum comfort is a concern these might be okay for short periods but to me I wouldn't wear them for more than an hour. These are on-ear rather than over-ear headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AFQPC5TH3QUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MBZN4A#wasThisHelpful","R3AFQPC5TH3QUS","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Five stars given the price. This is actually a decent cover for this price.The leather isn't real but nonetheless it is a very nice leather looking material with a soft protective cover for the vitalASC tablet. The cover fits the vitalASC quite well, but as another reviewer said lining up the cameras with the openings in the case is problematic. I believe if the openings were made larger that would be a non issue.After inserting the tablet there is a nice flap with Velcro on the end to hold it firmly in place. The case does not overlap onto the screen. There is a loop to hold a touch pen. A magnetic latch is built into the cover to help keep the front cover in place.  There is an opening on the rear for the speaker.I'm not sure why there are two 1"" size holes on the back. I can't imagine what purpose they serve. Perhaps heat relief? If they were willing to put those two large holes in the back they should have no problem making the camera openings a bit larger.The cover folds back to make a stand. There is no way to adjust the angle of the tablet on the stand. But just having the tablet on the stand will be great. I have a Bluetooth keyboard to use with the tablet but really needed the cover/stand.If you own or are purchasing a vitalASC 9"" tablet I recommend this cover.Now I wish I could find a screen protector for the vitalASC...","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34O3CSO5S1S2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM8CJCA#wasThisHelpful","R34O3CSO5S1S2G","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe in the quality of Meguiar's products. I've used them for years. This Marine Wash-N-Wax promises cleaning of salt spots, and adding UV protection, among others. I used it to wash our boat within 15 minutes of receiving the product.I really liked the thickness of the product, and how it made a nice head of foam in the wash bucket. I followed the directions which were just a little odd.1) Wet the boat hull first2) Apply the M42323) Wash off but not with a spray but rather a flow of water.4) Don't let it dry but use a cloth to polish and dry the hullIn my case I didn't notice any appreciable increase in the shine on my boat hull, but I rarely do. My boat is shiny all the time and is rarely water spotted or dirty. Also we boat in fresh water so we don't have to deal with salt spots. Not that I'm a stranger to salt spots.For over 20 years we lived near the Southern California ocean and had to deal regularly with salt spray. At that time I learned there were few products better than household vinegar to deal with dried salt spots. I also used Salt Terminator or SaltAway which worked well. But then I would still have to follow up with a wash soap of some kind. Having a Wash-N-Wax product that removed salt spots would have been a huge time saver. So for those that deal with salt spots I'd give this a try.Don't hate me but our boat always comes home from our two local lakes washed clean. The lakes here are so clean, basically as good as the fresh water that comes out of our taps, that the boat is being washed while we use it on the lake. We don't even have water spots after we let the boat air dry because of the low instance of minerals in our lakes. Still I'll appreciate this product for those times I do wash the boat. It can get dusty and pick up some dirt on the short drive home from the lake.I especially appreciate this product having UV protection in the mix.The finish was indeed streak free which was much appreciated.The only reason for not giving it five stars is I can't test the salt spot removing capability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HMHTO75KDOLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00355GPQA#wasThisHelpful","R2HMHTO75KDOLJ","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update 16 October, 2015I've now received email from LeapFrog stating they are aware of the problems with the Weather App and are working on a fix. They also stated that the two apps of ours, Jack and the Neverland Pirates and Hot Wheels Raceway Reading, are targeted to work on the Epic.It is good to have this rapid feedback from LeapFrog.I plugged in a 32GB microSDHC card today. Now the Epic has 48GB of memory, enough to load quite a few full length movies for a two week vacation coming up soon. The Epic is turning out to be a great little product.Original ReviewWe received the Epic today and I must say this is the first LeapFrog tablet that I think is a very good one. I will expand my review when we've had more time on it but here is the initial report.Pros:- Crisp screen and good viewing angles. It is actually a very nice viewing experience.- Decent brightness, we've used it exclusively outside in the shade thus far and it is fine.- Good volume although the speaker is on the back so easy to cover with a hand or by laying it on a table.- Much heavier than a common 7"" tablet but not unlike a LeapPad Ultra or LeapPad Platinum. My five-year-old has not complained about the weight.- Home screens (there are several) are fun and full of features. Much better than the other LeapPad products.- The green bumper around the edge is firmly in place but can be removed.- There are only three buttons; power, volume up, and volume down- Lots of parent control options.- Bluetooth. Finally my son can use a bluetooth headset. We've gone through 4 headsets, each time the cord has failed.- The microSD card slot allows an additional 32GB of storage to be added to the Epic. Good job LeapFrog on this one!- LeapFrog Epic does not work with the computer based LeapFrog Connect. I guess that is a good thing. Apparently all that is needed is a WiFi connection for all downloads.- Full unrestricted browser available to parents only. Lacking some functionality though, for example if you download a .PDF file there is no reader (perhaps one could be downloaded?)- LeafFrog finally converted to a micro USB connector on the Epic. That make it compatible with most of the USB cables in our house. I always had to go looking for a special cable for the LeapFrog products.- I already knew that app cartridges won't work so that isn't a negative for this one. I don't consider that a big problem because I never liked the game cartridges in the first place.- I copied some of our son's favorite movies to the Epic. Finally he can watch movies on road trips. Yea.Cons:- Like so many other products these days the rechargeable batteries are not replaceable. That means the battery will slowly deteriorate over time and I wonder how we will be able to put in a fresh rechargeable battery. This is a big hot button for me.- App prices from LeapFrog are way out of balance with other apps on tablets and smartphones. They claim it is due to how much they spend developing the apps but other apps costing much less also have had a great deal of cost to develop as well. I've noticed a slight shift downward in app prices. Perhaps LeapFrog is getting the message.- Some apps hide the ""back"" and ""home"" buttons on the bottom of the screen so it seems there is no way to exit the app. I've learned hitting the power button twice quickly brings it back to the home screen.- The weather app seems to work for others but not for us. I've sent in a trouble report to LeapFrog.LeapFrog says hundreds of apps that run on the LeapPad series will work on the Epic.Apps that are not compatible in our case:- Hot Wheels Raceway Reading- Jake and the Neverland PiratesI'm a little bummed about those two apps not working on the Epic. They are both great games and some of our son's favorites.Apps that are compatible in our case:- Letter Factory Adventures: The Letter Machine Rescue Team- Letter Factory Adventures. Counting on Lemonaid- Sammy Submariner.- Get Ready for Kindergarten: Stretchy Monkey's Super DayIn general I strongly recommend the Epic. I definitely recommend the Epic over any other LeapPad that has been produced by LeapFrog. I think they have a winner on their hands this time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G5JKLPKQG0DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NMTJA6#wasThisHelpful","R1G5JKLPKQG0DG","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Better than the cushions I've been using but too thin or too soft.I weigh about 220 pounds. When I sit on this cushion I can feel the chair seat under the cushion. So it is either too thin for someone of my weight, or the foam is not sufficiently firm. I think the issue is the foam is not firm enough.

"I must say evaluating a router isn't easy. I spent over 4 hours, making changes, doing tests, and writing this report.There are two things I'm interested in with a WiFi router. 1) How easy is it to setup. 2) How fast is it.If you don't like reading long detailed reviews here is the synopsis: The setup was easy, the signal strength was good, and the data transfer rates were good. I recommend this router.If you like more detail read on...SETUPThis is the easiest to setup router I've ever used, and I've had perhaps 10 WiFi routers over the years. I disconnected the previous router, connected all of the cables to this router, and powered it up. With a browser I went to address 192.168.1.1 and logged in (using the username and password from the documentation). I selected the automatic setup and went through a couple of steps, renaming the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and setting my own choice of password. That was pretty much it. All of my WiFi devices just worked as did the 1TB hard drive I plugged into the USB port. I did have to map the 1TB drive to our computers which was an expected extra step.SPEEDThis is a much more difficult thing to test. There are many variables and signal issues to consider. There are ""channels"", ""bands"", signal strength, and data transfer rates.In the end, to give you the short version, I found this router to be better than the relatively new TP_Link AC router it will replace. But it isn't magic. It might take some experimentation to squeeze the best behavior out of this Linksys.When using the 2.4GHz band other devices such as cordless phones and baby monitors can be on the same band and reduce the signal strength. When running WiFi tests on my smartphone one of the weakest channels is always the channel I'm on. That's because my phone is using a lot of the bandwidth on that channel and mode. That alone reduces the measured signal strength on that channel. Of course all of the neighbors have WiFi and several devices such as tablets, laptops, smartphones, ROKU, and other devices that can interfere with the available signal strength.We are on a cable modem, not a DSL line. DSL offers slower data rates but the data rate is constant. With DSL you're not sharing the bandwidth with your neighbors. With cable we share the bandwidth with many other people so the bandwidth increases and decreases as other people in the neighborhood use the internet.So trying to evaluate one WiFi router vs another isn't easy because so many things can cause signal strength and data rate variations during testing. But there isn't much I can do about that so I just went ahead and ran the two tests at my disposal. One is an app on my smartphone called WiFi Analyzer, and the other is the widely known SpeedTest.My test method was this: I first ran tests using my old WiFi Router. I went to the four corners of our tract home lot. At each corner I ran both the WiFi Analyzer and SpeedTest, recording the results. I then replaced the old TP-Link AC1200 WiFi router with this Linksys WRT AC1900 Dual-Band Smart WiFi Router and ran the tests again. We live in a single story detached wood frame home. The WiFi router is mounted somewhat off center of the house on top of a 6' high wood cabinet.I ran most of the tests on the 2.4GHz band because I have some devices that only run on that band. I did do one test on the 5GHz band and the results were good, but as the old TP-Link router didn't have a ""B"" mode 5GHz WiFi option I could not run comparison tests. I have zero devices with the new AC mode so could run no tests at all for that mode. I suspect most people have no or few AC mode devices. AC devices have been out for a while but I have not had a need to replace any of our devices and many new devices still don't come with the AC mode. We've installed two WiFi printers recently and both only have the 2.4GHz band.The results were far less than positive for the Linksys in terms of signal strength at first. So I fiddled with two variables.The first change I tried was to install High Gain antennas on the Linksys replacing the four small antennas included. I had previously installed the new High Gain antennas on the TP-Link, which at the time made very little difference while running the same tests. I took the High Gain, much larger, antennas off the TP-Link and installed them on the new Linksys. The results were worse than the stock antennas. Length of the antenna isn't an indicator of a better signal. I have a background in electronics and spent 4 years on military radar so I understand antennas are tuned. My advice to myself and others is don't waste your money on high gain antennas.The second change I made was to the channel. The TP-Link router had automatically chosen channel 6, but the new Linksys had automatically chosen channel 1. So, after achieving poor results on channel 1, I modified the Linksys to also use channel 6, and then reran the tests. This was more like comparing apples to apples. In this case the Linksys was superior, but I have to wonder why it would have selected channel 1 which was weaker. I will post photos of the screenshots showing the signal strength comparisons.The next test was SpeedTest. It's important to note that signal strength and data throughput are linked but somewhat independent. It is quite possible to have a weak signal but fast upload and download speed.In almost all cases the new Linksys router provided faster download speeds than the TP-Link. So the new Linksys came through in my case.Before going on to other features of the Linksys, what would I choose? At this point I favor the new Linksys for better signal strength and data speed. I will post a 'photo' of the small spreadsheet I put together from the data I collected. But here is a brief limited comparison. These results were with both routers on channel 6.Location 1: TP_Link download 14.04 Mbps, signal strength 3/10.  Linksys  download 17.76 Mbps, signal strength 3/10Location 2: TP_Link download 12.24 Mbps, signal strength 1/10  Linksys  download 22.56 Mbps, signal strength 3/10Location 3: TP_Link download  8.38 Mbps, signal strength  2.0/10  Linksys  download  5.06 Mbps, signal strength  2.5/10Location 4: TP_Link download 17.51 Mbps, signal strength 0/10  Linksys  download 21.04 Mbps, signal strength 3/10OTHER FEATURESBoth my old router and the Linksys are gigabit routers. However in our house we keep a 1TB hard drive connected to the router so we can have central access from multiple computers. We've done that by plugging a small hard drive into the USB port of the router, creating a cheap NAS. The old TP_Link has only a USB 2.0 port while this Linksys has a USB 3.0 port which is a big improvement, being 10 times faster. This is huge for us. It will provide faster access for all files, and much faster backup to that drive.So the bottom line for us is, in most cases around our house, we will have faster download speeds, and better signal strength, with the new Linksys. Also we will have much faster access to the data on the hard drive connected to the router.I would guess if you have AC mode WiFi devices you'd be quite happy to have this router. Sorry I could not do any tests on that mode. For any devices we buy in the future I'll be looking for those with the AC WiFi feature.I also like the Guest WiFi account which gives my guests access to the internet, but not to our home network. It is password protected so not just anyone can use it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KWHPLRBCHCJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MIBLSA#wasThisHelpful","R2KWHPLRBCHCJN","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's not really possible to report on the long term behavior yet, but there are certainly things to excite me about these Eneloop batteries. I had heard the name Eneloop for quite a while but had not looked into them. CostCo was offering a package with 12 batteries and a charger so we picked that package up to give Eneloop a try.I hate batteries, always have. They are expensive, and drain much too quickly. For a few years we had tried a variety of AAA and AA batteries which worked okay but never as well as regular Alkaline batteries. They lost charge while sitting on the shelf, and drained very quickly.When we came home from CostCo I decided to see what other users said about Eneloop. Well other than a few who had apparently received a few bad batteries the general user review was very positive. They said these batteries last as long as Alkalines, had a long charge shelf life, and could be recharged many times. I was so pleased at the promise of these batteries I ordered  quite a few AA and AAA Eneloop batteries.Some reviewers complained the batteries did not come fully charged. I tried putting a few in a flashlight and they worked just fine. But I am putting all of them through the charger, and they all need about 20-30 minutes of charging before the charger indicates they are 100% charged. I don't care. I wouldn't have cared if they were 0% charged to begin with. Assuming they will last many years I'll be charging them many times so one more time doesn't seem like a problem for me.I will be using the Eneloop exclusively over the next few weeks and will report back here to indicate how these batteries have done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNL7KI9EQ0EQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQ2NA68#wasThisHelpful","RNL7KI9EQ0EQP","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The closet pulls in three bedrooms had all become scratched and blemished over their 17 years. Popping the old ones off was easy as they were tension mounted only. When I inserted these they wouldn't stay in until I drove nails trough the supplied nail holes. So they were the correct fit but just a little different design than the old ones.

"Oct 10, UpdateThe cushion is leaking air. I've had to blow it up twice last night. Today when I sat on it I had to blow it up again. For me this is the kiss of death. I'm reducing the review to one star and I'm going to toss it in the trash.Oct 9, 2015 UpdateI've found two negative things. 1) I can't sit on it for more than an hour without it becoming uncomfortable. I've found if I sit on the smooth bottom it is a bit more comfortable.  2) It doesn't breathe like a cloth covered cushion so my but feels wet after I've been sitting on it for a while then stand up. I'm reducing by one star.I've let out most of the air so it is almost flat now. I'm sure that defeats the purpose of the cushion but it is much more comfortable this way.Original Review:I can certainly use some body toning as I am overweight. Also I tend to sit in front of my computer, on a rather hard chair, for 3 to 5 hours per night . This cushion seemed to be a good solution for both issues. I only have been sitting on it for a short time but I admit it is keeping me moving to sit on it which has to be good for my torso. Also it is much more comfortable to sit on than the chair with two thin cushions I've been using for over a year.I've also had sciatic nerve problems in my left leg for 4 years. I'm hoping this cushion will exert less pressure on the leg which might relieve the pain.I will have to give this a week or so at which time I'll report back here.There was no evidence of the little inflator tool in the package. I already have a couple of those though.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15Q4EECJ32YBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0112RKD56#wasThisHelpful","R15Q4EECJ32YBI","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update Sept 30, 2015I used this projector for about 6 hours today. I am pretty pleased with it. The video is bright, sharp, high definition, and the color reproduction is very good.I was able to use a portable Bluetooth speaker for sound connected to my laptop, rather than the not too bad speaker of the projector. This feature depends on the capability of your laptop.In my original review I had a paragraph about the projector fan noise level. It is pretty hard to describe the volume of a sound so I thought I'd use my smartphone app which measures sound level in dB's. I measured the sound in the 10' x 10' room with the door closed so it was pretty quiet. There were no other sources of sound, such as my laptop which was turned off for this exercise. I took these measurements at 3 feet in back of the projector.  Room with the projector turned off = 30 dB (very quiet)  Room with the projector turned on = 55 dBOne table I found on-line indicated conversational speech is about 60-65 dB, a whisper at 30 dB, and a refrigerator at 50 dB. One site suggested ""comfortable hearing levels"" were below 60dBOf course I don't know how accurate my smartphone is as a dB meter but this should give an idea of the relative noise.Original Review:This projector is going straight to our private school once I've used it for a week or so. There it will be used five days per week and the school may have some more feedback that I will then share.Once unpacked I connected the projector to my laptop using an HDMI cable. I started a youtube video, switched the projector on, and immediately the sound of the video was already coming out of the projector's speaker. I pushed the Source Search button on the projector and it took three seconds to find the video stream on the HDMI input. So within less than 30 seconds after powering up I was watching the youtube video output from the projector. Having used many video projectors over the years this was by far the easiest set-up I've ever encountered. The settings on your own laptop my require some things that were automatic on my laptop.These projectors put out a lot of heat, almost all due to the lamp, and that heat has to be carried out of the projector so high volume fans are necessary. Fan noise of these projectors can often be too loud. Many times these projectors are set up on tables in the middle of a classroom or conference room where the noise is in the worst possible place; right in the middle of the viewing audience. When I first turned the VS340 in the fan noise was apparent but really not too loud. There is a low whine from the fan, the rest of the noise is the fan blade and air flow. I doubt if the designers could reduce the noise much at this point. Once the sound from the youtube video (at half volume on the projector settings) came on, the  noise from the fan was no big deal. The fan noise certainly would not cause a presenter/teacher to raise their voice.The speaker of the projector is on the rear which seems practical. How many times have you seen one of these in use where the presenter/teacher is in the front of the room and the projector is near them. Also the fan output is on the front, so opposite side away from the speaker. Overall I thought this was a smart design as far as fan noise and speaker output is concerned.The video image was bright at the default 50% setting, and it was pleasantly bright with daylight streaming into the room. Cranking the brightness up provided a very nice picture which I'm sure will be suitable for the classroom where it will be used. There are brightness and contrast settings in the menu. Color reproduction at the default settings was a replica of what was being shown on my laptop screen.A simple knob above the lens is used to focus the image.Behind the focus control is a zoom control. I was disappointed in the range of zoom which had a range of 56"" to 67"" in width when the projector was about eight feet from the wall. There is also a digital zoom in the menu system, but that is better used for situations where the video image does not fill the window of the projected video.Keystone controls are on top of the projector. The keystone adjustment is in small enough steps you will be able to adjust the image to a fairly exact rectangle shape. The projector has automatic keystone which seemed to work well as I tipped the projector up, but not so well when tipped down. In any case you have the manual keystone control.All projector controls can be adjusted from the top of the projector, or from the remote. The menu system is very easy to understand and use. I found the simple controls on the top of the projector to be a bit easier to use than the remote because the remote has quite a few more keys and some that required me to look in the user manual for the intended function (I had never heard of an MHL Device). Ignoring the special keys on the remote though it too is easy to use.By the way the 255 page user manual comes on the included disk. There is no paper copy of the manual shipped with the product. The good news is if you want to know more right now, before you buy, you can easily find the Epson VS340 user manual in PDF form online on the Epson web site. The manual indicates there is a ""Wireless"" option available to allow this projector to be used wireless over a LAN network. This projector has many more features than I've outlined here. Check the manual to see if this projector has the specific features you need or want.Without a manual or much effort at all you just plug this in, connect it up, and it's ready for use. I believe the way I use it is likely the way 95% of buyers will use it, connected to a laptop with an HDMI cable.On the remote is a button labeled ""Pointer"" which switches on or off a small arrow over the video image. You then use the rocker keys to move the arrow around. I suppose that would be useful in come cases but I'd rather have a laser pointer that would move with my hand. There are no ""Pointer"" controls on the top of the projector. In the menu system there is an option to change the shape of the pointer. One advantage of the Epson ""Pointer"" is students won't be shining a laser beam in each other's eyes.There is no carry handle on the projector. So it is more likely a two handed job to carry the VS340. A handle would have been nice but this projector will likely be carried in a box along with the cables and remote.In the past the lamps of this type of projector might last 100 hours or less, and they were expensive to replace. Epson suggests this lamp will last 10,000 hours; likely as long as the projector itself. This is a welcome improvement. However I looked up the replacement lamps which are only about $80. This projector uses what Epson calls 3LCD light source which is solid state so, while they do output heat, they are much cooler than the older lamps. A big advantage, other than long life, to the LCD lights is they do not require the fan to run for a long time after you power the projector down.A nice feature is provided with the lens cover. The lens of this projector does not protrude outside the body of the projector. There is a slide-over lens cover to protect the lens. If you slide the cover closed while the projector is operating the LCD light is turned off and the projector goes into a stand-by mode. It comes out of stand-by, back into full operation, as soon as you slide the cover open.There are other less expensive projectors on the market, but if you match price and display brightness (expressed in Lumens) most of this quality and brightness would be priced higher than the VS340.I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PD8G9HXZK6X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119FYOSI#wasThisHelpful","R1PD8G9HXZK6X9","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We just installed this faucet today. So far I like it a lot. The finish is exactly what we were looking for. The stainless steel should hold up for a long time. It isn't shiny like chrome so it won't show water marks easily. The magnetic spray head is really nice. Our previous faucet was  pull-out but it wouldn't say in place when it was retracted. It drooped and didn't look nice.My favorite feature is one that other people don't like. That is this faucet does not automatically return to stream mode when it it turned off then back on. I searched for a faucet that didn't do that. I like to use spray mode most of the time. It really irritated me that I couldn't get our previous faucet to stay in spray mode. The way this Delta works is there is a switch on the spray head for stream or spray. Turning the faucet off and on doesn't alter the switch setting.I cleaned up the dishes after dinner this evening. I really liked the extra height of the faucet because I didn't have to manipulate the larger pan under the faucet, it was tall enough to make that operation easy. Also the arm of the faucet swivels easily; something our previous faucet resisted.Installation was relatively easy. We have an advantage of our sink being installed on an angle in the corner of the counter top. That means there is a large area for my hands to fit where the faucet works are installed. Sinks that are up against a wall don't offer much space. The good news is Delta supplied a neat plastic wrench which helped with the most difficult part - that being running a nut up several inches under the sink to secure the faucet in place.I was a little concerned about the height of this faucet, easily twice the height of the one it replaced. Before ordering it I stood by the sink with a tape measure in hand trying to visualize what it would look like. My fears were for naught. The faucet looks great, especially against the backdrop of the potted plants behind it. I'll post a couple of photos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9T47MGXXXCJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A39FSAK#wasThisHelpful","R9T47MGXXXCJP","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"October 11, 2015I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 3 because the cable, right where the end plug is, has lost connection. They are less than two months old. I can move the wire around to make it work but it is intermittent. This may be due to my son's habit of playing with the cord, wrapping around his fingers, etc. Or it may be due to poor design or quality. I'm not sure. If it failed because my son was playing with the cord then perhaps these won't work with us. We are headed on vacation in three weeks so I just ordered another pair of headphones.Remembering that our son used the Kidz Gear headset for years before they broke I'm switching back to Kidz Gear. When the Kidz Gear (two pair) broke it was the volume control in the cord that went bad. The new Kidz Gear headphones no longer have a volume control in the cord. I just ordered another Kidz Gear headset.Original ReviewGood headphones for the price. The best thing I can say about these is my five-year-old likes them. They sound good, fit good, and I'm hoping the no tangle cord lives up to it's name.We had purchased two of the Kidz Gear headphones. The first pair lasted about two years, and the second about 18 months. That is pretty good service for a headset that is used often by a child, but... Both Kidz Gear headsets had to be tossed out due to the volume control in the cord which ceased to work. From what I can see Kidz Gear seems to have eliminated the volume control from their latest offering so they must have had too many complaints. However these Sentey were quite a bit less expensive so I thought we'd give them a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRCMZ4UE35FPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMVBQWU#wasThisHelpful","RRCMZ4UE35FPV","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sept 2, 2015 UpdateI've attached two additional photos. One shows the 1.250 two sided printouts. The other shows the ink level after printing those 1,250 pages. Since they are printed on both sides consider that this is the equivalent of 2,500 single sided printouts. It looks to me that about 10% of the ink which would scale to 25,000 pages until the ink runs out. I'm a believer.When we need a printer I will definitely consider one of the Epson EcoTank printers such as the 4500 or 4550.Original Review:This is a great printer. So fast! I print a lot of things for our church. The first thing I assigned to this printer queue was 200 two sided bulletin inserts. I was quite surprised at how fast the pages started spitting out of the machine; even duplex printing was quite rapid. The prints are crisp and look very good.You should have two people to un-box and lift this printer onto the place it will be used as it is heavy. Pulling off all of the blue packing tape, loading the ink, and loading the paper took about 15 minutes. Then the printer did some automatic setup which took another 12 minutes. The ink is actually quite easy to install. I have no idea how the printer gets the ink out of the ink bag, but then I really don't care. What I do care about is the quality of the printout and the cost of ink. In both cases this printer is a winner.I set the printer up using WiFi which was quick and easy. I used the push button method which means pushing a small button on my router, then selecting that mode on the printer. It took less than two minutes.I stuck the included disk in my computer DVD reader. The whole software setup took about 10-15 minutes (I walked away so it my have been quicker if I was present to answer questions). Then after about an hour it automatically searched for and downloaded some more software and updated drivers.I couldn't fit a whole ream of paper in one drawer, so I put the rest of it in the second drawer. My guess is it will hold about 800 sheets in the two drawers, which is really great. Tons of ink plus tons of paper means I won't have to service the printer often.Printing:Printing simply just worked. With three printers in the house I just selected the WF-R4640, and sent my duplex 200 bulletin insert job to the printer. It started printing within a few seconds after I pushed the Print button on my computer screen. I didn't time how long it took to print all 200 double sided sheets but it was something on the order of 20 minutes or so. It would have taken two hours on my Canon printer.There isn't too much more I can say about the printing feature except it is really fast, and the resulting printout is very very good. Knowing I have an enormous ink supply really makes me want to print a lot more often in color. I've fallen into the habit of printing a lot of things in grey-scale to save color ink.Scanning:I have another Epson printer and it will scan but it was a pain to use. In fact I never could get the little Epson XP-420 to scan from the front panel and had to do it from the computer. Then the window used for scanning from the computer would close after every scan operation. I finally gave up and use my Canon for scanning.The WF-R4640 scan has lots of options including scanning to email, the cloud, FTP, and more, but I couldn't find an option to scan to my computer. Huh? Thats the main thing I want to do with my scans. Again I had to revert to using my computer to execute a scan as I could not figure out any way to scan from the front panel of the printer and send the image to my computer. If I had to scan several things I could put them in the document feeder and scan all of them easily. But if I was scanning pages out of a book I'd have to walk back and forth between the printer and my computer.One mode is to scan to a thumb drive which I did. It worked fine but was not ideal. I could also display the contents of the thumb drive on the printer LCD screen.One thing I wanted to check was how many small photos I could lay on the platen and have the WF-R4640 auto crop them each into their own .JPG file. However I could not find any way to do that at all. It isn't a matter of how many photos, rather it's a matter of no auto crop being available at all. I was really hoping for a faster, better, scan than my Canon. Finally after much poking around I stumbled on the Thumbnail tab in the Scan Preview window which was smart enough to discover there were four photos on the platen.  It worked but was far from obvious.Of course scanning multiple photos isn't a normal office need. I was hoping to combine all of my print, scan, and copy jobs into this one printer to take advantage of the faster speed. There is some good news. The scan results were superb. I scanned at 600dpi and the resulting images were exactly the same colors, brightness, and sharpness of the original photos. In fact the results were better than my flatbed scanner. Really the best I've seen and I've scanned a lot of photos.CopyMy only complaint about copy and scan is the lid (which is also the automatic document feeder) over the platen doesn't have a hinge mechanism that holds the lid in the open position. I have to lift it (it isn't heavy) all the way up until it is about 95-100 degrees from it's horizontal position for it to stay open. There is nothing to keep the lid from slamming down either; no hinge mechanism that will act like a shock absorber. It's not bad but my other printers do have such a mechanism. I'll have to be more careful with this one.Copy has a set of features. Of course you can place a single sheet on the platen to copy it, or you can stick one or more sheets into the document feeder. The feeder works perfectly, picking up one sheet at a time as it should. The document feeder passes a sheet over a window which scans the document in before printing it. The platen on the other hand moves the scan bar under the stationary document. No big surprise here.Copy quality is excellent. As with most copiers these days it isn't easy to determine which was the original and which is the copy. The quality is that good.Here is the one thing that this printer simply can't do; border-less photo printing. There is a thin line of un-printed white all around the edge.Do you want to lay a book on the platen to copy something? Well certainly you can open the top and lay the book on the platen. But if you want to close the top over the book it had better be a thin book. The top (which is the auto feeder) only expands about 1/2"". My Canon expands more than twice that height.FaxI couldn't test the Fax feature. To tell the truth I haven't had to fax anything in over 4 years. Every time someone tells me they are going to FAX me something I just ask if they could email it instead. They always can and do. Then I print the form that was mailed to me, fill it out, sign it, scan it back in and email it back. We don't even have a land-line.NoiseThis isn't a quite printer. It isn't a particularly noisy printer either. The printer makes the usual noise picking up a sheet of paper to print on, then there is the relatively quiet noise of the print head going back and forth. I wouldn't want my desk to be sitting next to this printer if it is to be used by an office staff all day.There is a Quiet Mode for printing but I didn't find one for scanning or copying. I also didn't notice much of a difference between Quiet mode On or Off.Touch ScreenAs neither of my other printers is touch screen it took me a few moments to recognize this one was. The strange thing is some screens have a back arrow to go back one screen, while in other cases you have to depend on the physical back button next to the screen.The menu system isn't particularly easy to use. I found this also to be true of my other Epson printer. Part of the problem is this printer has a ton of options, all of which make sense for their respective operations. The other part is the menus sometimes make perfect sense, while other times I had to walk back to the computer to read the user manual. (I am a very experienced user)The one thing that kept getting my attention as I tried out many of this printer's functions is how fast it is. It didn't matter if I was printing an 8x10"" sheet of paper or a 4x6"" color print; the thing is just noticeably fast.Conclusion...This is a very nice printer. If I focus myself on the fact that this is intended for a small office I can overlook the photo shortcomings. For an office this is very fast, very practical, very cost effective, and low maintenance. The print/copy/scan quality is top notch.Now that I have had it in hand and understand that it's strengths are clearly small office oriented, and it won't do everything that I want it to do for a home printer, I will be seeking a small office to donate it. It will go either to our private school, a local homeless organization, or my church. If I donate it to our church I'll be able to do the printouts that are my volunteer job for the church, I'll just have to do them at church instead of at home.I'm including a series of photos I took as I set the printer up for use. You'll see 1) The size of the box it cam in. 2) some of the blue tape that had to be removed. 3) The size of the printer next to my 20oz water bottle 4) Opening the black ink compartment. 5) Pushing the release to open the black ink receiver 6) The black ink receiver open 7) black ink bag 8) ink bag in place 9) latching the black ink 10) same deal for the color ink bags 11) the business side of an ink bag 12) color ink bags installed 13) the printer auto setup screen 14) My attempt at making a copy of a 4x6"" photo 15) the rear (3rd) paper tray with a sheet of 4x6"" photo paper.I will donate this printer but the next time I need to buy a printer it will be one of these bag ink types. I hate spending $20-$50 for a 1/2 shot glass of ink.I highly recommend this printer for a small office. The printer itself is expensive but then it is a serious printer with many features and blazing speed. The ink bags will cost $100-$200 each but they should last 20,000 copies each so will save tons of money on ink.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z0JKCJN2G69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JFF0#wasThisHelpful","R1Z0JKCJN2G69","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"September 13, 2015 UpdateMy 5 year old son was very excited about the LeapReader. He brought it with him everywhere, even in the car on the way to school and back. He used it for about five days, then put it down and lost interest in it. I even bought theLeapFrog LeapReader Learn to Read, Volume 1 set but he didn't get interested in those books, even after I tried to spend time with him. It seems the novelty of touching words and having the LeapReader wore off.I still think this is a great product, but it is a learning tool rather than a game. He is in a good private kindergarten five hours a day and I think that is simply enough for him. When he gets home he wants to play.Original ReviewI have been quite positive on the quality of LeapPad products over the past couple of years, at the same time being very critical of the premium prices they ask for their apps/games. In my opinion the LeapReader may be the positive exception.Much of the LeapFrog system including the software for the various tablets are WAY too expensive for what they provide. We simply do not buy titles because they are so darn expensive. This LeapPreader and the books are a different story.First the pen itself is nicely priced in the $50 range. It has a built in battery (too bad it isn't user replaceable though), speaker, microphone jack, Home, Forward, Back, Play/Pause, and power buttons. It has something on the order of several hundred megabytes of storage which is a lot for audio only.We home schooled our three children all they way from K-12. Teaching them to read was the single most important skill we could have taught them. All other educational skills have as their foundation good reading capacity. There are many reader teaching tools on the market, this is just one of them so don't think it is head and shoulders above some others. But for what it is it is pretty good.Paying $25 for some of the titles on a LeapPad is pretty steep, especially for the limited learning many of them provide. But Paying $14 for the Paw Patrol book with audio included that teaches a child to learn reading is quite another thing. Next I will be ordering the six volume set Learn To Read Volume 1 for under $18 total.My five-year-old learned to start to read in pre-schol, now he's just started kindergarten. He already can sound out many words and is rapidly going down the path of reading quite well. Still he can benefit from the Learn To Read Volume 1 set.My only concern is the LeapReader is a mix of Whole Word and Phonics. Touch a word in the book with the pen and the word is spoken. By touching the yellow diamond the tool switches into a sound-it-out mode. But kids can ignore that mode. Frankly what kids want to do is have the story told to them and listening to the phonics isn't very much fun. So if they skip the phonics approach all they are getting is the While Word teaching style.Whole Word is quite controversial. We first started home schooling our children when we learned the public schools in California were teaching Whole Word. At that time we pulled our daughter out of first grade and taught her to read using phonics. In 2005 the country of Australia, ""endorsed the teaching of synthetic phonics, and discredited the whole language approach."" It is a system we were not pleased with.Whole Word means the child learns to recognize what a word is simply by seeing the word and learning it by sight. In the 1970's the State of California taught early grades to sight read about 1,000 words but those children were doomed when they had to move on to other words because they had no basis for sounding-them-out (phonics). The grades of thos students suffered when they hit Jr High and High School. Many of them had to be taught to read using phonics at that late date. It still remains controversial to this day. We do not endorse or encourage whole word teaching methods. In time we all do read that way, in the beginning of reading it does not equip children properly. Since our child attends a very good private school that teaches phonics, and we can lean towards the phonics tools available on the LeapReader we feel we can proceed with this utility.This brings up an important aspect of the entire LeapFrog ecosystem. The way LeapFrog tools are created, with spoken instructions, children can happily go off and user their LeapPad or LeapReader all by themselves. As a baby-sitting tool this is great but it leaves the child to explore on their own, perhaps bypassing some of the more important parts of the tools you spent so much money on. We do allow our child to play with the tools by himself but we make certain to also sit with him to encourage him to work through the proper steps of learning with the LeapFrog products. They are both a blessing and a curse.So as we, as a family, step into using the LeapFrog LeapReader we are pleased and encouraged to provide our son with this aid to supplement what the school is teaching. It will be interesting to see how long he continues to use the LeapReader. He only sticks with the LeapPad for a short time, then gets bored with it.Of all of the LeapFrog products we feel this is the best tool they have produced. We tried the iMagicCard system but it was mostly a gimic and we won't be purchasing any of those titles again. On the other hand we may very well purchase a number of the LeapReader products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Q2KPAS3UQT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1P5YY#wasThisHelpful","R12Q2KPAS3UQT1","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"October 1, 2015Today I cleaned a whole 10' x 10' room without having to refill the cleaning solution tank, or emptying the collection tank. I ran the cleaner on the Express Clean mode in a room that did not have a very soiled carpet. The carpet was pretty clean when I started, and perhaps just a little more clean when I finished. While it was nice not to have to deal with the tanks several times I really don't think the express mode cleans very well. I think the only realistic mode is the Deep Cleaning mode.August 24, 2015As promised here are my comments after doing some carpet cleaning today. I cleaned about 180 square feet of high traffic area in our house.The Bissell 1548 worked fine, however my concerns were warranted. The fresh water tank, and especially the dirty water collection are too small. Not unlike other home carpet cleaning systems. I found that on the Deep Cleaning setting, following the instructions to make two ""wet"" passes and two vacuum passes, I had to refill the clean tank, and empty the dirty water tank, every 40-50 square feet. To me this is annoying. The back and forth to the sink simply happens way too often.The collection tank is small to begin with. Then the automatic shut off system turns it off when the tank is less than 1/2 full. I will include a photo.If you don't mind changing the water four times in a smaller than 15 square foot room then you may be pleased with the Bissell 1548.I tried it on the Express Clean mode (much less cleaning solution applied) which would seem to last through a whole room, but I didn't think that did a good job of cleaning. Bissell recommends using the Deep Cleaning mode.I can say one very positive thing about the Bissell 1548; the dual brush system works very well. I'm comparing it to the 7 year old Hoover F5880 we have. That Hoover's brushes were simply to little and too soft to do much scrubbing.Other than the brushes I don't see anything that sets this product apart from other home carpet cleaners.Now a few comparison comments between this Bissell and our old Hoover. Both seem to do an equally good job at cleaning the carpet and depositing dark dirty water in the collection tank.- The old Hoover has better vacuum suction. It returns more water from the carpet than the Bissell.- The old Hoover has a large cap for the clean water tank. Invert the cap, fill it with cleaning product, and dump it into the tank. This is easier than the Bissell which requires me to fill the hot water to a fill line (hard to tell when there is a foam in that tank), then fill to a second line with solution.- It is easier to rinse the dirty water tank of the Hoover than the Bissell.- The Bissell brush system is far superior to the old Hoover system.- The overflow shut-off system for the dirty water tank works much better in the Bissell than the old Hoover.I recommend this Bissell for those who don't mind exchanging water often. Still I find very little, other than the brushes, to differentiate this from other systems on the market. The Hoover Power Scrub Deluxe Carpet Washer, FH50150 is less expensive and receives high reviews on Amazon.com.As for me I intend to donate my old Hoover, and this Bissell, to my offspring for their homes. I will be ordering a Bissell BISSELL Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine Professional Grade Carpet Cleaner, 86T3/86T3Q for twice the price but way over twice the tank sizes.Original ReviewFirst Impressions after unpacking, assembling, and reading the operating instructions.Pros:1) Easy to assemble.2) The tanks are easy to remove and reinstall.3) I really like the two rotating brushes - this was a key point for me selecting this product.4) Not that this is all that important but it is a nice looking machine.5) Long power cord.6) It has a bare floor mode7) Hose and fittings to do stairs and furniture, or car floors and upholstery.8) Light weightCons:1) The fresh water supply is only one gallon.2) The dirty water tank looks to be about one gallon too but the ""fill"" line is much lower and the dirty water tank will shut off when it is less than half full. There is a float in the dirty water tank that will shut off dirty water collection when the tank reaches a very low line on the tank. Having to change the clean and dirty water tanks was one of my big complaints about our old rug cleaner. I hope this is better than it looks.I intend to clean some carpets tomorrow and will return with a report on that outcome.One thing I was curious about was this is called a ProHeat cleaner so I assumed it had some sort of built in heating system to keep the water hot. It does show HeatWave Technology. I guess you have to trust it because there is nothing that is visible to the eye related to heating the water. There is no switch to turn the heater on or off. There is no ""warm up time"" specified in the manual.Amazon encourages us to compare products. The carpet cleaner we've owned for several years is a Hoover F5880 SteamVac Ultra. I must say that product produces no ""steam"" so it too seems to be a bit of false advertising to me.There are three things that bother me about our old Hoover.1) The four soft small brushes on the bottom rotate side-by-side but there is a small gap between them. I've never felt they offered much scrubbing action. They are like four 3"" disks with a soft brush around the edge of each disk laying flat on the carpet and rotating.2) Both the fill tank and the dirty water tank are small. The clean water tank is 1 gallon (same as this Bissell) and the dirty water tank is perhaps also 1 gallon. However ""full"" means quite a bit less than full for the dirty water tank.3) There is a ""float disk"" that shuts off collection of dirty water when the dirty water tank is full (or less than 1/2 full). The float disk will rise just based on the foam in the dirt water (I'm always careful to buy the carpet cleaner marked ""low suds or low foam). Also the float disk will rise and shut the collection of dirty water off if I move the machine a bit too abruptly which can jostle the float disk. Then I have to turn the machine off and wait for the float disk to drop before I can restart.All of this means the Hoover carpet cleaner will clean far less of a room's carpet and I have to shut down to refill the fresh water tank, and empty the dirty water tank. I just did an 11' x 11' room last week and had to fill and empty the tanks FOUR times for that rather small carpet. Very annoying. I would say it takes me twice as long as it would with a machine with larger tanks, and a properly operating dirty water shut off system.The amazing thing is I've been so unhappy with the Hoover that I researched carpet cleaners and actually thought I had ordered the Bissell Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine ($400). I then checked my Amazon Vine (free products to review) queue and wonder of wonders this Bissell was there for the asking. I went back to see if I could cancel my Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine but in fact I had not hit the last button to order it so it was not actually on order. Wonderful. This Bissell 1548 ProHeat 2X Revolution has the same brush system as Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine so I thought I'd struck it rich.At this point I have the new Bissell with much better brushes, but it seems the tank size issue I've had with the Hoover may still be the same. In fact other than the brushes the Bissell 1548 and the Hoover F5880 seem to be rather equivalent machines. It is entirely possible that I will try this new Bissell 1548, give it to one of my children for their home, and order Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine when all is said and done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AQOVTLKYYN8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C9A5K#wasThisHelpful","R1AQOVTLKYYN8A","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At Last!I recently purchased an Echo clip for my helmet. I was tired of threading the strap through the D rings. The Echo worked and was strong, but it was not easy to align the two parts to clip them together, nor was it easy to unlatch. As I used the Echo, spending a few moments trying to figure feel if the parts were aligned properly, I kept wondering if I might have threaded the D rings quicker than using the Echo. I actually had it misaligned once and it seemed to click in place. When I went to take the helmet off I couldn't get the Echo unlatched because it wasn't properly latched in the first place.This RydeWear is just the opposite. It is easy to install, easy to latch and unlatch.

"For about $2.80 each these are pretty decent glasses. I normally buy my reading glasses at CostCo but they continuously change the style they have on hand for purchase. I was looking for half-eye style frames and couldn't find them. This 5-Pack was just what I was looking for.These glasses are all steel frame, no springs on the ear piece. They can be bent to suit. All heads are not shaped the same so I do find it convenient to be able to bend the glasses to fit my self. That is why I prefer steel frames and ear pieces rather than plastic. The nose pieces are large and soft. Overall I like the fit.I ordered, and received, 2.00 strength. The only flaw I can see is at the very top of the lens, adjacent to the top frame, there is a distortion in the plastic lens. It isn't very wide so it doesn't bother me.They are so cheap if I scratch a lens I can just toss it in the trash. I believe these will hold up quite well. Cheap reading glasses tend to last between six months and a year for me. But that is the reason for taking one star off.I do recommend these glasses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GQ4R5MZD85A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHWZHBK#wasThisHelpful","R32GQ4R5MZD85A","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagicard is a software process that uses a camera to pick up a code from cards supplied with the game. The game can run on any LeapPad because it is not hardware dependent, other than the need for a camera which to my knowledge all LeapPads have. There is nothing magic about the cards, they are just cards like a deck of playing cards, but thicker. The white stripe around the edge with notches, is what the software reads.There are a few games within the Teenage Mutant Ninja app that use the cards. For example asks the child to provide two numbers that add up to a sum number such as #X + #Y = 5. Some of the TMNT cards have numbers in the upper right hand corner. The child is to locate two cards that sum to the value 5. For example 0+5, 1+4, or 2+3. They locate two cards, point the camera at the cards one at a time, then hit a Checkmark to validate their answer. This is a little ahead of my five year old. It could also have been accomplished by putting a few numbers on the screen and asking the child to tap on the numbers.BBP gave a good 4 star review with a lot more details so I won't attempt to duplicate all of that.Our five year old (I've had six kids) is pretty smart for his age. Capable in many ways. He regularly whips me at a game of concentration, matching pairs of 48 cards laid face down on a table. His vocabulary and comprehension is well beyond his 5 1/2 years. This game is rated for ages 5-8 but I think 5 is a stretch. He is able to play all other LeapPad games without assistance. He could not use more than 40% of this app by himself.In general I find nothing very exciting about the Imagicard part of the software. It could have been left out and accomplished other ways without the cards and camera. It is a bit novel though and I expect it will hold my son's interest for a day or two.I also agree with most of the other reviewers that cards will get lost, spread all over the house, bent, and thrown away inadvertently. I've already found myself collecting cards and putting them back into the tin they came in.As I said there are a few games within the TMNT app. One of them deals with the TMNT characters and their characteristics. You have to have a well working knowledge of the TMNT characters to begin to play that game. We never let our children watch Teen Age Mutant Ninja Turtles because of the violence in their TV shows. So our children can't answer the trivia questions. I thought the app would be void of the violence, unlike the TV, show. Even though he couldn't watch the show he was still interested in TMNT I didn't know he would have to have such a detailed knowledge of the Turtles to play that aspect of the app.It seems LeapFrog got carried away with their new found ability to use the camera to scan an image on the cards and make something happen in the app. I rather doubt that any other implementation of the Imagicard process, in another app, will be any more interesting than this one. At $25 it is hugely expensive too. At $5 this might be more interesting as a short term novelty.I'm being generous by giving it three start, perhaps it only rates two.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W4Q0K0EUL3IN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1P4TA#wasThisHelpful","R3W4Q0K0EUL3IN","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find it hard to decide how many stars to give the Platinum.On one hand it is a very sturdy product, kid friendly, some parental controls. So on the physical attributes I would give it five stars. I also don't think $100+ is out of line considering it has a 7"" screen, 8GB of memory, two cameras, and it can play MP3 music and shoot video. But the previous product, the Ultra, is available for well under $100. I'm tempted to take a star off for the high price of the Platinum which isn't any better than the Ultra. There's something strange about this company. They take an existing product, repackage it a little, give it a new name, and bump the price way up. We had a LeapPad 2 then got a LeapPad Glo; same product repackaged. You'd think they would follow the general market of electronic devices and newer products would be less expensive.The Platinum is a slightly different shape, more rounded, whereas the Ultra is more of a rectangle. The Platinum diffidently weights less at 19.3 oz. The Ultra weighed 22.9 oz. The weight difference may be the best or only reason to choose the Platinum over the Ultra - if the prices were equal. The lighter weight will be much appreciated by the little ones that have to hold it.I have a smartphone (Nokia Lumia 635) I purchased for $70 (full price). It has a 5"" screen, much faster quad processor, and there are over 500,000 apps available for it. Tons of the apps are free, another huge quantity are $0.99, and the really expensive ones are about $5. This is what I have to compare with the LeapFrog devices. Based on that phone, which has a user replaceable battery and a microSD card slot, the phone is a much better buy. In fact buying one of those for my five year old may make perfect sense. The phone also has a thing called ""Kids Corner"" which protects them from getting onto the internet, changing the phone setup, or making purchases.On the other hand it is basically a repackaged LeapPad Ultra. We now have both an Ultra and the Platinum. I ran them side by side and couldn't find any reason to spend the extra cost for the Platinum; they are pretty much identical with buttons moved around from one to the other. The memory is the same, screen is the same, speed of operation is the same, but the Ultra battery life is longer. Go figure.ONE STAR OFF FOR NON USER REPLACEABLE BATTERIESI despise built-in non user removable batteries. We also have a LeapFrog LeapPad Glo which has user replaceable batteries (an option we purchased), and you can run it off of 4 AA batteries in a pinch; very nice. I don't understand why LeapFrog would abandon the Glo battery design and build the battery into the Ultra and Platinum. All batteries deteriorate. Do you own a car? Have you ever had a 12V battery in your car last longer than about 5 years? From the moment batteries are manufactured they begin to deteriorate. Most built in lithium ion batteries will have lost between 20% and 50% of their charge capacity after two years. Even Apple publishes the schedule of how their iPhone batteries deteriorate over time. Lithium batteries also have the habit of some that simply die an early death, it could happen in a month or a couple of years. My iPod Touch 5th Gen battery only holds a charge for about 10 minutes - it was less than 2 years old when it went bad. The Platinum, for some reason I can't determine, is specified to have a shorter battery charge life than the Ultra. Huh? At least one star off for the built in battery and shorter operating time. When the Glo rechargable batteries die I can just buy new batteries and pop them in. What do I do with the Platinum when the battery dies?To tell you the truth my five-year-old tends to play with my smartphone or 9"" tablet (which I bought here on Amazon for $65, with a microSD card slot!) more than he does the LeapPad products. I think the main attraction of the LeapPad products is they are his own, rather than having to borrow one of my devices and get permission to use it.If you are ready to spend a ton of money on LeapFrog apps, and like this Platinum I suggest you buy a much less expensive Ultra/XDI.ONE STAR OFF FOR VERY EXPENSIVE APPSAcross the board these LeapFrog products have one huge marketing problem. The apps/games are very high priced. Many of the apps, the good ones at least, sell for about $25!!! Don't get me wrong the apps are quite good, but I can find very good games on my Android tablet for $0.99 to about $5. LeapFrog seems to have a marketing strategy to attach premium prices to their software and limit their market volume, instead of dropping the prices into a reasonable range and dramatically expanding their market. Yes we now have three LeapPad devices but it is rare for me to purchase an app because they are so darn expensive. One star off for high priced apps. Buy a LeapPad and then five or six apps and the app cost could easily exceed the price of the LeapPad.LeapFrog if you drop your app prices into the under $10 area I'll buy a lot of them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G48T8JQ31HS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1P6AM#wasThisHelpful","R3G48T8JQ31HS4","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's such a shame that this light was designed, likely prototyped, manufactured, shipped multiple times, installed, removed, and ended up in the trash. What a waste.Original ReviewThe title ""Super Bright"" should read ""Way Too Dim.""I should have trusted many reviews that said it would be dim. I thought the area where I wanted to install it is so dark it wouldn't take much light so it should be okay - Not! I think the 7 watt night light in our bathroom puts out more light than this thing.We have a deep sink in our laundry room. There are cabinets over the sink that create shadows making the sink area dark. There is no AC outlet in the area so this seemed like the perfect solution.It actually works fine. It is motion triggered as promised. It switched off in 15 seconds. I'll have to put a piece of black electrical tape on the sensor to narrow the field of view because it turns on when we just walk by.This light says ""50lm"" on the sticker on the back. Why they would design a light with 14 LEDs that collectively only output 50 lumens is beyond me.I can not recommend this product.

"Perfect. I normally buy my reading glasses at CostCo. But CostCo rotates the style of glasses so you don't always get the same thing from time to time. This time I didn't pay enough attention, too fixated on the strength and shape of the glasses, and didn't notice that the CostCo selection were all this light weight soft plastic material. The CostCo glasses don't have the bendable nose pieces, rather the nose part is molded into the plastic and they slip down my nose.Thes Gamma Ray brand glasses don't have spring loaded ear pieces, but they fit snug and don't slide around. From now on I'll be careful to select metal frame glasses that can be bent to better shape them to my face. The weight is certainly much more than the light weight CostCo glasses but to tell you the truth the weight just doesn't make a difference to me.I recommend these glasses and will buy them again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNXIZ5O8E0KQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1IGXV6#wasThisHelpful","RNXIZ5O8E0KQJ","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"August 15, 2015 UpdateI've now used the Sonicare for two mornings. I'm reducing my review from 4 stars to 2 stars. The Sonicare simply does not have enough power in the water stream off the tip, even when set to three pulses, to act as a flosser. I've also discovered that while I could use it away from a sink I'm better off to hang over the sink so water doesn't accumulate in my mouth which gets in the way of the flossing action. So portability isn't what I thought it would be.To be fair I did look up cordless Waterpik flossers and I see that they receive lower scores than the AC models. It seems when these manufacturers try to make something battery powered they have to give up too much in terms of the intended function. They simply can't produce a small, battery powered, yet powerful unit.I simply can not recommend this product. One of the many WaterPik products that has a base with an extendable tube and constant pulsing is a much better choice.Original Review:I accepted this free Vine product thinking we would use for our 5 year old son who hates to have us floss and brush his teeth. It didn't turn out well for him.- He hated the taste of the mouthwash that came with the Sonicare even though I just put in a few drops with the rest being water. Okay I emptied it and just used fresh water.- The instructions make it clear it is to be used with your mouth closed, pretty much killing the idea of using it on our son because we need his mouth open to see where we are pointing the business end of the product.So much for using it for our son. Next I will try it. I already use a Waterpik Waterflosser (about $90 today) and have for several years. In the Amazon guidelines they suggest comparing products so I will. The Sonicare is about $82 so pretty close in price.- The Waterpik provides a constant pulse whereas the Sonicare pulses one to three times then stops.- The Waterpik is AC operated whereas the Sonicare is rechargable in it's own special charging base.- The Waterpik has a small wand on the end of a spiral tube whereas the Sonicare is self contained and portable.- The Waterpik has a large reservoir appropriate for the constant flow of water. The Sonicare has a thumb sized reservoir appropriate for the intermittent pulses.- The Waterpik has a dial to select different strengths of the stream whereas the Sonicare has no adjustment.So they each have their pros and cons.Waterpik Pros- No battery to wear out or recharge- Constant pulse is (in my opinion) easier to use and perhaps does a better job.- The wand is light weight.- The tip of the wand can be rotated to reach different areas.- The strength of the stream can be adjusted with a knob marked 1 to 10Waterpik Cons- Due to the high volume of water flow it is pretty much necessary to hold my head over a sink while using it.Sonicare Pros- More portable. It is a self contained unit- Able to be used away from a sink due to the small amount of water/mouthwash used due to the pulsed operation.- It can be set to pulse once, twice, or three times until it shuts off for about 1 1/2 seconds- The unit will stop pulsing if you take your finger off the trigger. That allows for an even longer time between pulse bursts.- A single charge will last between 11 and 33 days depending on the pulse setting.- The self charging method is inductive so there are no metal contacts.- Simple to use charging stand. Just set the wand on the stand.Sonicare Cons- Anything with a built in battery will deteriorate over time. In two or three years this might not work well and you can't replace the battery.- The intermittent pulse method may not work as well as a constant pulse.- Lack of adjustment of the power of the pulses.- The unit is rather large to hold. I suspect it could have been designed smaller. I don't know why it had to be this large. It measures 6 1/2 inches long not counting the 3 inch tip. The length isn't too bad. The circumference is about 5 1/2"" in the center. I have large hands and I can not touch my thumb and forefinger when my hand is wrapped around the unit. This becomes an issue when the whole unit must be rotated to direct the end of the wand to different areas of the mouth. The wand itself does not rotate, you must rotate the whole Sonicare device.I do intend to try this for several days. I will return here to update this review.As of this moment I would recommend a Waterpick over the Sonicare HX8331/30. The pros outweigh the cons for me. Perhaps you might feel differently. Certainly the portability factor might be a big positive for some people.When reading the user reviews of other Sonicare floss devices I see they have been quite unreliable. Many failing within the first few months. This is a completely new device. Perhaps Philips has addressed the reliability issues and this one will be reliable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V8QWBC1NPV4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ67KBK#wasThisHelpful","R3V8QWBC1NPV4E","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"August 20, 2015 UpdateI'm going to reduce one star and have to agree with other reviewers on one point. Many buy these for running or other sport activities. They are, after all, advertised as SoundSport. I am not a runner but today I mowed the lawn which makes a lot of noise. So I used these Bose earphones. First, as I said in my original review below, they do not block ambient noise. I had to turn the volume up quite a bit to overcome the sound of the (electric) lawn mower. Then while simply walking around pushing the lawn mower one of the ear buds fell out.No question the sound produced by these earphones is superb. But if you are buying something for sports I'd look elsewhere.Original ReviewI use earphones for perhaps 3 to 4 hours every day. My choice for the past year or more has been the Apple (no I'm not a fanboy but just those earphones) EarPods. They have good sound and fit very comfortably in my ears. I've actually given away or thrown away almost all other earphones in my collection and mostly use the EarPods. I was skeptical about any other earphones. But when I saw these were from Bose I requested them.I don't know why they are called headphones by Bose. To me headphones denotes earphones attached to a device that goes over your head. To me these are earphones.These in-ear earphones were very nicely packaged. I guess if you have a name like Bose, with a premium price on the product, you must create this expensive packaging to convince people the product is superior, or to let them know they really are superior. I see these are priced well over $100 so they should be well packaged, and they better be good.How good anything sounds is subjective. What I think is good others might have issues with. All I can do is say how they sound to me, and they sound very good. As soon as I took them out of the package I immediately plugged them into my Samsung Galaxy S3, played one of my favorite tracks. I was very pleased with the sound. It was almost shocking how good they sounded. The same music that I had been listening to earlier seemed to have more sound, more instruments, clearer voices. These earphones seem to cover a wide spectrum of sound evenly, good base, good midrange, and good highs. The sound is bright but not brash. The base is good but not overpowering. Even when I turned the volume up too loudly these earphones didn't sound over-driven. Very nice.The cord mounted controller can be used to increase or decrease the sound, and to pause or play, skip forward or skip back, on my Samsung Galaxy S3. You can also answer a call by pushing the center button on the cord. A nice improvement for me personally as the Apple EarPod cord controller does not communicate with my S3. My only complaint about the SoundSport is the cord control is mounted too high, about 2"" too high in my opinion. There is a cord mounted clip that can be repositioned. The clip will keep the cord from swinging away from the body when leaning forward.These are sold as In-Ear which I find is partially true. I have in-ear earphones that I use in very noisy environments such as an airplane. They cut off external sound by sealing off the ear canal from ambient sound. These have a soft silicone protrusion that fits in the ear but they do not cut out ambient sound. So they are partially in-ear.The earphones are sold with three sizes of the silicone portion that fits into the ear. In addition to the protrusion there is a silicone loop that fits in the folds of the ear holding the earphones in place. The whole thing is very comfortable. The driver portion of the Bose SoundSport protrudes enough that they won't be comfortable for me to wear in bed and lay my head on either side on the pillow. The Apple EarPods are much better for use in bed as they are quite a bit smaller. Obviously the difference in sound quality between the EarPods and these SoundSport is significant.There is a very nice soft zippered round 3"" pouch included for storing the SoundSport earphones. The pouch has about a 2"" carabiner which is a nice touch.The best complement I can give for these earphones is they make me want to listen to more music. These are the best sounding earphones I've ever heard. They are out of my price range though, I'm an under $50 earphone buyer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SIDIZYG2OD3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RFPCC#wasThisHelpful","R3SIDIZYG2OD3J","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't looking for a fast card, I was looking for a microSD card that was 32GB and cheap. It is going into a very cheap 9"" tablet I just bought where high speed wasn't needed. This card surprised me. I paid only $11.99 for it on Amazon.com with free Prime shipping. Yet it tested to easily beat it's UHS-1 Class 10 minimum speed class requirement. So much the better.I did with this card what I do with all the memory cards I buy (and hard drives too). I ran a speed test on it using CrystalDiskMark 3.0.4 x64. The results were sequential read speed of 36.26 MB/s, and write speed of 15.75 MB/s. The packaging says Read speed up to 85 MB/s but that would be with a higher buss speed than I have. My interface is capable of up to 36.49 MB/s only. So this card may very well be capable of speeds faster than that which I can test. In any case it is fast, especially for the $11.99. It is also the least expensive (of the nine microSD cards I now own) per Gigabyte than I've ever paid for a microSD card, regardless of size or spec.I remember the early 1970's when we were waiting for semiconductor memory to fall to $0.01 per bit. The concept of a 1 GigaBit anything was beyond comprehension, and 1GB would have cost $10M which is pretty hard to swallow too. In the early 1970's I once paid (with company money) $7,500 for a memory card holding 288,000 bits of semiconductor memory, and that was a bargain as the price had recently been $15K. In the early 1980's I paid (with company money) $20,000 for 384 Mega Byte hard drive that took four strong men to carry into the building. This card only cost a ridiculous 37 cents per GagaBit, and if I drop it on the carpet I need a flashlight to find it.In many years of SD card use I've never had one fail so I expect this off-brand to be just as reliable. All of the non-volitle memory chips come from the same three factories around the world.Looking for a cheap but fast card? This might be the right one for you too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXFJ3MGMS8XYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9QONN6#wasThisHelpful","RXFJ3MGMS8XYT","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works perfect in our Prius. I plug this in, pair it with my 9"" tablet. Run the Torque app, and can diagnose the reason our Prius has dropped from 45-47 mpg average down to only 35 mpg average. There are knock-off Bluetooth OBD2 units on the market for about 1/2 the price of this one from BAFX. I didn't want to take the chance of wasting my money so I bought this one and I'm glad I did.The OBD2 scan tool has some lights but I didn't pay any attention to them. All I wanted was for this unit to interface with the ODB2 on our Prius and transmit that information to my 9"" tablet. The ""Torque"" app on my tablet does all of the real work by connecting up to this scan tool using Bluetooth.So far this tool has worked flawlessly. We leave it plugged in all of the time. Our ODB2 connector is under the dash and is located above the gas pedal. It is a bit long but it's not in the way and we don't notice it for bump into it.It was totally simple to use. I just plugged it in and it started working. It has stayed connected through Bluetooth without dropping the signal at all. All of the information that we set up on the Torque app is able to be delivered by this BAFX scan tool. I have no complaints.I highly recommend this BAFX tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29O4Z59XY4CCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NLQAHS#wasThisHelpful","R29O4Z59XY4CCP","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've had a Uniden system with 5 handsets for 15 years. The sound quality was great, battery life was great, but it simply wore out. We had to press the keys very hard to make them do their job. I took the phones apart and cleaned the contacts which used to fix the problem but that no longer works. So it was time for a new system. Unfortunately Uniden does not sell cordless phones in the United States any longer.The main things we wanted are a different list than many of the user reviews here. Our wants are simple. Basically we want the system to have the features of our 15 year old Uniden system.- Handsets with belt clips- Handsets with speaker phones- Handsets with backlit keys- Handsets with backlit information screens- Handsets with long battery life- Handsets with earphone jacks- Handsets with replaceable batteries- Handsets with a mute feature- Speed Dial- Long range- Good voice qualitySurprisingly there are a number of (non Panasonic) handsets out there missing one or more of the features listed above. Not only did this Link2Cell system have all of those features, it has a lot more. The best feature is people like this system as evidenced by the high ratings here on Amazon.com.One complaint, voiced by many others, is Panasonic really messed up the phone system design by forcing the use of numeric codes to access some features. An extended menu system without codes would be much better. With codes you must keep the user manual, search through it to find the feature you want to program, look up and enter the code on the phone. We have many electronic devices in the house, none of which require us to keep the user manual on hand to use the system. Panasonic should rethink this design.Some of the much appreciated features of this system are features we won't likely use including:- The answering machine- Bluetooth connection to our cell phones- The intercom features- Call blockingWe use an Ooma Telo VOIP system (less than $4/month). It has an answering machine with all the features we desire, so we don't need the answering machine of the Panasonic.I doubt if we would bother to link our cell phones to the Panasonic. We've not had that feature for years and we are happy to use our home phone and cell phones as is without linking them. If the system used WiFi instead of Bluetooth it would make much more sense to me. WiFi has a much longer range than the 30 foot range of Bluetooth. I do carry my smartphone with me at all times. There would be many times I would walk out of the 30' range of Bluetooth so the connection would be dropped. I'm more likely to be close to the cell phone than any of the five handsets. I did find it useful to transfer all of the contacts from my smartphone to the Panasonic system, but I then disconnected the phone from Bluetooth. I can certainly understand the benefits of the Bluetooth connection for those who set their smartphone down and leave it charging, then depend on the Panasonic system to make or receive calls.Our Uniden system has an intercom like the Panasonic but we've perhaps used it less than 5 times in 15 years. Those were times when one of us was confined to bed or were otherwise immobile due to medical reasons. We could have easily gotten along without the intercom. I do think it's a great feature for other households that perhaps are multi-level homes or very large homes.With our Ooma Telo system we simply do not receive robo-calls or other soliciting calls so the call blocking feature won't be used. We might get 4 or 5 of those types of calls a year.The Panasonic system, with 5 handsets, does match all of the features of our old Uniden system. The price wasn't too bad. The reviews are quite positive. The Panasonic system more than meets our needs. The handsets are significantly lighter than the weight of the old Uniden system, and the shape and size isn't much different than the Uniden handsets either.One improvement in the Panasonic system is the contact list is shared by all handsets. The Uniden system had a contact list per handset and it was a pain to keep them all the same.The Uniden has one very nice feature that I could not find in any other system. One of our Uniden handsets is submersible.  In a previous house we had a pool and spa so the submersible phone was ideal. In this house we have a Jacuzzi so we take that phone outside to that location too.Since no phone systems offer submersible handsets I am keeping the Uniden base unit for use with the one waterproof phone. I have daisy chained the Uniden and Panasonic base units and tested it. When I answer either phone system the other will stop ringing. We will toss out all of the other Uniden handsets that have begun to fail.My hope is this new Panasonic system will work as well, and as smoothly as our old system. I have every reason to believe it will.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9Z9EDLT0JGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BP7SW0C#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9Z9EDLT0JGH","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update August 5, 2015,I was pleased by the battery life today, the first day I've been able to use the tablet for an extended period of time. I easily got four hours of battery life, with 30% left when I plugged it in for a recharge. During that time I watched perhaps 20 minutes of video from various news services, Facebook, and Youtube. I loaded and tested several apps, read news stories, read and responded to youtube, read and responded to email. So, other than watching a lengthy video, pretty normal use.Batteries do ""season"" over the first 10 or 15 cycles (then they begin to deteriorate over the life of the product) so I expect to get even better battery life in the near future.The display is visible in 1/2 shade (not full sun but at the edge of full son) but by visible I mean I can see it if I work at it. It is quite usable in full shade, and actually quite bright indoors. Still the display is the weakest part of this tablet. As this is just a toy for me mostly, I won't be using it on a regular basis so it will fill my need and curiosity.I'm not a fan of tablets, but I do appreciate that the virtual keyboard on tablets is so much larger than my smartphone and I have much better accuracy typing on this 9"" tablet than I do my smartphone. Swype does work on it and I've used it but it will take some getting used to the much larger keyboard while using swype.Original Review...I just received this tablet about two hours ago. It is the first tablet purchased for this house, although I am no stranger to high tech equipment.My first impression after taking the tablet out of the box is, ""You get this for only $65!"" There is little to suggest this tablet costs a fraction of a high end tablet. Sure it is heavier and thicker, but not so much that makes a big difference really. It has a nice non-slip back that doesn't show fingerprints. There is a screen protector on the front which I will leave on as long as it isn't a problem. I won't be buying a screen protector just yet. Turning it on I quickly see that the screen is a weak point.The viewing angle is very narrow, just tilt it 30 degrees in any direction and the screen does not look good. Holding it parallel to my face isn't perfect either. I find I have to hold it tilted slightly up and to the left for the best viewing angle, and even at the best angle the display isn't crisp and it seems a bit washed out. I can see pixels, but the small text labels for the apps are very readable. It's not horrible, it's not great, it's somewhere in between. I found the brightness a bit too bright for my dark living room and turned it down. Turning the brightness all the way down I found it was a bit too bright to use in bed next to my sleeping wife. I'm sure I can find an app to cut the low end brightness. Is the screen usable. Yes.The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. It seems to be accurate. One bonus of the 9"" screen is I can type better on the virtual keyboard than I can on my smartphone. The tablet also supports swiping on the keyboard which is a big help. I have a couple of Bluetooth keyboards which might come in handy with this tablet. I bought them for use with my phone but it seems silly to carry a keyboard 4X the size of the phone so I don't use them.On the right side I find a small hole which is the microphone input, a Back button, the micro USB charge port, HDMI port, earphone jack, a reset hole, and the power button. All are labeled on the back of the tablet. A 2 Amp charge brick and five foot long USB cable came with it. They also included a 6"" USB cable but it has a female connector on the end which I'm not sure what it would be used for. On the back is a microSD card slot.I didn't pay much attention when I bought the tablet so I was surprised to learn there is a front and back camera. Neither one is very good. I don't plan to walk around with a tablet taking photos anyway so no big deal.PLAY STOREAt least one other reviewer said there was no Play Store app on the tablet. There is. Touch the up-arrow in the lower left corner of the display to bring up a bar along the bottom of the display. Then in the lower right corner there is a ""More"" button. Clicking the More button brings up a screen full of apps, one of which is the Play Store. Touch and hold the Play Store icon, then drag it to the bar along the bottom so it is easy to access the next time.I used the built in Browser to load the Chrome browser, then I moved the built in Browser to the list of apps in the More screen. That way I won't even see the built in browser. Yes the built in browser started showing ads along the bottom but I could just ignore them. Now with Chrome installed I won't have to be bothered by those ads.The tablet easily connected to my WiFi router. Just to try the Bluetooth I connected my little Bluetooth speaker and played a youtube video which worked fine with the sound coming from my Bluetooth speaker. It sounded great. Actually the Jay Leno's Garage video looked pretty good too. Turning off the Bluetooth to return to the internal speaker the sound was hollow, tinny, and not as good as either of my smartphones. Usable Yes but not great. The volume on the internal speaker was good enough for a quiet room.Trying the FM radio I plugged my earphones in. I did a quick search for a station and it worked as expected. I can also leave the earphones plugged in to act as the FM antenna, and then switch to the built in speaker or Bluetooth speaker. We don't get many FM stations here and I usually listen using the Tune-In internet radio app.Using the Maps / GPS was much more interesting to me. To be able to use this WiFi only tablet in the car for turn-by-turn directions I downloaded the excellent Nokia Here app with it's free offline maps.Everything went as smooth as silk. I now have a map for all of California loaded, and I have not yet inserted a microSD card. I can find nothing that indicates this tablet actually has GPS built in. I'll have to prove that by using it for navigation away from the WiFi of the house.SPEEDWell this tablet is no speed daemon, but it isn't all that bad. Just browsing or going through the actions to download apps there are some delays but that's just it - some brief delays. I can't say the speed is quick, or too slow, it is acceptable.I'm finding that if you take a cheap but reasonable tablet and run Android on it you have a lot of features and software available.Now to get down to the real reason I purchased this app. We own a Prius Generation II. The car has 152K miles on it and we've had it since it was new in 2008. Our average MPG over these 7+ years is about 45-47 mpg. Recently it dropped to about 35 mpg. Now 35 mpg isn't bad for most cars but it sucks in a Prius. I took the car to the Toyota dealer but all they did was look for engine codes and test drove it 7 miles; both of which I had already done. That was a waste of money.I purchased a Bluetooth ODB2 adapter for the car to broadcast data from the car to my smartphone. Then I purchased the Torque Pro app which has tons and tons of data that can be displayed. The trouble is the car has 14 banks in the High Voltage battery and there is more than one parameter that can be displayed per bank. Very quickly I ran out of screen space on my smartphone. Torque also wants to work with a GPS, although I don't think that is important for my needs. So I went looking for a tablet for more screen space. Let's see the vital Air 9"" has a lot more screen space, GPS, it has Bluetooth, it runs Android, and it is amazingly only $65! Wow that is a winner.Tablets have been on the market for years but I've never bought one. I just didn't see the need or usefulness of them until this particular application. They won't fit in my pocket like a smartphone, they don't have a keyboard so in that respect they aren't better than a smartphone. But for this price I can swallow that pill.Two to Four hours of battery life isn't very exciting but I can live with it. I hope it is reliable.I'll come back here for an update if I find anything interesting to add.For $65 I can recommend this tablet. It is sort of okay in several areas, rather than good, but okay in this price range isn't bad at all. So far I'm pretty happy with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DVJGXLPAKWHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM7N8QM#wasThisHelpful","R2DVJGXLPAKWHX","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mechanically this socket is fine. The wire is heavy gauge, the socket works well, and the cap stays in place. I mounted this on my motorcycle, attached to a key switchable 12V power source. I have RAM mounts to be able to mount my Garmin GPS, Nokia smart phone, or Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone.Plugging the Garmin into the charge socket seemed to work perfectly.Plugging the Nokia Lumia 635 smart phone worked but the phone reported it was connected to a ""slow charge"" port. This didn't make sense because the motorcycle 12V source is rated at 2 Amps, and this 12V to 5V converter socket is rated at 2.1 Amps. That should be plenty for the Nokia to be rated at full charge.Plugging the Galaxy S3 into the socket shows a red X on the battery icon of the phone. A red X indicates again a Slow Charge. What really worried me was when I saw the red X I thought the phone was damaged because I had never seen that red X before. I took the phone into the house and plugged it into a known high power source and it still showed the red X. I was very concerned that the charger socket permanently damaged my phone. The good news is later that evening the red X went away and the phone seems to be working normally.All indications are that this charger isn't putting out the advertised 2.1 Amps. I'm not sure if the charge will be able to keep up with the battery drain if I use my smartphone as a GPS.I will report back on the results when I have an occasion to use this charge socket for an extended period of time.

"I previously used Velcro to attach a small gauge to the steering column in my SUV. The hook and loop held okay, but the glue did not withstand the heat. The Velcro strip would shift and left a glue mess on the steering column.I used the same size strip of this Scotch 5731 Outdoor fastener which works much better. Not only does the glue on the back side of the fastener work well in the heat, but the way the product locks together is much  more solid than Velcro. My small gauge now both stays in place, but it is also rock solid rather than the rather loose feel of Velcro.Velcro is fine for many applications but where I need something stronger, or able to withstand heat I will use this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VV3CB496Z028/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I0GSGR0#wasThisHelpful","R3VV3CB496Z028","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I purchased my first (and only) GoPro Hero 4 Silver camera I didn't think I would need or want a camera case like this. Little did I know how many little pieces of attachments and options are available for these cameras. There are remotes, clips, tethers, batteries, SD cards, suction cups, tripod mounts, frames, microphones, lens covers, battery chargers, and more. The list goes on and on. So I did learn that I'd need a case, or rather more than one case.Like the other options there are many cases available. Cases to hold more than one GoPro camera, cases large and small, internally adjustable cases, fixed format cases, shoulder cases, travel cases, and dozens more.I now have three cases, one for a whole pile of GoPro attachments and accessories, one for longer trips like one week vacation trips, and this smaller case for day use. You're not likely to carry your small tripod in this case, unless it is a very small tripod. But you certainly can fit the camera in it's waterproof case, a couple of batteries, a couple of mounts, a battery charger, some memory cards, a tether, and a few more small items.Case Logic makes quality products. I have several Case Logic cases for my four digital cameras and they are all top quality. This case measures roughly 9"" x 6"" x 3"". It has one of my favorite features which is dual zipper pulls so it can be zipped from either side. I like to zip from both sides so the zipper pulls meet in the middle (yes a bit obsessive compulsive).There is good padding all around, about 1/4"" thick on the top and sides, but the bottom is thicker with a very firm rubber like construction.Inside there are four compartments as it comes from the factory. There are three dividers, one which is the full width, and two which reach from the back to the center where they meet the full width insert. These dividers have Velcro on the ends so they can be repositioned, but I would say the amount of adjustment is limited.  I'll include a few photos showing what I mean.This case has a hand strap, not a shoulder strap. There is a thin zippered pocket in the lid which is about the full size of the lid. There are also four mesh pockets for small items such as memory cards.So if the selection of things you want to bring along for a day will fit into this space then this case would be a great option. That is exactly what I'll use it for to keep my GoPro items together and safe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7FRO7NPQF51S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5RODTC#wasThisHelpful","R7FRO7NPQF51S","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aug 15, 2015 UpdateI had a warranty issue and contacted Contigo. There was a problem with the top. They sent me a whole new water bottle and top. Great service. This is the kind of service that brings me back.Original Review...I bought a two pack like this today at CostCo. I already own a Contigo Autoseal West Loop Stainless Steel Travel Mug which I have been very pleased with but I bought these mostly for the handle, and a different color.1) This has a flip up handle that makes it easier for me to carry. The West Loop requires me to grip it in the narrower portion which can get tiring.2) My previous water bottle is black which gets so hot in the sun that I can't handle it. I selected the silver (there being no white model) hoping that it will be cooler to the touch in the sun. I put my water bottle between the handlebars and the windscreen on my motorcycle where it is easy to drink from at a traffic signal, but it is also in direct sunlight most of the time. I wish Contigo made a white model.3) The mouth of the Contigo Autoseal West Loop Stainless Steel Travel Mug is just a bit larger. The size of the ice cubes from our refrigerator door front dispenser tend to clog up at the opening of this new bottle.4) The button to open the drinking port is larger on the Contigo Autoseal West Loop Stainless Steel Travel Mug which is about 2 finger size. I'm sure I'll get used to this smaller button.These Contigo water bottles keep water cold for many hours. They are leak-proof, and they don't have condensation on the outside. Any negative comments I have made should be taken in the context that they are just very minor. I just wanted to inform others who my potentially be comparing these two models.Pros:- Keeps water cold for many hours. I often leave the Contigo on my desk at night when I go to bed, and in the morning there is still ice in the bottle.- Quality is top notch with Contigo.- The one hand operation, using the button on the back side, is simple and works well.- No straw to deal with, lose, or to go bad.- Cap can be used to cover the drinking port to keep it clean. The cover can be permanently kept in the open position.- The handle smartly clicks into the closed position so it doesn't swing freely when not in use.Highly recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQ3GPNDAV374/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEWG108#wasThisHelpful","ROQ3GPNDAV374","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"High quality materials make this a nice looking bench that I expect to last for years. The powder coat paint on the metal looks like a heavy coating. I don't know what the Faux wood is made of but most of these new manufactured products hold up very well. Our bench will always be in the shade so I don't expect any fading of the Faux wood.It took me about 45 minutes to assemble the bench. It would have been more like 20 minutes with help but I did this while my wife was away.Everything was nicely packaged and labeled. Two tools are included, not as good as our own tools in the garage but I actually did use the little wrench for all of the nuts. The only improvement I would recommend to the company is for bolts with a hex head rather than a Phillips head for the seat and back. I felt the Phillips head screws were a bit hard to drive given that the nuts are of the lock tight type.The swing action is a bit short, not like the bench we replaced which would swing much further.If desired you could leave the swing portion off and just use this as a fixed position bench.It's a nice bench for a decent price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IOY7U98KH1QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00556W6EM#wasThisHelpful","R1IOY7U98KH1QM","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Case Logic makes high quality bags and backpacks. This KDH-101 is right in line with the high quality I've come to expect from Case Logic. I already have a Case Logic camera case similar to this KDH-101. The one I have has two pouches on the side large enough for a small tripod or an extra lens. It's a nice case but I rarely use it because it is too large. That is why I accepted this bag from the Vine program. I try not to accept anything from Amazon Vine unless I intend to use it. I was pleased that my standard configuration of camera, lens, and hood fit so well in this bag.This bag is padded on all sides, bottom and top. It is not too thick, keeping the bag dimensions small, yet it provides good protection for a day carry bag.The shoulder strap is gratefully long. It adjusts easily and stays in place after I adjusted it. The clips on the end of the shoulder strap swivel. There is also a substantial hand strap on top of the bag.The bag is designed to fit against the body, with a firm flat surface on that side making it comfortable. There are three pockets on the sides, but no pocket on the side against the body so no zipper or zipper pull to irritate. The three small pockets on the sides and front are small but sufficient for a couple of lens filters, SD cards, and an extra battery or two. The zippers all have a metal pull but there is a small black strap threaded through the pull which allows for an easy comfortable grip to open or close the zippers.The top of the bag opens away from the wearer which is great so the flap isn't trying to close as I am putting the camera in or taking it out of the bag. My one and only complaint about this bag is there is a single zipper pull for the zipper which goes 3/4 of the way around the bag. I would prefer two pulls as are so often available on zippers. First that would make life easier for both right and left handed users. Second I would prefer to pull from both sides, closing the zipper in the middle. That's just a habit of mine.Inside the top of the bag there is another small zippered pocket, again perhaps large enough for a couple of SD cards in their plastic containers.The inside business part of the bag opening is roughly 5 1/4"" wide (a little wider at the side nearest the body) x 5"". The depth is 9"" close to the body, and 8"" where the top flap is hinged. That is just about perfect for my camera, with my walk-around lens, and the lens hood attached. My camera from the rear edge of the view finder to the outer edge of the hood measures 8 1/4"" so it fits great. My camera's body is 5"" wide.The bag is advertised as a Zoom Holster bag. That is a pretty loose term as there certainly are a wide variety of sizes of zoom lenses. I have one that definitely would not fit in this bag, even without the camera body attached! So pay attention to the dimensions. My camera is a Sony A65 mirror-less model. It tends to be smaller than many other cameras. The average DSLR camera body is larger than the Sony A65. I don't have the width of those cameras but anything over 5 1/2"" may not fit.One of the main features of the bag is that it has a suspension, or hammock, system. It consists of a cloth insert Velcro'ed to the sides of the case. There is a hole in the middle of the insert with three neoprene flaps. You drop the camera in, the lens pushes the flaps back slipping through, and the body of the camera rests against the cloth insert. With the insert adjusted properly, if the lens isn't too long, the camera will hang inside of the bag. The lens won't touch the bottom of the bag. Great system. The 16-50mm f2.8 lens I am using as an example is a large lens. Adding to that is the lens hood. That combination on my camera makes it a little harder to push the hood and lens through the bag's insert. Then pulling the camera out of the bag the lens and hood tend to catch a bit on the hammock insert as well. The average lens and hood are likely smaller making those operations easier.I will use this bag. That will allow me to have my hands free until I want to take photos. It is a good addition to my camera equipment.The 48 second video at the top of the product page is quite good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZHJ9DLP9D8FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQ8DRL4#wasThisHelpful","RZHJ9DLP9D8FG","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife and I think NCIS is the best TV program ever put on the small screen. We, of course, watch every new episode during the regular season. But to fill in the summer we've been buying the NCIS season DVDs and watching between 7 and 14 episodes per week. They are even better the second time.Watching the second time over is great because we know the characters and longer term story lines already so we can appreciate little things that may have escaped us the first time. Following almost every episode one of us declares, ""This is a really good show.""The mix of smart detective work, good story lines, excellent dialog, character interaction, and humor simply isn't duplicated anywhere else. We hope NCIS continues for at least 20 seasons.We never could get interested in NCIS Los Angeles, too much flash and not enough detective work, bad dialog, and poorly cast.However, after giving it a chance for several episodes, we really like NCIS New Orleans. We really like Scott Bakula. Lucas Black is good but I find him difficult to understand sometimes. I'm not crazy about Zoe McLellan.Back on NCIS every member of the cast is perfectly cast. Who doesn't love Abby. Ducky is wonderful. Gibbs sets a new standard for subtle while being right. Tony provides the comedy. Siva is great but I wish the director/writers would make use of her fighting capability more often. McGee does a great job as the technical guy and it's good to see him pushing back on Tony. McGee seems to be coming into his own in the later seasons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FU4V7PRAK327/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00915G6MG#wasThisHelpful","R2FU4V7PRAK327","ABVYGB2TKBO8F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVYGB2TKBO8F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is Fast and Raw. With fast, the unit quickly removes initial moisture by cycling about the set point. Then it automatically sets itself to the second and more thorough mode.

There's a lot of basic information in here, perfect for a tween or teen who is ready to expose herself to different flavors of nerd culture. And those who are ready to move into deeper levels of geek, there's a lot of practical information about cons, cosplay, and media.The big question with a fairly brief book like this is -- does it have to be a book or would it function better online? In this instance, I wholeheartedly feel that this is a book. It is well-designed, punchy, and satisfying in this format. It is engineered for quick access to different sorts of info.

"This is a great, basic economy stroller.It has 439 fewer features than other strollers -- but with a retail price of below $80 with shipping (right now, at least) there isn't much to argue about. When it comes to a basic stroller, I'm interested in just a few things: how well does it handle?, how heavy is it?, is it sturdy?, is the carriage comfy, and can I fold it up without an advanced degree? This stroller does all of these things rather well! It handles nicely, pivots well, and has a pretty smooth ride. I can lug it around with one arm easily. The carriage -- so far -- seems comfy and secure. This thing seems rock solid! Finally, the folding apparatus is smooth and idiot-proof.These are my impressions after only a couple of days of use...maybe some other reviewers will be able to weigh in about how it holds up over time.Finally, I like the dots.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZXDXKSS49MGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTTJSH2#wasThisHelpful","RZXDXKSS49MGC","A2L7N2U5Z316ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L7N2U5Z316ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is set in a very cold 1970's crime world and has much of the intimacy and darkness you would expect from Nesbo. That being said, this is a rather brief book and doesn't provide the sort of rich and enveloping experience that a longer crime novel can.

Well over an hour of work. And it required a little strength.

"This is a peppy, intelligent, and well-structured introduction to providing customers with excellent experiences.Consistent with the 21st century's focus on fully-integrated customer service, this book is not simply a list of ""things you should never do"" and ""ways to handle the angry customer."" Sure, this sort of information is important -- and the book does specifically handle strategies for placating the angry customer -- but the thrust here is much more positive and proactive. For example, how one actually creates a customer-centric culture. To no one's suprise, this is a For Dummies book which means that it has relatively simple prose.

"This is somewhat high-priced coffee maker that makes an excellent cup of coffee. Perhaps it is the ""blooming"" feature that primes the ground beans with hot water before the dripping begins.

Very nice!I don't think this is going to win any design awards. This is a surprisingly bulky machine. Everything seems heavier or larger than it needs to be. Replacing the detachable lid on the water reservoir requires trial and error. They should have just hinged it. And the whole thing looks like a piece from a turbine from a factory in 1936.

Yes, there are plot twists, yes, the Vatican sits at the center of things, yes, ""you can't put it down,"" but this is a much more measured, more literary, and less cliche-ridden novel. The pace is oddly deliberate at times. Caldwell is interested in much more than plot and takes time to explore his characters.

"A quality home theater system that yields rich and robust sound and particularly bright and satisfying highs.Bose apparently decided that it wants to create small-sized speaker systems that blow you away with how much volume they produce -- and the Cinemate 120 does not disappoint. Personally, I'm fine with big-sound-out-of-small-size, but what makes me very happy about this system is that it is only 3 pieces plus the remote. I think the days of 5 speaker systems might be ending.I've had Bose systems with an Acoustimas Module (a wireless subwoofer) before and there was one Bose characteristic that I thought was a problem -- a difference in timber or tenor between the sound coming out of the speakers and the sound coming out of the Acostimas Module.

There's no ""squish"" to it and it keeps my head up too high.Now I think it is a quality pillow with a nice big ridge on the top, a smaller ridge on the bottom, and an indentation where you can place your head.

"The last time I read Alice Munro was... I don't know. Why on earth have I been denying myself the work of Munro, surely one of the great prose masters of our time? These are dense, well-crafted, stories that appear to meander, that appear to be full of the incidental, but which eventually reveal themselves to be astonishingly well-crafted. The work here is memorable, and adult. In terms of length, depth and authority, calling these short stories is inadequate. Perhaps they should be classified as novellas.

"Wonderful toy.My cat wouldn't play with it, but she is a special case.Simple design: some nice soft feathers on the end of a rod. The base is a ball. When turned on, the feathers move about on the rod in an irregular and tempting manner. Since the base is a ball, that moves a bit too. If the cat starts to attack, you get moving feathers plus a moving rod on a roll-y ball. Tons of activity! And there is NO ANNOYING MOTOR NOISE. Seems to me like a very safe toy.My cat won't hunt something like this. She needs her toys to be more animal-y. And she distrusts movement from any motor.

"This is an adequate and well-assembled textbook. Published in 2013, it is still fairly up-to-date. CRC has taken materials from other CRC authors and combined it into this Reader which means that some of this data was collected long before 2013.This is a comprehensive, detailed, and somewhat uninspired collection. It begins with about ten pages of terrorism definitions and a brief history of terrorism. Then it has some list-y chapters outlining the different sorts of domestic and international terrorism. The book really hits its stride in two detailed and comprehensive sections: a detailed examination of the structure of terrorist organizations and a discussion of terrorist organizations' Attack Cycles and general modes of operation.While much of the prose is adequate, this book does provide rather wide coverage of the topic and will certainly be of use in a number of college courses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYTQBYCOVER2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1466588322#wasThisHelpful","RYTQBYCOVER2D","A2L7N2U5Z316ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L7N2U5Z316ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Printer started working with my laptop running Windows 8 instantly. No fuss, no problems.Operations easy as well. Don't have to think to do basic stuff.This takes up A LOT less space than the last two Canon printers I bought.

But this never works if I am doing dishes and the cat hates it when it gets too loud. And sometimes I just get sick of the earbuds. Too insular.This speaker -- efficient, well-designed, and adorable -- solves all these problems. Simple bluetooth device. Played out of the box for me in about 90 seconds. It is water-resistant, has a big hook which allows you to hang it or prop it up. The sound is great. It is basic sound. Great volume for up to 15-25 feet away, very nice middles, decent lows, not much highs. You can play sound engineer by placing it up or near different surfaces.

"Pierce's perceptive and sensitive book identifies and defines the older and more traditional governance models which are increasingly unsuited to 21st century. She essentially believes that the older ""shared governance"" models are stodgy and moss-grown. They reinforce institutional norms and are particularly ill-suited to more dynamic periods of change. And this is, indeed, a time of dynamism, Pierce argues: governmental doubt and lessened funding, the introduction of potential game-changers like online education, changing employment opportunities, for graduates, and a growing political distrust of higher education are all present.

More generally, this is an up-to-date look at the sort of statistical analysis that occurs at the juncture of medicine and statistics with a particular interest in the steps that can be taken to identify correlative patterns among huge data samples.

Nonetheless, developing computational, visual, and statistical tools that can be applied to microarray data is both the present and the future. Some of the analytics that receive a close look in this book are ABC clustering, biclustering, ensemble methods, and partial least squares.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJENECS3FMBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118356330#wasThisHelpful","R1WJENECS3FMBQ","A2L7N2U5Z316ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L7N2U5Z316ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a highly professional, caring, and comprehensive examination of the ways in which services can be provided for individuals in the home environment. Stated very simply, the central proposition here is that those who need services in the home are best-served by multiple helpers -- professionals and non-professionals -- who collaborate.However, providing such care is rarely simple and the book embraces these complexities. There's an admirable mix of the theoretical and the practical here. The book provides broad perspectives and then elegantly narrows in on specifics. This isn't a book of ""case studies"" per se, but the authors recognize the human dimension in this topic and provide many vignettes of home-based services -- involving both care-receivers and their families -- that I found quite illuminating.A great deal of attention is paid here to visualizing, devising, and managing a ""map"" of services. And a map such as this will, over time, change, and the authors discuss the importance of adapting care to changing situations.The entire tone adopted here -- both in the prose and in the ways in which services are provided -- is positive and life-affirming. So welcome!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R392SWHWDO70L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118567633#wasThisHelpful","R392SWHWDO70L8","A2L7N2U5Z316ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L7N2U5Z316ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little book is a series of essays that are particularly well-illustrated. The essays are all focused on the employment of incredibly accurate digital metrology technology in architecture and in, well, hypothetically any process that involves the manipulation of forms in three dimensions. While I welcome a detailed discussion of these methods in practice (with some theory thrown in for good measure), this isn't so much a ""book"" as it is a magazine. The essays are free-standing. The worst thing that can be said about the prose here is that it has a marketing/promotional/public relations tone. There's a fine line between praising a technology or a company and hyping it, and there's more than a little hype to be found here.Bottom line: if you want an update on some inspiring examples of high definition technology right now, pick this up.

"This well-argued little book paints a fairly bleak view of the efficacy of social movements and activism at this time. While there have been some incredibly powerful and well-covered activist movements (Occupy and the Arab Spring come to mind and one can certainly add The Tea Party to this argument as well), all fueled by social media, the results from these movements are lackluster at best. However, the pessimism that this book puts forward is not simply that of a social movement that generated more heat than results. Corporatization of activism is weakening the very core of that activism and the people on the front lines of the struggle lack the perspective to see their efforts within that larger picture. The book is to be commended for the fact that it uses actual ""case studies"" and wants to focus on specifics rather than couching the whole thing in theory or larger social science perspectives. Because of this, the book manages to be a popular read while still grappling with complex issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16XFIQJTJS7D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745669492#wasThisHelpful","R16XFIQJTJS7D4","A2L7N2U5Z316ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L7N2U5Z316ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're in the midst of an ""arms race"" of shaving technology. As a long-time user of Gillette products, the big question here is...Is this latest product (more expensive) an improvement from the previous iteration, the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor? I did a side-by-side comparison of two and concluded that I prefer the older power Proglide razor much more BUT that the newer blades (""our thinnest, finest razor blades"") are indeed an improvement. Some thoughts about this new product, the Fusion Proglide Manual Men's Razor with Flexball Handle Technology...1. This is a remarkably ugly razor. It is a cross between a muscle car and R2-D2. This is the sort of product design that will appear comical to us in 30 years.2. The Flexball Handle really does flex all over your face. There's an awful lot of movement on this razor. I found I didn't like the sensation at all and it didn't give me any more control. (And I need control -- I shave my face really quickly.)3. I think the vibrating power razor is always superior and paying more for a non-power razor seems like a step backwards.4. The new blades really did have less drag than the older generation. Quite smooth and efficient.There are a lot of choices out there and a lot of excellent products -- many of them made by Gillette. This is, as I expected it to be, remarkably well-engineered and not cheaply priced.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RISBRLGWSVNZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2AP9F0#wasThisHelpful","RISBRLGWSVNZO","A2L7N2U5Z316ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L7N2U5Z316ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"i fully expected this Ching book to be Ching-like: elegantly designed, sophisticated and yet crystal clear in the way that the visual information is presented. However, what is particularly strong about this book is that it can be used as a reference book while still possessing ""narrative"" qualities that allow it to be ""read"" from start to finish.What do I mean by this? The organization and layout of the book allow it to be used on occasion to answer a question or provide clarity on a specific issue -- therefore making it a reference. However, the sequencing of this book is very logical and pleasing in its own right. It begins with large and even somewhat abstract issues of design, then progresses into site-related issues, and then tackles very specific areas of construction. Thus, it pleasantly moves from the semi-abstract to the very concrete.As you might expect from a book from Wiley, it is well-designed and sturdily bound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AAEW15XMG8KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118562372#wasThisHelpful","R3AAEW15XMG8KZ","A2L7N2U5Z316ZE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L7N2U5Z316ZE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ching's clear, carefully framed, and distinctive graphic style is used to great effect in this well-designed book. The framing of the images is excellent, only in a few instances did I think the information was a bit too over-exploded since the signature Ching vertices communicate a lot of information.It should be stressed that this book is very heavily-grounded in U.K. construction techniques. I imagine that many of the U.K. best practices carry over to the Continent but the book does not really address this issue.

"All of the ""For Dummies"" books are well done, but going from Windows 7 to Windows 10 is a bit of a leap for me because although the new OS is very user friendly it is a new look and feel. The breakthrough here is that this new system is a big step in the direction of a full touch interface. The problem is the flexibility; those of us who are not computer savvy can easily activate functions that we do not understand and may find it difficult to return to the original state. This book has features such as large print and many clear illustrations, and most will find it a most helpful aid in setting the desktop up and making some choices about this versatile operating system.

"This book was a hit with my 92 year old father in law. He was an aircraft mechanic in WW2 and was always very handy around the house, but the newer electronics were quite a challenge for him. He was the kind of man who would test the vacuum tubes in the TV, but solid state electronics were something he had to learn about in his eighties. Because we had provided him with a Dummies book to help him with his first laptop, he was comfortable with it, learned the Internet, and had even decided to try his hand at digital photography,  When we finally convinced him to give up his flip phone, he did a lot of reading and ordered an IPhone As soon as he received it, he began carefully reading the instructions, but he had a tough time because he had no knowledge of the terms involved. Since we had given him a copy of one of Nancy Muir's Dummy books last year, and he liked it, we surprised him with this one as well. The attention to large color pictures, one to a page, and the clear step by step instructions were perfect, and the way the book I organized, he could decide what he wanted to learn each day and go to it, as each topic is largely self contained.  We were very happy to see him learning again at his age. I would recommend this book to anyone, senior or not, who is having difficulty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q3R84HVYBHYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118944445#wasThisHelpful","R2Q3R84HVYBHYM","A3MX96YM4NT6HT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MX96YM4NT6HT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a retired Corporate Trainer and Instructional Designer, and a senior myself, I set high standards for books designed for seniors. In the past, Nancy Muir has always been my personal favorite for the senior audience, and this time is no different. For those who began using the Android operating system on their phones and tablets, the iPad can be challenging; and that is due mostly to the different look and feel of the entire portfolio of Apple products.. The irony is, that once you are familiar with any Apple product, you have unlocked the key to the entire range of phones, tablets, and pcs. Seniors owe it to themselves to have a book like this at their side to explore their new Apple iPad one feature at a time, and Nancy Muir has made this easy in this book. No wonder this is the Number One seller on Amazon for iPad instruction books, and it is aimed squarely at seniors and their needs and learning styles.

The readout has large numbers and a pleasant red glow, but just as important it has a large base which prevents tipping and gives this a more substantial feel than many others.

"...If you can't perform like a twenty year old at 70! Testosterone fueled passion that lasts for 4 minutes is nothing to brag about anyway. We men are never taught that our sex lives must evolve as we age and hopefully become more sophisticated and aware of the nuances of sex, and the needs of our partner. In our youth, as men, we tend to ignore the emotional side of physical love in favor of performance (because that's what the ladies want, of course). Joan's book was a real eye opener for me, helping me to understand that there is a broad spectrum of intimacy, much of which does not involve penetration, and as men age, they can evolve. Her suggestions are insightful and practical, and will be of value to any man over the age of 50, 60, or 70. This is one of the best books on sexuality for men (and the women they love) of any age. Written not by a doctor with a sure-fire cure for ED, or a psychologist who assures us that "" it happens to everyone"", Joan Price is a woman of a certain age who is willing to tell us what so many are not: the ladies get it, and they are willing to  show us a few cool moves if we are willing to listen.

"We've all seen the ""reality"" TV shows many times and wondered what goes on behind the scenes. Well, thanks to Caitlyn Duffy's excellent novel, now we do! As an ancient grandma, I never expected to be so enjoying Young Adult fare, but I am thoroughly enjoying this series.Allison sends her video entry to the reality singing competition not expecting to get through, but of course she does. At the auditions, she comes across Elliott Mercer, a moody, enigmatic youth with an incredible voice and presentation. She thinks he is the one she has to beat,but little does she realise that her conception of reality is somewhat different to that of the show's producers!Caitlyn Duffy has written a suspenseful novel, during which this reader grew increasingly concerned for Allison's safety. Someone very nasty is sabotaging her performances - is it horrible Robyn? Or is it actually her mentor, a superstar who really should be coaching her group and not running around assisting a famous rock star to cheat on his wife? The ending was a complete surprise and a pleasure, as I was wondering how the author was going to satisfy the hopes of the reader.I just loved this well-written story, was fascinated by the various shenanigans of the characters and can assure readers of all ages that they will too  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I26DNDBICM0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01427HP5E#wasThisHelpful","R3I26DNDBICM0B","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a disappointing read. I got this book and was looking forward to it, but I couldn't believe what was going on! The characters were unbelievable. The husband was a monster who never bothered to explain himself and was alternatively loving and then totally horrible.SPOILER ***********************The wife had everything that could possibly go wrong happen to her. She runs from the house, pregnant, after being verbally abused by the husband, he chases after her and has an accident which over the course of time, she is apparently too sick to find out about despite it being all over the news and the internet. She tries to ring his work and they won't put her through, so then she falls sick - over and over - has a terrible birth where she nearly dies and although she gives the hospital the husband's details, it appears that no one rings him. He can't find her even though he knows she was pregnant but doesn't even think to ring the hospitals or check birth records.The heroine goes back to vet school - but she hardly does any study and certainly doesn't do any practical work. The family doesn't even have a pet while she is studying vet science - though it's probably for the best considering this unstable household.I lost patience with this pair - the kid was a pain in the bum as well - and in view of the appalling stats here in Australia - 65 women and several children dead from domestic violence this year alone - I couldn't cope with the abuse in this book.I am sorry to have to write a review like this, but really, it was too much.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OIKXMWX87X7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPYGZDW#wasThisHelpful","R3OIKXMWX87X7K","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I liked Jeanne, the heroine of the book, and the characters were reasonably interesting, however, I don't think the reader gets to know Nick very well.

I picked the villains in the story very early on.I really do think the author lost the pace for a mystery in this one as for me it only had a few areas of quiet suspense.

"I got this book from our local library and thoroughly enjoyed it. Beginning with a murder and ending with a suicide - well, it's the in-between that is riveting. Robert Rotenberg makes a good job of presenting interesting and likable characters.

"It would be hard to find as engaging a heroine as Venkataraman's Jamie Quinn, lawyer and all round good egg  :)  I thoroughly enjoyed this Jamie Quinn mystery, involving high-powered sleazy lawyer, Martin Glasser and his wife, who is intent on getting a divorce no matter how much her husband threatens anyone who tries to help her.Jamie and her best friend, Grace, take on the establishment to obtain Nan's divorce, but after a tiff, Grace decides not to speak to Jamie. This means that Jamie is left alone to fight for Nan's rights and investigate the accident which killed her next door neighbour's twin sister, Sara, and her husband. Drug lords, money laundering and murder are right up there in this exciting novel. Fast-paced and well written, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCRQ6YNMS3DPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159LGVHA#wasThisHelpful","RCRQ6YNMS3DPC","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holly Love is not the first girl to be ensnared by the dastardly Andrew McNish. Blithely accepting his stories of being in finance and accepting his proposal, she chucks in her job and heads for the Blue Mountains - yes, this is an Australian novel set in Australia - a great treat for an Australian reviewer! Of course, Andrew has flown the coop, taking Holly's money with her. Shocked, she engages a rather seedy Private Investigator, O.Brien, who promptly gets himself...well, dead...The adventures of Holly, as she gathers new friends and a cockatoo along the way, are bright, sparkling and funny.

"For me, this book doesn't live up to the author's reputation. An intricate plot, but a messy lot of characters made this hard to read. I didn't enjoy the babies mix in it, the homosexual mix, the film star mix, the belligerent cop mix, the hot SEAL mix and the serial killer mix...it came across as though the author threw everything she could think of into the plot and the result was a mishmash of happenings. I wasn't sure who was with whom, there was too much domesticity in the plot which kept getting in the way of suspense. I didn't have any beef with the homosexual mix, only that it was one more thing to get my head around.The pace was slow, with a lot of - IMO - unnecessary side-stories which didn't allow for tension to get through. The final part of the book the pace picked up, but it could have been a ripping thriller if the author had allowed it to be.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJZQ9OBOME6RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BDOK6W#wasThisHelpful","RJZQ9OBOME6RT","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The book overall was a surprise in that it was so dark - although the cover should have indicated some nastiness. The animal abuse almost put me off so that I almost stopped reading it, however I persevered. The depiction of small town spite and gossip rang very true. The corruption in the administration came through loud and clear, the atmosphere and ""saving ones backs"" rang true.A good effort - apart from the animal abuse which I don't think is necessary in any book. We can tell the type of character without horrific details. Certainly, I know it is ""only"" a story but only too true. This type of thing is all too prevalent. I am giving this book four stars because it had more going for it than my one complaint which I've covered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XBTXLK70UE7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW8JIEY#wasThisHelpful","R2XBTXLK70UE7P","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There have been, and undoubtedly will be, thousands of novels about female friendship being published. Liz Byrski's Last Chance Cafe is - in a nutshell  - warm and moving. That she has chosen to work the plot primarily around women in old age, is interesting and she adds in their daughters and nieces as well.For Margot shopping malls are a necessary evil. Tramping through one, on the hunt for a new dress to wear at her sister Phyl's fiftieth wedding anniversary, she hears a commotion coming from the escalators. Imagine her astonishment, when she sees an old friend, in every sense of the word, chained to the escalator, screaming about the manipulation of women and girls by the media and fashion gurus. Dot is supposed to be meditating in India, and when the security guards cut her free with bolt cutters, much to her disgust, she admits that demonstrating is getting a bit beyond her, but that for a moment there, she'd felt the old fires burning.The story revolves around the two sisters - Phyl and Margot - Margot's daughters, Emma (who is having problems being a mother) and Lexie who has been made redundant by her employers and is left bereft. Her so-called love life has ended as well.Dot - who has some well kept secrets and Vanni - also keeping some whoppers - are drawn into the circle and fire up the new generation to protest about the exploitation of women. In the process, some interesting things come to life about Phyl's marriage - the 50th Anniversary party ends dramatically - Dot's past and all their futures.I enjoyed this novel and thought the way Liz Byrnski wove her plot in and out of the women's lives was expertly done. Yes, there was political matters in there, but being of the age where I lived through these, didn't find that they detracted in any way from the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQ2MXXHPXO6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VQDPII#wasThisHelpful","R1RQ2MXXHPXO6G","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the early 1900s when the main part of this story was set, women were treated appallingly. Lily, now in a nursing home, reminisces auot her childhood and speculates on what happened to her sister, Violet.This is a beautifully written story covering many aspects of women's lives at that time. To say there are some surprises is not exaggerating. I don't want to give any spoilers so I will just urge anyone who comes across this relatively short novella to read it. You will not be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQVUPFMX2BQ75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J714BB2#wasThisHelpful","RQVUPFMX2BQ75","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book started off with great promise. I had the expected negative response to the main character, Vincent, and his shenanigans with women and I really enjoyed Annie and her backstory.To be honest, I think the author missed a great chance here to turn a good story into a great one! There seemed to be large gaps between events in the character's lives - e.g. Vincent leave the manuscript for awhile and suddenly reappears after Annie gets her own vet practice. I liked the part where Annie's husband leaves and about Annie's circumstances, but she suddenly turns up in Little Creek with her own practice. I liked the way Vincent picks the dog off the road and takes it to Annie's surgery and so they meet. Any books with animals in will always get me in.The story moves along at a rather rapid pace for someone to get used to Vincent's changed circumstances, and Annie seems to have no thought in particular about that. Her mad decision re Vincent is, quite frankly, ridiculous and seemed to be just in there to create a dilemma for the characters. I'm trying hard here not to give spoilers!Perhaps I'd better just say that I was disappointed that the story was wound up so fast. I felt as though the author was intent on writing a short book - perhaps because apparently people seem to like short books these days - but I think that if this was the case, it short-changed what could have been a real ""humdinger"" of a story. Depth of character is what drives a book for me, and this one could well have had me cheering Vincent and Annie on and it did to a certain extent, but the brevity of the ending fixed that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VXAXA22WYRFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZMYFB4Y#wasThisHelpful","R3VXAXA22WYRFF","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without a doubt, Caitlyn Duffy is the finest author writing for the Young Adult market. I thoroughly enjoyed this latest of her books about young people coping with life. Cassie, lonely and jaded by having to move around frequently with her mother who is an Airforce officer, is puzzled whne her teacher singles her out and coaxes her to join the theatre group. She has not played her guitar for some time, so if ambivalent about putting her name down in the music section, but having met Elliott at the group, Cassie decides that maybe things might be looking up.Unfortunately, Cassie is not used to making friends and mistakes the overtures of Melissa's - the rich girl in the theatre group - for a snide type of communication, not realising that indeed Melissa wants to genuinely make friends with Cassie. Nor does Cassie trust in confiding in her mother and almost gets herself into strife because of her lack of communication.This well-written and delightful story is marred by only one thing - it ends abruptly! I would love to have learned what happens and suspect that this might be addressed in another book further down the track. Let's hope Ms Duffy gets to and immediately writes the next in this series or - alternatively - adds a few chapters to this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXZDPBPKBOJDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141NA3IA#wasThisHelpful","RXZDPBPKBOJDP","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like many, I had no idea what went on in Germany while the Cold War was in play - but now I know!Doug DePew has an engaging style which is easy to read and to understand how things were from his perspective. This memory of a bunch of hormonal madmen loose in Germany is delightful - one storyof note - the Lt Colonel in the hotel (No, you have to read it yourself!) -  will stick in MY memory for a long time!What I particularly liked about this memoir is the joyous and funny life those young men led. Oh yes, there was fighting and lots and lots of drinking (they could have almost been Australians - but not quite!) but at heart they knew what they were there for and when the chips were down, they faced their fears and responsibilities with courage.

"This is not a book for the faint-hearted.Firstly I liked the way the chapters were sectioned - Prelude and Theme, Beguine, Love Song, Trio for Trumpet, Flute and Soprano, Sonata Appasionata, Jamm'n the Blues, Finale, Reprise and Coda thereby setting the phases of Carrie and Stan's love affair. This made the dips into the past very easy to read and didn't sidetrack the plot.Basically, Karen Morgan, Judge, is no longer Carrie Moon, but when Stan phones after 12 years of silence, her heart is awakened once more. Trapped in a loveless marriage, Karen cannot prevent Carrie from rising from the ashes of the past. There were many occasions when I wanted to punch Stan out and many times when I wanted to say to Karen - forget it, give him up and find someone who is worthy of the love you have to give.I don't want to give any spoilers, so I will be content with saying that the author is brilliant at wringing the heart of her reader as hard as she does that of Karen Morgan.

"This book was good in places and not so good in others. The heroine was very negative and there was no real attempt to flesh out her relationship with her parents or her brother. Some inconsistencies, but the tone was good-natured overall. David, the husband, was very lax with Evelyn, particularly where the lawyers were concerned, but other parts of the book where they hooked up emotionally were good. A little too much explicit sex for my taste and the obvious Australianism's in a book set in the USA were out of place.Overall, the book didn't set the world on fire,but neither was it awful.

"I was asked for a review of this book and though I was a little wary when I realised that the characters are apparently what is termed ""young adult"" I soon settled into the plot.Fast-paced, this well-written book didn't let up for a moment. The nasty plot to destroy a company and it's staff sends Tulsa and Liberty hunting through cyberspace for the perpetrator. The backstory - Tulsa and her partners in Scandals Investigations are half-siblings who have actually just met after their father died - is interesting but I found it a little confusing as to which characters were the siblings and who were their partners. This did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the novel. The descriptions of the technical aspects of the hunt - Tulsa is an IT expert - were not hard to follow - thank you, author - and the revelation of the mastermind behind the cyber attacks and some rather nasty real ones was well told.What I really liked about this book was the energy in the writing and the naturalness of the characters.

"Having read The Christmas Violin, I was eager to read this book, so duly logged on and purchased it. However, it didn't have the charm of Violin - well, it was a dark subject after all - but unfortunately it did not have many light moments either, being pretty much all about ""Poor Sarah.""The character of Sarah is weak. She has a dreadful father who disowns her, but she has a loving grandmother who gives her everything she can and still Sarah chooses to allow herself to be hurt - constantly.The problem of bullying looms large in this book and it is a salutary lesson for readers, particularly for young female readers. Sarah is continually cowering in front of the chief bully and I found that a huge downer as far as this book is concerned. If she had stood up for herself and made her grandmother proud of her granddaughter's backbone, I might have liked this book more.The ending is well told and no, I didn't really cotton on to what was going to happen until around 3/4 of the way through, but there was an unfinished piece of information right at the end - the last paragraph.

"Okay, I admit it - I got the book from the library because I saw it there on the returns shelf. I totally loved it.From the opening pages, Crais lets the reader into Maggie's head, instilling a deep sense of foreboding. This cannot end well for either Maggie or Pete - well I read the synopsis, so I knew that - but reading it and then getting pulled into the story are two different things. Maggie is beautiful - sensitive of course, her nose is her fortune - but sadly, she is suffering PTDS. Her new handler, Scott James, is no better off. This is shown in stark reality when Scott and Maggie pretty much collapse when the officer in charge of the K-9 squad fires a starter pistol behind them.How Maggie and Scott survive their training and bring down the killers of Scott's former police partner, Stephanie, injuring Scott as well, makes riveting reading. I do hope Robert Crais brings out another Maggie and Scott book in the future.The twists in this novel are brilliantly plotted and the suspense is constant. I found myself tensing with every chapter, wondering if Maggie - or Scott - or both, were going to be hurt. The supporting cast are strong, there are no weak links, but make no mistake about it, this is Maggie's story!I checked the mood as ""hopeful"" in the lead up to this review, because in spite of the subject matter, hope shines through every moment for both Maggie and Scott.I just LOVED it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKIFN2R1R0360/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZ0HGJI#wasThisHelpful","RKIFN2R1R0360","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was delighted when Google Alerts advised me that there was a new Dave Mason novel available, carefully crafted and presented by Mar Preston. The subject matter, a private high school, sounded intriguing, so I hastened to purchase the book.I was not disappointed! The characters are well developed and their back stories blended well into the action. What was really quite fascinating was the attention to detail in the mannerisms of the detectives and perhaps to a lesser extent, the members of the staff of the school. Sights, sounds and smells are variables drummed into the aspiring author via workshops and there was no limit to the amount of these in this novel. The suspense was cracking, only letting up for the reader to catch - in this case, moi - breath and then relentlessly pulling me into the undertow of deceit, fraud and murder.I particularly liked the ending of this novel and no, no spoilers!Well done indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3GKET01B0WV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010YF49XO#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3GKET01B0WV","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Robbie - a delightful character - come back to support her.I don't want to give any spoilers, but this novel is heart-warming and interesting and in some places sad. I liked the characters and felt concerned for their future. There are some flashbacks which explain Zoe and Robbie's close friendship and gradual falling in love but these work very well without being intrusive.I enjoyed this novel!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVR2V78E38U1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KOX5WC#wasThisHelpful","RVR2V78E38U1D","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wayne Zurl's Sam Jenkins series has always been a favourite of mine. Sam is the quiet, laid back and unassuming Chief of Prospect Police Department. Aided and abetted by his sidekick, Bettye and his team of officers, Sam enjoys great success. There's an old saying - ""There's nothing as queer as folks!"" and indeed the folks in this collection are unique!The stories, written in the first person for the most part, are funny, deep, sad - every aspect of human life is covered - and I thoroughly enjoyed every one. I am so glad I bought this collection and they will be staying on my kindle!If you haven't read any of Wayne Zurl's Sam Jenkins novels as yet - do!

"I felt a little ambivalent about this one. I liked aspects of it, such as the gorgeous Gavin, but the negativity of the heroine put me off. Her violent reaction to something which she assumed to be the case was way off base and the character of Vanessa just appeared to be in the story because ""the other woman"" needed to be there. Sometimes I felt Gavin could have done better for himself than Aubrey.It was okay but only that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322KKVSFHQAAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEGD70A#wasThisHelpful","R322KKVSFHQAAU","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel was so disappointing. I had it on my kindle for some time and decided I'd better read it, but I wish I hadn't. Second chance romances are always a risk, but this one was really unfortunate - to put it mildly.SPOILERS.**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************The heroine is a seemingly sensible woman who got dumped by an immature old playboy of a husband, who at no stage apologises for breaking up their 20 year marriage or it transpires, made any effort to tell his wife that he was unhappy. In time honoured fashioned, he leaps into bed with a younger woman and then comes home one day and says, ""I don't love you any more. I'm leaving you."" No explanation, no word of regret.The couple meet for their daughter's wedding on an island in the Bahamas where - wait for the first cliche - there's a mix-up over the heroine's room and she ""has"" to share a room with her ex-husband. We quickly find out that he is about to divorce the young woman (second cliche, she's a gold-digger) he dumped his wife for.Their daughter colludes with her father by not moving out of the cottage with her finance and sharing the room with her mother and not only that, this young madam chides her mother for making a fuss. It might upset the wedding.Clare's husband, Jim, comes across as an arrogant pig, flirting with waitresses and being everyone's friend as he tries to get back into the heroine's good graces and she of course, after a few cranky words, giggles and enjoys  his company. Really? A lot of winking and laughing and we are supposed to believe that this man will settle down and sincerely love the heroine again? Or could it be that he now knows that she is well set up financially as her business is doing well?The ending was expected but a disappointment and what a cliche. I would have expected more of this author, quite frankly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V8C8W4RFM0FE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJESQNQ#wasThisHelpful","R3V8C8W4RFM0FE","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel had a couple of disappointments in store for me. I know modern romance novels have explicit sex in them and expect that, but this was over the top. Pages and pages of explicit sex - I don't know how the main characters got to know each other again, because they were going at it like rabbits most pages after the first episode of connecting. I am not a prude and I do like to read sex scenes - who doesn't? - but when the plot appears to be there just to connect the sexual scenes, it gets boring pretty quickly.The other disappointment was that there was no ending. I sat through pages and pages of erotica with minimal characterisation except for the main female character, and no real depth to the story - and then for it not to finish...well, I won't be reading another in this series as they are obviously not standalone novels.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OYARZXSWHB00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPNRAF2#wasThisHelpful","R3OYARZXSWHB00","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you are busy bullying someone at school or denigrating a person's appearance in college, you need to be sure that person doesn't come back and ""get you."" A group of college students who think they are God's Gift to the opposite sex, make the mistake of playing a cruel joke on Lila Carmichael. Overweight and viciously repressed by her mad, religious maniac father, Lila is desperate to belong and to be seen as the incredibly talented actress she truly is. Her friend, Milli, knows how talented she is and persuades Lila to try out for the big play. Lila shows her talent and is cast in the lead role, something which doesn't sit well with Della the other female member of the theatre group.It all goes downhill from there...Fifteen years later, Lila is a huge star, a comedienne who has the world at her feet, fabulous wealth and a seemingly enchanted life. However, Lila has carried hatred and revenge in her heart all this time. Woe betide the ""friends"" who were in the theatre group! Each of these people has something they want from Lila, and they've all hit hard times. Surely Lila's invitation to the reunion of the theatre group at her house on a remote island means that she will help each one of them? Each with his or her own agenda, they arrive a the island full of hope, conveniently forgetting how they treated Lila in the past.It is amazing how a clever author can take a group of thoroughly horrible people and make a reader feel sorry for them, but C.S Lakin does just that. By the time the reunion is over, there is a lot of meaning to the saying (in essence) that if you seek revenge, you'd best dig two graves.""I was fascinated by this story and very interested in how it turned out. No spoilers, but this is a book worth reading for its clever writing, it's macabre denouement of the hapless group and the ultimate effect on them and on Lila.Well done indeed!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1283ZIU0OK6T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1926997859#wasThisHelpful","R1283ZIU0OK6T4","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an adoptee who has known all along that I was adopted, I just had to read this well written story.Forced adoptions were rife in Australia and only came to light in recent years.The story of Lilly, Megan and Sabina - now 37 and pregnant for the first time, only just learning of her adoption - is heart-wrenching and all too true.Right now on TV there is a series on the forced adoptions called Love Child and every bit of it is authentic. If you have seen the movie, Philomena, you will seethe at the injustice of the religious groups and government organisations who were involved in adoptions. Having read the story of the orphanage where I was parked in 1946 - well, the matron running that place would have had a lot to answer for if she had been alive today.Unfortunately, the revelations of people's original identities have come too late for most adoptees of my generation, but now that the official apology has been given, any adopted child has a right to approach his or her birth parent on reaching the age of 18 - if the parent is agreeable. Likewise, a parent is able to contact their child if the child is agreeable.The story of Lilly, Megan and Sabina is sad but up lifting.

"When one considers the millions of people in the world and the chance that a person can miss their soulmate, it is fortuitous that Vanessa Morgan could meet hers. While driving down the street one night, Vanessa sees a white cat with ginger markings sitting in the street. She and her partner at the time, Stephan, stop the car and take him home. So Avalon moves into their lives, a never-to-be-forgotten feline.From the moment they bring him home, it is apparent that Avalon, like his Vanessa, suffers from abandonment but Avalon takes it a step further, leaving no one in any doubt that he is a needy animal. Two other cats and a guinea pig are forced to move over and allow the Turkish Van cat to take over - and that he does much to the horror of the couple's friends and family, the landlady and the neighbours.This is a wonderful story of love, of compassion and of stamina - Avalon is not an easy housemate or indeed, soulmate. Eventually when Vanessa moves into her own apartment, Avalon reigns supreme. He becomes famous when he stars in the films made from Vanessa's books, but never does he allow her to forget that she is his.I cried and I laughed as, riveted by Avalon's story, Vanessa recounted her life with this remarkable animal. This is not just a ""cat story"" - it is an account of a true meeting of souls, a partnership beyond that of human to human. As a Spiritualist, I truly believe that Avalon was an old soul from one of Vanessa's former lives.A terrific read which I shall not forget. I will now be looking for Ms Morgan's other books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMWR89PMO5UCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XC1NE4I#wasThisHelpful","RMWR89PMO5UCO","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this collection yesterday and read - and continued to read - the books every chance I got. Griff, a young man whose development has been stunted because of a ten year old secret, becomes an animal expert in that he convinces everyone that he can talk to animals - specifically dogs and cats. He does this through learning their body language and observation of their surroundings. Before too long he is embroiled in several murder investigations which he manages to solve. In the background, a running sore in his life, is the knowledge that his sister, Susan, disappeared a decade ago, his mother is a reclause, his father died an alcoholic and his brother left home and barely considers himself part of the family. Griff's stunted social development is a direct result of his mother teaching him that he has to be wary of everything in the world and that he must hide himself in case he too is kidnapped.Griff meets Sheila Green, a detective, and starts to form a relationship with her, even though he doesn't know how a relationship works. As the on-going plot unfolds to Book 6, Griff finally gets to find out what happened to his sister and all is revealed, including a startling ending. This was the only aspect of the set I was disappointed in. The abruptness of the ending was a shock and leaves the series up in the air as far as I am concerned. There are some typos and a few inconsistencies but these aren't bad enough to worry me, because each of the murder mysteries were fascinating.I hope we get a final followup book to show us what happens to Griff! I think the author owes that to the reader for the abrupt but clever ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33H90JGCK46MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0YJZYQ#wasThisHelpful","R33H90JGCK46MC","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the first moment, this book pelts the reader headlong into a frightening chase. Lasting only one night and into the early morning, the plot concerns Allie, whose sister Carmen was murdered ten years previously and Beckard, a serial killer. Allie plans for ten years how to take Beckhard down. Finally she manages to lure him into her trap, but then things go horribly wrong...I loved this story. The incredibly fast pace, the confrontations between the adversaries all make for a wild ride.

"A most unusual novel, well written, which documents the lives of four people, three of whom knew each other at school and then meet at the end of their lives. The fourth, the wife of one of the couples, is just meeting the other couple.This is delightful in that the plot shows that romance and passion is not absent from older people's lives, it's all there simmering underneath the white hair and liver-spotted hands. The author was 79 when he wrote this, so he was in a good position to understand the problems and hopes of the elderly - and the well-kept secrets!!!This is a sensitive and humorous work and I just loved it.

"The beginning is pitiful and dark. The reader knows that things can only go bad in the long run. A little boy is forced to accompany his father - a well known actor - when he goes for a ""massage"" and a homosexual encounter. This happens regularly and sets the scene for the future.The characters are well drawn; the detectives are likable people in whom I invested concern.

As their stories unfold, there is an inexorable sense of dread in the manuscript. I wanted to yell, ""No, don't go there!""

"I didn't know anything about this author or his Dismas Hardy character until I got this book at a local market. Intrigued by the cover and synopsis - judging the contents by them as any good reader would - I delved into the book almost as soon as I got it home. For the next 24 hours I was riveted by the shenanigans of Dismas, his wife, Frannie and the carry-on of the political animals around them. Well, I shouldn't insult animals - these characters were go-getters of the first degree - ruthlessly ambitious..John Lescroart weaves a twisted tale of greed, lies and betrayals which had me reading in bed until the small hours and again until ten o'clock this morning. Dismas Hardy is a likable lawyer (yes, really!) whose wife is thrown into jail for contempt of court and insulting a judge. She is keeping a secret which is not hers, but which involves the safety of others. Hardy, of course, sets out to solve this mystery and find the murderer of three people.Needless to say, Lescroart has written a skillful, winding plot which culminates in satisfaction all round. The courtroom scenes are a riot, resulting in my wanting to cheer Hardy on.I see there are more Dismas Hardy novels available so I shall be looking for them in due course.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OEBVC97KRIQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BJVAPG#wasThisHelpful","R1OEBVC97KRIQ0","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's not much honor going around in this mob of characters. When I started this story, I immediately felt a deep sense of foreboding. Things were not going to end well for someone - and of course it didn't! The saying ""We reap what we sew"" springs to mind as I cast my mind back over this plot.Ben Taylor, a handsome, college boy - lustful, callous, seeking the main chance and a user - attracts the attention of a young, plain college girl, who becomes obsessed by him. Emotionally dependent, she makes friends with Ben and then allows herself to be used when he has nothing better on offer. Her friends hate him, understandably, and he is quite happy to take advantage of everything he can get.Finally, he experiences heartbreak and turns to Paige for consolation. She persuades him to meet her parents and then comes the surprise. Initially, torn between furthering his college education and the employment Paige's father offers him, Ben rather obviously comes down on the side of the money. However, to do him some credit, he knuckles down and honestly makes a go of the job. It isn't long however, before he reverts to type.The character of Ben is as horrible and go-getting as the character of Paige is manipulative and co-dependent. Neither of them are people whom I found hard to dislike. Then comes an even nastier piece of work - Cousin Evelyn - who of course is after Ben and needless to say, succeeds.The question which springs to mind, is Paige herself a victim or a predator? Evelyn is definitely a predator. So what's Ben? Well, he's definitely a licentious reptile who can't keep it in his pants, but how much prey is he, firstly to Paige's and then Evelyn's predatory schemes?There are a few redeeming features about Ben - he loves his daughter and feels sorry and guilty about his betrayals of his wife, but ultimately I believe the ending of this riveting novel - the ultimate betrayal - is justified.John King weaves a dark and cruel tale so skilfully that one forgets it was written by a man - but then why shouldn't it be? The book is written in the first POV - that of Ben. I felt just a little sorry for Paige, but kept wanting to shake her until her teeth rattled. I would definitely read another book by this author  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2894LKR07LOCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OX0TA8Q#wasThisHelpful","R2894LKR07LOCY","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Move over Lara Croft - you have competition!At first I thought this book was a little mad - well, that's okay, I like mad - but it took a chapter or two to get into the action and work out what was going on.  After I'd worked it out, this book was good fun.What woman doesn't wish she had super powers? Actually most women do and use them everyday, but stopping bullets with one's body is something most of us aspire to but can't achieve. These women do!  As a result of a medical experiment, two women, Megan and Trisha, attain super powers. They can fly, move in the blink of an eye, read minds, stop bullets - these women are invincible. Of course, where there are heroines, there has to be a baddie and this comes in the form of Malinkova and her mentor, who want to use one of the women's bodies to release a baddie from prison. This baddie is going to set off a bomb, so it's very important that he is out and about. Unfortunately, Malinkova - whilst in Megan's body  - falls for Megan's husband. Oh dear...How it all pans out is like a highly colourful cartoon-movie - one of those one sees the shorts of on TV and in the movies - all fire and lightning characters.Gary Henry has released the modern woman from everyday life and given her - and her daughters - a future of which we can all be proud.

"I thought I would like this book, but honestly - all the heartbreak and angst put a stop to that. This book had nothing in the way of joy or lightness.Inconsistencies in the relationship between Kyle, Jess and Colton were a stumbling block. Wilder couldn't have put more dramas into the novel if she'd tried. Drugs, cage fighting, inconsolable grief which results in alcoholism, miscarriages...and then there was endless pages of explicit sex.I cannot understand why books which are not labelled ""Erotica"" need to have such explicit details, endlessly toted out until I was skipping pages wishing it would all end. I don't mind a bit of sex in a novel, but oh dear...it almost seems as though modern romance authors put in pages of the sexual act when they can't come up with another part of the story - I'm talking about many romance authors here, not just Ms Wilder.Disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMW24EOQ7AI17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUPMC8C#wasThisHelpful","RMW24EOQ7AI17","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, in spite of the interesting cover, I didn't like this book. The characters - for me - are selfish, demanding and in the case of Sappho, so totally stupid as to be deserving of the ultimate betrayal by her husband, Gavin, her horrifyingly degenerate stepdaughter, Isobel, and her husband's former mother in law, the gloating, greedy, horrible Gwen.Arthur, Sappho's stepson,  is the only redeeming character in the book and it's a case of now you see him, now you don'tI won't go into the plot of the novel because that has been laid out in the synopsis and by other reviewers.The opening chapters are good, as Sappho arrives at her mother's house and leaves her diary and pages from her novel, then disappears physically until the end of the book. The mother and her boring boyfriend, Barnaby, swap opinions on psychological aspects of Sappho's and her step-family's lives in a long ramble, most of which I didn't understand or care about. Sappho's mother. Emily, of course reads the diary (it's a mother's duty, she says) written as a novel by Sappho -  and recounts it to Barnaby, whom she can''t decide to marry and spends most of the book debating whether to or not.As soon as Gavin moves into Sappho's house, stupid Sappho and helpless Laura (her secretary and as it is pointed out, only her employee) are undermined by the relentless Isobel, conniving Gavin and greedy Gwen.The whole plot might have worked if Sappho had a brain or a bit of gumption in her body, but as the author has chosen not to give her either of these attributes, then things went downhill from a few chapters in and never picked up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA72DOCTWLG1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VOLU9I#wasThisHelpful","RA72DOCTWLG1H","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rarely have I encountered and read a book which gets into the minds and hearts of the characters as well as this one. I am in awe of the author's skill in laying out an intricate and sensitive plot in which the characters are likable in spite of their obvious flaws.The character of Jack, the husband, is well drawn and strangely sympathetic when the back story reveals that he and Emmy have been trapped by their circumstances when they were too young to cope.That Jacks' solution and the result forces Emmy stand up for herself and fight for her marriage made me hate Jack for bailing out in such a manner - no spoilers!However,  in spite of the bad light in which this places Jack, the situation has resolved itself by the time we meet the couple and the gorgeous, supposedly laid-back Duncan Grier. Duncan has his own demons to put to rest, not the least of which is the restriction he feels in his personal, social and professional life. Wanting to break out of the mold into which he has settled is bringing Duncan's past to light, something with which he cannot cope without help - Emmy's help.The ending, where Emmy makes her choice, is dramatic and ultimately satisfying  :)I couldn't put this novel down and would love to read more by this author.Congratulations, and very well done indeed!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17AD9J472CLM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THRCMDA#wasThisHelpful","R17AD9J472CLM0","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I liked this novel and thought it was a pleasant read. The characters were likable - perhaps too perfect in some cases - and the main character very prone to jumping to conclusions. The hero - as per tradition - was gorgeous, but I would have liked him to be a little harder to catch! I thought his occupation was delightful and full marks to the author for bringing something different to the plot.The writing could have been much tighter and the author or editor should have cut out some of the repetition - there were instances of Tracy going working the same thoughts over and over - and over - which is understandable but she flew off at tangents very easily -  and there could have been a lot more tension generated. IMO, the author could have made a lot more of the plot with more depth and mystery. The solution - no spoilers! - came almost too easily, but I did like the ending and what it implied for the relationships between the characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FYK3QX72J0SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L1LISZQ#wasThisHelpful","R1FYK3QX72J0SM","A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

At first I laughed at the one-liners even though many were sarcastic, but after awhile I began to get tired of the supposedly light-hearted comments. I realise that the character is trying hard to cope with being left with an Asperger's child - and I couldn't imagine how difficult that must be - but in the end I don't think she liked Merlin much even though she couldn't let him go and try to be a little normal - and the ""twist"" toward the end was totally expected.

"Bea Abbott and Ellie Quick - whose stories I love reading - have a lot in common - even Bea has a recalcitrant adult too. This is one of the better ""cozies"" around and set in the UK a country I love. I confess I got this book at our local library - just as well because the kindle version is pretty pricey.It was a little hard to fill out the survey at the beginning of this review, particularly the mood. I picked ""hopeful"" because it seemed the best to describe the plot. Okay, so there were things happening that were dark but because this genre - for want of a better word - is ""cozy"" they don't seem half as bad compared to a really murky murder mystery.Winston was the sanest, apart from Bea, who seems to have an endless supply of biscuits, coffee and tea to feed everyone who arrives at her door. The house is like the Tardis, a room available whenever anyone needs one!I liked all the characters, although a couple were a little stereotyped, realised what was happening to Briscoe about halfway through, but felt the ending could have been wrapped up with less telling rather than showing.

"We live in a rural location, so we keep a can of regular whole milk Nido (basically, whole milk with some extra iron & vitamin C) in our fridge to mix up when we run out of milk & the one local shop is closed. It's rich & creamy, with the right flavor and mouthfeel--certainly better than a Parmelat backup. My toddler is happy to drink it & I'm happy to use it on cereal or cook with it.This stuff is different. I was hoping for regular Nido with a fortification directed at toddlers. Instead, it's your basic overly sweet fakey-tasting formula. While it's not as overtly metallic tasting as your average American formula, I tastes nothing like milk. My 3-year-old asked ""What is this?"" after taking a sip, then asked for water instead. She's not overly picky: she's consumed everything from whole pasteurized to raw farm milk to ultrapasteurized lowfat to dry milk with equal gusto. But even a 3-year-old can tell this is ""not milk."" And a quick glance at the ingredients confirms it's the usual junky formula stuff: notfat dry milk with oil, sugar, conr syrup & a host of other make-do junk.I've had a good experience in the past with the Nido brand, and so mistakenly assumed this would be actual (if dehydrated) food, not an over-engineered food-like product. Oh well.If you kid likes formula and sweetened milk, they might like this. If they drink regular milk & not a ton of sugar-processed stuff, they'll probably find it off-putting. I sampled it, and while it was noewhere near as gross as toddler enfamil, it still had a weird, overly-sweet flavor & greasy mouth feel. Luckily, at least this stuff isn't terribly tinny, so we can salvage it a pinch on cereal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N1RTYHFQQUCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LVDDFA#wasThisHelpful","R1N1RTYHFQQUCX","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I happened to have some regular kisses on hand to compare with these. Physically, they're much larger (see picture), and they're almost twice as heavy (9g ea vs. 5g for the regular). The Deluxe ones are wrapped in textured gold foil with a tan and brown printed tissue paper.The flavor is completely different. The standard Hershey's chocolate has it's place (namely, s'mores, peanut butter kisses, and trick-or-treat bags), and I've certainly eaten my share, but let's face it: it's the bottom tier. Sure, if it's WWII and a bunch of them fall from they sky, you're psyched; but you don't go seeking it out in modern life. It's the chocolate of last resort, fine if you need a fix & only have access to a gas station or vending machine.The chocolate in Kisses Deluxe is much nicer--creamier, and none of the hard waxy texture of a Hershey bar, nor the chalkiness of a Kiss. Besides the toasted hazelnut classing it up, it's got crispies that look and taste like the shell of a Ferrero Rocher. In fact, that's the overall flavor profile her, but with a bit less of the airy crunch and more chocolate--a good thing, in my book.The price is decent (about $4 bag at current price). Btw, my bag had 14, not 15. I'd put them in the same product category as those little bags of Ghiradelli squares--the packaging & product quality are about the same.

"This size is great in the freezer for bulk fruit & veg, bought cheaply in season then frozen in a single layer on a silpat-covered baking sheet, then transferred to large bags for use in the winter when prices climb. Ditto pre-making hors d'ouvres or cookie dough balls for make-ahead convenience.The seal is liquid-tight, making these bags excellent for freezing soups and batters flat for freezer storage efficiency. Use one of these--love it & it works for sandwich to gallon size bags--for hands-free bag filling: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040LU3Y8. I'd recommend no more than 3 quarts batter or soup--using the full gallon capacity makes filling and sealing pretty dodgy, and makes flat freezing less efficient, because they're puffier. Fill all your bags, remove as much air as possible, then freeze a stack of them on a baking sheet (stack no more than 3 high for max stability). You can label near the zipper seal and face them all the same way for best orientation for reading a nice stack in the freezer.The slider style bag is critical for liquid ingredients, keeping filling and sealing tidy and convenient--you don't want to be fumbling with a bag full of soup. The Hefty brand is much better than store brand sliders, and is sturdy enough to be reusuable (rinse well in hot water with a little soap for greasy contents, and dry on a rack dryer--mine is made of tinker toys).  If you're reusing for liquids, test the seal first with a quart of water and save yourself a mess. These aren't engineered for a lot of reuse/abuse, but they're certainly reusable with a bit of care.The bulk price on Amazon (currently $14.99, with a 15% off coupon) with or without coupon, is comparable to my local Target & better than the local grocery store. Prices fluctuate wildly on Amazon, though, so it's best to keep an eye out and make sure the value is still good when you order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NMQ50UQ6UTEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUJ5UZC#wasThisHelpful","R1NMQ50UQ6UTEG","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is basically a silky Hoisan-based sauce that could probably be easily produced yourself, but I like the mindless convenience of it for a quick dinner with whatever meat & veggies I need to use up in my fridge. I typically use 3x ormore the volume of veggies called for on the packet--whatever I have on hand--but I always include a can of water chestnuts, which give it the right texture. You can use raw meat, ground or diced or leftover cooked meat (pork, chicken, beef & shrimp are all good), and it comes out nicely no matter what. It's also good without meat at all, though it's less filling, so extra chopped peanuts will help beef it up. We prefer to use interior nappa cabbage leaves over lettuce, as it's sturdier with better crunch. We also like it with brown rice, on the side or in the wraps.I feel a little sheepish about using this kind of product, but it's a time saver, inexpensive & is an easy way to add a lot of veggies to your diet or use up rando odds & ends in your fridge that aren't enough for a meal on their own","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHI18JAWCIQ0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HGRWEE#wasThisHelpful","RHI18JAWCIQ0K","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"True to its ""intensive healing"" claim. Without a good cream, my hands are a wreck year-round, and especially bad in winter. Most drugstore brands are a waste of time or require too-frequent application. This (like the Kiehl's I normally use) is a once-a-day cream, even with frequent handwashing. It keeps my dry hands smooth and soft, and saves my dry feet from their natural, scaly monkey-foot appearance.It's definitely a quality cream. My only complaint is the slightly coated feel your hands get about 10 minutes after application. I don't notice it on my feet, but on my hands, its distracting enough to rinse them (which fixes it immediately without reducing its overall effects). This is a small thing, but annoying, especially if you're driving or otherwise without access to running water.Just a side note, the ""exfoliating"" descriptor made me expect a cream more like the old Pretty Feet and Hands, a cream used to loosen and rub off dead skin.

"I've been using two ScoopFree boxes for 5 years with very few problems, so the Scoopfree box is my benchmark. We refill the ""disposable"" trays for several months, so the major expense is the litter and/or trays, but frankly I've been pleased with crystal littler over clumping. I know YMMV by household, but with our 2 small cats, the crystal litter works great. We've only had this one in use for 3 weeks, so I don't feel confident with that 4th star just yet, but I'll update after a year if it's still going strong.This box is easy to assemble but not easy to move (the waste basket won't stay attached), so assemble where you intend to use it.Here are the things it has going for it over the Scoopfree (Mostly it boils down to the litter itself, not the box, which is why I can't rate this a clear winner yet)--You can use any litter, a huge plus for some people, and I haven't done a side-by-side comparison (usage rates and time are different), but I suspect clumping will be much cheaper, as there is much more market competition. You could also use flushable or natural litter, which is a definite benefit in my book--While still ugly, the colors aren't as obnoxious as the Scoopfree's purple (though they did come out with neutral replacement accessories)--No trays, so easier to clean if you don't toss the tray--the collection system is also tidier and less prone to spilling, without or without the liners (I haven't been able to find them)--quieter, at least initially (3 weeks isn't really a workout). If your box is in your bedroom, this may matter to you--Better odor control for a shared box. We have one box per cat in our home, but I've been using this at my mom's house while my dad's undergoing chemo because there's already so much more to do without worrying about the litterbox, so her two smallish cats have been sharing the box. She had them share a scoopfree in the past and thinks this does a better job with the smell.--May do a better job with urineDownside vs. Scoopfree-Doesn't automatically rake after each use. Instead, you can select various time frames for it to rake. Hourly is an option and would probably be sufficient for most cats (though less so for the humans stuck with smelling their stinky poop until it's raked)-Needs to be topped off and emptied way more frequently, because the clumping litter really adds to the overall volume of the waste. But this will still be WAY better than a traditional box if that's what you're used to.-Unknown product life. This is a newer product without a long-term use history.Bottom line: So far, this seems to be a thoughtfully designed machine with some real benefits over the ScoopFree. Time will tell how well the motor and overall integrity holds up. Since the initial price is close, I would need to see at least a year of product life ($10/month) for it to be a good value. (With 5+ yrs of use, my ScoopFrees have amortized to about $1.50 a month and counting.)UPDATE (reposted from a comment question)You have to clean out is one a lot more frequently than the Scoop Free--probably once a week or more with one small cat vs once a month with the scoop free--because the clumping liter means you're scooping pee as well as poop. But it is way easier to clean out, since you're just dumping the waste instead of the whole box, and the little trash can just unhooks from the frame. On ours, the liner has stayed in place and I've just dumped the waste into the outside garbage.So it requires more day-to-day attention (much less than a traditional box, and none of the gross sifting), but it's not a terrible chore.The regular clumping litter also seems to track a LOT more than the crystal, which is a huge downside to me. The scoop free requires no day-to-day attention, but the end of the litter's life is stinkier, I think.I think ultimately, you have to weigh whether the mess of tracked litter is a bigger deal to you or a somewhat stinky week at the end of the litter's life (which you could avoid by being less lazy than I about changing the litter) is a bigger deal. We have a large home and out of the way boxes, so less tracking and less attention beats better overall control and more attention. If you have a smaller home or apartment & the box is close to your living space, this box might be a better fit (or changing the ScoopFree at 3 weeks instead of 4).My mom prefers this & clumping litter to the Scoop Free (which I encouraged her to buy in the past & she has since abandoned). From what I've seen, I'm still happier with my Scoop Free, however.In the end, this box (easier to clean) with crystal litter (empty less often because it's not scooping pee, as it is with clumping) could be the perfect machine for us--but I'm reserving judgment until I see how long it lives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQDC7GBGRPSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DSMRDE#wasThisHelpful","RKQDC7GBGRPSO","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on other reviews, perhaps there is a lot of variation in the batches (read: flaky QC). But mine were inedibly bland. I suffered through 3 pointless jars, then chucked the rest in the garbage. Seriously bland. With other brands, even Kraft, which is not exactly known as a powerhouse of bold flavor, I typically use prepared horseradish 1:3-4 with ketchup for cocktail sauce and about the same with mayo for roast beef sandwiches for a medium zip. With this stuff, even 1:1 had no bite, and trying to use more than that gave an acrid flavor and yucky mouth feel.I'm a cheapskate, so tossing 9 jars into the garbage with no regrets (except that I didn't do it sooner) shows how disappointing this was.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BGO4EEKQIGNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006UCUG1A#wasThisHelpful","R1BGO4EEKQIGNS","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are perfectly good cupcake papers, and the colors do stay reasonably bright (not very opaque, so the light ones look much better with light cakes than chocolate), but contrary to the description, you do need to use a muffin tin unless you're making a pull-apart cupcake cake and you want a mostly continuous shape--or you don't mind misshapen or very flat cupcakes. They won't just collapse, but they're not rigid enough to maintain a tight cupcake shape and form a nice crown without a tin.I baked them on a sheet pan, spaced the distance apart of a typical muffin tin, and got the results picutured. I used exactly 1/4 cup batter (I use a level disher scoop) and the new  Pillsbury Purely Simple cake mix that's basically just pantry staples without all the chemical additives--makes great tasting cake, btw. I didn't take pictures of the earlier batch, but the same batter in the cups in a muffin tin looked lovely and nicely crowned, so the batter is not the culprit.For a pull-apart cake, I'd space them so the edges are just touching, and you should get a nice solid mass.Pics show baking without tin, and chocolate cupcakes baked in the 2 colors.Overall, nice cups, WAY  better than the pastel grocery store cups, not quite as hood as Wilton or other specialty cups.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A27DS8ZA9VLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZR4TL0E#wasThisHelpful","R3A27DS8ZA9VLA","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Setup (download the app, follow the onscreen instructions) was easy on my iPad. While I find most of the extra info (bmi, water weight, etc.--and bone weight? can't seem to find any useful and consistent parameters for this anywhere) extraneous, I do love that every time I hop on the scale, all my deets are getting recorded and sent up in the ether for me to review later. Will this amount to weight loss? Probably not for me, since just knowing my weight doesn't help much if I'm still overeating, but it's fun and allows me to track weight to life situations with zero effort on my part.If you're within about 3 pounds apart, the scale will automatically see a second person as a different use and prompt setup, tracking them separately, which was pretty cool.It totally looks like an Apple product, or something from Sleeper or 2001. You don't see the display until you activate it by stepping on or tapping it.I also love that you can nudge it and get the temperature and humidity in the room, as we're in an old building and our sole thermostat is 100 feet away down a long hall.Word to the wise, on the app: if you're a stocky male with a few extra pounds, odds are good it's going to call you obese. My partner, who is far less overweight than me, but short and stocky (and also a dude; so the bmi parameters are tougher), was called out as obese by the app, which put him in a bad mood for the next day. :) I don't think anyone human would call him obese, but the app sure did. Pro tip: if the app calls your partner obese and he's not, especially if you're the fatter one and it generously pegged you as simply overweight, do no laugh and laugh and laugh. It will not improve his mood.One tech quirk that may have been a fluke: I did notice a lag in my records when our DSL failed for about a week, even when I repeatedly synched.

"I'm not a huge jerky eater, and I often find the specialty flavors overly-sweet, but I was totally into this. I didn't know what to expect of pork jerky, but this really tasted like bulgogi! Obviously, it's not a juicy steaming charred pile of meaty wonderfulness, but for dried meat, it's a pretty darn tasty approximation!I gobbled it up in 2 servings that seemed pretty modest, so I think the 3 servings the package alledges are wishful thinking.

"While this book's main focus (an of course the author's own area of expertise) is on high-achieving professional women, it also addresses many more universal issues that contribute to the awkward struggle between family and career, and differences in expectation and treatment of women and men.I'm a feminist who downshifted my career ambitions (or rather, realized they were more a social construct than my own genuine ambitions) well before starting a family in my early 40s, but the work/caregiving/partner struggle has still been a genuine challenge. This book demonstrates how the women's career/family balance problem really is fundamentally a care problem, a more significant social problem outside of simple workplace sexism. It also really opend my eyes to subtle shifts in view and language could really help address the issue, and how my own gender biases and presumptions have probably worked against me. I can also look back with a little shame about my past treatment and views of co-workers with family obligations when I was a child-free.I really like that the book addresses the broader problem of care generally, including elder care and sick loved ones. I'm getting to the age where my friends and I are beginning to worry after and care for our parents, and care of older family members is something the current generation of workers will really struggle with.I do wish there was more on offer here for working class women (as a very small business owner, I'm not quite working class, but the virtues and pitfalls of corporate or professional life don't really resonate with me), but the author is wisely sticking with the world she knows, and pointing out that even the limited flexibility of many career women is a luxury far out of the reach of poor and working-class women (and, I might add, the growing body of self-employed, contactors and freelancers with a more comfortable life but little or no social or economoc safety net).I especially appreciated the practical points in the end chapters about starting conversations and examining your own biases.Personally, as someone off the driven career track, much of the book's specifics don't apply to my current situation, but I found it a worthwhile read for the overall thoughtful message and the shift it brought to my perspective. I wish I could get my dad to read it. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R159WKU2NH0TBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812994566#wasThisHelpful","R159WKU2NH0TBQ","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm generally disgusted by canned dog food (my parents feed canned and I want to barf whenever I encounter it), but this is far less stinky than your average canned food, and I have to admit it is nice to have a little something to offer my good boy as an easy doggy junky treat on occasion. These come in pulltop cans and the contents (big stable cubes with a scattering if rice and thin gravy) slide out willingly without the aid of a utensil to wash, so you don't have to deal with throwing up a little in your mouth to feed it. Consequently, the can also rinses easily, so it's simple to recycle the can without a big production or the guilt of throwing away a recyclable.I can't get on board with feeding cans as primary food--my 50 lb Shorthaired's recommended dose is 2 cans, way too expensive (and messy, and packaging-intensive) vs kibble.

"Great for ""beach hair"" or messy Frenchy buns. Brings out the wave and gives hair definition for tousled hair, and gives some definition and refinement to a messy French bun or updo. I like to apply it to dry hair, then tousle or scrunch and let dry. The updo works best if you apply, scrunch, then go ahead and put your hair up before letting it dry.

The chocolates were still melted into a single glob at the bottom of each package instead of the 4 small nuggets. I've had other chocolates delivered in warmer weather, but I think the upright tube packaging makes them more suseptible to melting. The melted and reset chocolate wasn't horrible, but the texture and flavor were a bit off.

"Like the other Avery chalkboard labels, the package shows these in an inappropriate, single-use application. These are more useful in a situation where you want to be able to change the label wording as needed, and be able to remove them readily if necessary.I like them for labeling snack and pantry jars--they adhere well but remove if necessary, and readily accept both regular chalk and bistro chalk pens. In both cases, there is a bit of faint ghosting when you wipe off the writing, but it's so subtle that you can't readily see it when you write over it. However, this shape isn't as handy or attractive for container labels as some of the other styles. This shape is a very tricky to remove without deforming the edges, so the ""removable"" part applies less here than with some other shapes (yes, you can remove it, but you may not be able to reuse it).They have a nice texture to grab the chalk (especially nice with the chalk markers, which like to smear or smooth surfaces), and they're thicker than chalkboard Contact paper (which I still prefer slightly because it's blacker, cheaper, and can be cut into whatever shapes you like), which is nice both for application and removal.My main problem with the Avery labels is the price, currently almost $2 per label--5 - 8X the price of other die-cut chalkboard labels sold on Amazon and twice the cost of a roll 18"" x 6-foot Contact chalkboard sticker paper.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31EJNWQY7FTF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7VEN62#wasThisHelpful","R31EJNWQY7FTF8","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Looking at the ingredients, it's a mild irritant with a scent that is unappealing to animals like dogs with 50x our scent power (it's rather bland to the human nose). Seems to dissuade our persistent dog from fussing too intently where it has been applied, at least when it's pretty fresh (we haven't had any rain to test it & the forecast is dry for a while yet).I wish they made a product that turned off dogs but not cats, to keep the dog from chasing rabbits into the hay shed, but left the cats contentedly mousing in the same spots. As it is, I'm reluctant to use it everywhere I'd like to discourage the dog.One caveat: if you have chickens, keep them in while you apply it. I don't think they'd gorge on it, and I don't think it would do more harm than mildly irritate them, but I discovered my chickens getting very excited and running towards me when they saw/heard me sprinkling the shaker can.

I don't like to wash my hair too much, as it tends to get dry, and I find my hair generally looks better & styles much better when it's dirty.

"This is decent mid-range chocolate, inoffensive but unremarkable. The current price on amazon ($24, or nearly 5 bucks a bar) is outrageous.I like the old-fashioned lettering and the golden paper wrappers, which make me think of Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. However, the paper wrappers pose a problem if you're ordering when it's hot. If the chocolate melts (mine did), instead of just getting a deformed bar like you would with a plastic sealed wrapper, you get a mess of chocolate embedded with metallic paper, not awesome if you have fillings and you miss a piece of the foil while you're picking it out. My package was sitting sideways as it melted, so all the bars were deformed and mushed down to one side of the box, looking pretty ugly (important since this is a gift box) and leaving a big gap that made it look like someone had filched a bar from the box.Some chocolate survives melting and resetting well, but this does not. Not only was it blobbly with no discernable squares, but the reset chocolate was permeated with--let's call it ""chocolate rust""--that white stuff that forms when chocolate melts and resets, or just sits for a long time--in a strange globular pattern, and the texture was crumbly and unappealing.Hershey's chocolate is not exactly ""the good stuff"" but it's usually good for a respectable chocolate fix. But this product is exceptionally poor in shipping, so I'd be very reluctant to send it as a gift, as the results under stress are very poor. Combined with the high price (~$30/lb), I'd opt for a different product if you're shipping anywhere near the warm months. I'm in Kansas in September, so it's not typically dangerous weather for chocolate (I've had other chocolate shipments in the last week or so with no deterioration, though maybe they got luckier with overcast days or a cooler spot on my porch), but since you can't predict the heat of a mailbox or porch, I'd avoid this until mid-fall thru early spring--or an even shorter window if you're shipping in the southwest.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F5M4MYOFA1B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CLE2ZS#wasThisHelpful","R1F5M4MYOFA1B9","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The easy align self laminating labels are such an improvement over past-self laminating labels that require you to pisition the first label, then try to carefully place the clear plastic cover by hand. It was hard to get it perfectly lined up on the first try and impossible to reposition if you screwed up. These ones make it super easy to make a perfect, even lamination, with a thin, crystal clear cover and no bubbles.The label is perforated to make the alignment easy. You print your sign, half the page, then peel off the backing from the laminated side, then use the perforation to cleanly and evenly fold the lamination right over the printed label. Perforating instead of just scoring means it folds down very flat withoit resistance.These are large labels, so they require a little more care than the little ones. To get a perfect seal, I held up the outside edge of the laminating side as I slowly pressed down from the folded side, smoothing back and forth across the releasing the edge once it's smoothed out a little past half way.These stick well and are great for door signs and labeling equipment in technical and utility rooms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IJ6IYDBVSFT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XOJ9S70#wasThisHelpful","R3IJ6IYDBVSFT2","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Somehow, this conditioner made the gray almost invisible. I don't get why--it's not colored, just looks like normal, off-white conditioner.

"I've used different Self-laminating labels before, but they were fussy and required you to line up the laminating cover by hand--hard to get them perfectly centered, and easy to mess up the adhesive with your fingers. These solve both problems. Each sheet is half printable labels, half clear laminate covers. The center of the sheet is perforated to easily fold precisely down the middle and perfectly align the covers over the printed labels.Using a printer, you must print a full sheet at a time, as the paper isn't meant to withstand repeated trips through the machine. But you can laminate the labels equally well either all at once or individually, so if you were hand-printing, you could use just those you need.They print crisply and wipe clean, and look nicer than generic label maker labels. They work well on handwashable containers like spice or pantry storage jars (I wouldn't risk soaking, though), and I'm even using them inside my fridge on shelves and door cubbies, in hopes that others will observe my organization efforts if my ""system"" is clear. :)With the washable surface, they's also be nice for labeling homemade cleaners or beauty products in plain containers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMQI1C83FHU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XOJ9SIE#wasThisHelpful","R2EMQI1C83FHU2","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in an old reinforced concrete high school building, so I'm using several extenders to get wifi into the building's numerous dead zones. So far, this is the first non-Apple extender I've tried that was fast and breezy to set up, and required zero fiddling or workarounds to make it function perfectly.The setup process is basically: plug it in halfway between your router and desired signal location, connect to Linksys network when it appears in your list of networks, go to the setup url and either relocate the extender (I needed to.move it over one plug) or proceed with the setup, which is just selecting your network and entering the password. In minutes, I had a strong signal and could stream movies is a spot in the building which was formerly an wifi black hole, and a good strong signal extends rooms away.I also like that there's a passthrough plug, since extenders are usually space hogs, and there are never enough plugs.It's roughly the same price ($7 more at the moment), but I feel, a better signal than my Apple Airport Express units. The Apple might be a better choice if you are really strapped for plugs--even with the pass-through, it's bulky and it's shoulders will block other plugs in a 3-prong adapter, for instance. But in spots where I'm not trying to shoehorn an extra 3-4 plugs into my outlet, I think I'd pick this instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZSFYZQNLL9K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20YA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZSFYZQNLL9K7","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm just a casual camper, so this is definitely the nicest sleeping bag I've used. It's lightweight and really well made.I'm a chubby 5'3"" and it was plenty roomy for my fat butt. It was also long/roomy enough for my 33-lb toddler to cozy in at the foot end--a nice bonus--and the excess fabric under the zip made a perfect pillow for her, too. In a pinch, this bag could work as a double-ended tandem sleeper for two small kids (or a toddler and a short adult--just as long as neither of you is a kicker. ;))I love the foot zipper--cools you down quickly if you get overheated, and at about a foot from the bottom, it's positioned high enough to be useful for shorter people. And it also really does let you walk around without getting out of the bag--I can see this being great for cold nights, migrating from the campfire to the tent.I found it a bit awkward to zip from the inside due to the draft tube/flap (designed to block air leaks) that runs the length of the zipper, but it's not a huge hardship.Kept loose, the hood is roomy enough to feel cozy but not constricting, or on warmer nights, to serve as a pillow. Super light, just a couple pounds, and I think a compression sack could make it half its size (which is already pretty compact).And this is goofy, but I LOVE  the little phone/ipod pocket inside at about chest level--very handy to have phone, keys, etc (or stash or cigs, if that's your persuasion) , secure and at the ready--and no zipper to fiddle with, but an overlapping flap (kind if like a pillow sham) to keep stuff from falling out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33OVZSD4D4RBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCFIR0#wasThisHelpful","R33OVZSD4D4RBJ","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aside from the strange regional divisions (more on that in a moment), this is a wonderful, fun, educational and beautiful game. You might be able to push the lower limit of the age bracket for kids who are bright and enthusiastic about animals, but it's definitely fun and engaging enough for much older kids & adults.I love the board--a gorgeous, oversized board (6 folding panels instead of the usual 4) on linen textured stock, featuring a topographical world map, with a numbered track around it for keeping score, and little panels for betting on different aspects of the various animals' features and habitats. I love the simple, colorful wooden markers used to bet and keep score. The animal info cards are oversided, attractive, and ample. And while the rules are a bit involved to get a handle on, they make sense and are easy to follow once you get going. I love that there's a gambling aspect as well as pure knowlege--that makes it great fun to guess, and easier to keep the scores close if one or more players aren't really knowledgeable about animals, but are good guessers/strategizers.The only thing puzzling about the game are the very strage geographical divisions on the map. I can't speak to the other continents, but the divisions for North America are strange, both in areas they encompass--which cover a weird swath of unrelated habitats--but also in name. ""California"" covers the whole West Coast; ""Central America"" includes a good chunk of Mexico; ""Missississippi"" is everything south of the Great Lakes on the Eastern half of the US (so: Florida and Michigan in the same region); and New England is in ""Newfoundland."" The southwestern desert seems to be lumped in with the Rockies (two wildly different habitats).

"My go-to hand cream is Kiehl's, which I still prefer to this, because of it's lighter, medicinal scent.This cream has a dimethicone (silicone polymer) base that gives it that characteristic slippery-but-not-greasy feel as you rub it in.  After a few seconds, it absorbs, giving you skin an emollient barrier that makes your skin feel immediately softer and slows drying.I feel it softens as well as Kiehl's and lasts as well, but it does give my hands a slightly shinier appearance that, in my opinion, makes them look older. That might just be a personal association with gradmas and hand creams; I don't know.What I don't like is the very strong, long-lasting floral scent. In its defense, it is actually a very NICE scent--not cheap or synthetic smelling; just not what I'm looking for in a hand cream (neutral to herbal is my preference). It is a pleasant, old-fashioned scent. Almost reminds me of rosepetal jelly.

"I love this pressure cooker with a couple of caveats. My points of comparison are my other Maximatic electric pressure cooker (8qt, love love love), my giant Presto 23-qt pressure canner (conventional stove top) and two other conventional pressure cookers I've been using for years.For everyday use (I use my electric cookers 1-3x a week; the stovetop ones only get hauled out during canning season), you can't beat an electric pressure cooker. You can cook things so freaking fast (tender pulled pork in 75 minutes, a roast in an hour, dried beans--without soaking--in under 30 minutes, chicken in 10 minutes, brown rice in 23 minutes, and lots of other dishes you wouldn't think of pressure cooking--get the America's Test Kitchen or Hip Pressure Cooking cook book), without having to hover around and fiddle with the burner or risk overcooking. I almost always use the time settings instead of the preprogrammed settings. I seriously could not manage without this appliance. Before I got an electric pressure cooker, I only used my pressure cookers to can and for the occasional stew. I'm just too easily distracted for them.Vs. my larger Maximatic, this machine is prettier and better suited to standard pressure cooking recipes (almost universally written for 6qt cookers. The only things I dislike (I'd really rather give it 4.5 stars) are that the cover comes off completely (the cover folds open on the larger machine, so you don't make a mess on your counter or have to struggle to find an open spot on a cluttered counter--could be a PITA if you have a tiny kitchen; and that the bowl tends to slide around inside the machine. This doesn't matter when you're pressure cooking, but I typically saut aromatics or brown meats in the pan to build flavor before pressure cooking; or finish sauces, etc., after pressure cooking. So I'm almost always stirring at some point in the preparation. And when you stir stuff in the bowl, the bowl wants to spin around in the machine. The good news is that you can actually hold the edge of it in place without a potholder--the heat is all at the bottom, and the edges of the top stay rather cool, probably because it's such a tall pot.I've been using my other maximatic machine weekly for almost 2 years, so the nonstick pan is pretty far from nonstick now, though still perfectly serviceable--no flaking or scaling. But the stainless pot on this one will give it a much longer life. It is very heavy gauge stainless and has the measuring marks stamped into the sides, very handy. The lid is also heavy stainless--it reminds me of a conventional pressure cooker lid more than the larger machine's lid, which reminds me more of a rice cooker (both in the weight and that it folds open).As for pressure canning, this pot will hold 4 pint jars, somewhat less than the bigger machine, but still very handy for small batch canning--I love it for pressure canning leftover soups, stews, and chili (saving freezer space), canning dried beans (instructions here: http://amatterofpreparedness.blogspot.com/2010/02/i-dont-have-time.html), and canning small batches of produce (usually something in my CSA share I won't have time to eat). You can also use canning jars to render fat (tallow, lard & schmaltz) without the stink and mess and splatter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNGRIMQBDMYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZJOGBO#wasThisHelpful","R1BNGRIMQBDMYN","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I prefer the 3M fastener to velcro for 3 reasons: it stays tidier (the loop side isn't fuzzy and therefore doesn't get as ragged and worn as velcro), the sound (the 3M type kind of clicks together and has a quieter, less obnoxious sound when separated (I know this sounds crazy, like Jerry Seinfeld's dad, but having a sleeping baby has made me more aware of surprisingly loud sounds :)), and the adhesive is better. They're also easier to keep clean in dusty situations, and the rolls are more uniform (there are always weird bumps and wrinkles in my adhesive backed Velcro rolls).3M knows adhesive.  I've never found a velcro adhesive I really liked. Either they were too gummy and had seepage along the edges that made everything dirty and gross, or they didn't adhere as well to certain surfaces (particularly fabric--and sew-on is not always practical).I like that the 3M fasteners are targeted to specific applications (read the description to make sure you're getting your best adhesive), as I usually have a specific project in mind when I buy a roll. I have several half-rolls of Velcro brand that didn't work out for the project I had in mind, so I like that I can get a better idea up front with the 3M. As with velcro, the rolls are a *much* better value than the chintzy little cardboard backed hang-tag packages also on offer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y5ZS2LG4NXPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OXK3YY#wasThisHelpful","R1Y5ZS2LG4NXPL","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It covers both the highlights and serious lowlights of a young Jewish kid's coming of age in an orthodox community. The subject matter can be weird and raunchy (in that what's on a preteen's or teenager's mind is probably always pretty weird and raunchy) it's always oddly sweet--his sex fantasies are as apt to include marriage and family dinners as porn-fueled banging.I loved getting a glimpse into a totally different world (and that he explained it so well--for instance, I had no idea that the bar mitzvah Torah readings were from scrolls without punctuation or vowels--give you a whole new appreciation for the performance). But I also loved that in the end, kids are kids, and while Eytan's childhood experience would be pretty much the opposite of mine (non-professional middle class/suburban/public school/lapsed Catholic/only child/school-loving/female/with a working mom--and a decade earlier), teen angst and idiotic ideas about sex and romance are universal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQY4OO64TQAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067227#wasThisHelpful","ROQY4OO64TQAT","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While it's annoying, I does encourage me to wash it off my hands after application, and it reminds me to wash it off the kiddo when we get back inside. (I don't think it's strictly necessary, but seems like a good idea with chemicals.)The substance is just too viscous for the pump it's in, but the pump seems to loosen up after a few weeks and be easier to use. Initially, it was really, really hard to pump. I had to hold the pump with one hand and pump with the other. After about a quarter of the bottle was gone, it was easier to pump, though a bit stiff.It is a bit messy, as you'll need to spread it around, as it's a thick milky liquid that comes out in heavy drops instead of a fine mist, so best to apply it indoors so you can wash your hands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAE5WPO8JEXFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J1IS5U#wasThisHelpful","RAE5WPO8JEXFD","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is fine for cookies, but has ruined the texture of everything leavened (be it with yeast, eggs, or baking powder/soda) I've made with it. Anything leavened will be too moist and gummy. Sweet (sticky) brown rice flour & tapioca starch are the first 2 ingredients, which explains the awful gumminess.Since cookies & brownies are easy to make gluten-free, and pretty much any non-wheat flour, including just plain old oats zipped in the food processeor, will work, I can't really give it any credit for producing acceptable cookies.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IMA9DNFMVPMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGIQJV8#wasThisHelpful","R3IMA9DNFMVPMU","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only problem with this cooler is that the water spout opens when you pull on it (versus the type where you push down to release water), so if you're used to the othe type, you may be in the habit of pulling it to the edge of the table by the spout. With that type, no problem; but if you do that here, you'll get water all over the place.Theoretically, it's a nice design, and it does take less effort than the other type of dispenser, but since the handles are high and on the sides, the spout is the natural place for people to grab, so unless you put a little sign on the spout, you may find yourself cleaning up a lot of water.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHOCN2DFGAIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00363X0X2#wasThisHelpful","R1GHOCN2DFGAIR","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you like a spongy waffle with a soft crust, you'll be happy with this ""complete"" mix. For my part, after a lot of experimenting with additions, I'm satisfied with this mix because of the convenient size for a large batch, but I do add whey for half the water (milk would work, too; I just usually have extra whey from cheesemaking), cornstarch, butter, oil & vanilla. I'm just lazy enough (and I've never found a homemade recipe that I just loved) that the convenience and being able to successfully doctor it without adding eggs (as most mixes need), make it wothwhile.Also, because you can get away without added eggs, the batter doesn't separate for at least a week, so you can portion out a werk of waffles in your fridge.

"Compared to the full range of aprons out there, these are about a 3, average size, on the thin side, decent manufacturing.

"If your main objective is to get more protein into a picky toddler (or adult), and you stick with just saucing freshly cooked pasta, you'll probable be happy with this pasta. It does not take abuse very well, so it won't hold up as well as traditional pasta in dishes that need a fair abount of stirring or baking (mac& cheese, baked ziti). The texture is a bit more like the older versions of gluten free pasta, a bit more crumbly and with a less elastic bite. I suspect that, like whole wheat pasta, over time I may object to it less, or even come to like it, as I now really like whole wheat pasta and brown rice (as long as they're used appropriately).But since the whole reason I bought this was to see my toddler through this pasta-centric phase she's in, and she doesn't seem to notice a difference (we do eat whole wheat pasta around here about 30% of the time), I'm happy. But it won't be replacing traditional pasta in our pantry for general cooking.At a playdate lunch yesterday, 3 toddlers gobbled it up--including one picky eater who ate hers plain. The rest of us had it in homemade mac & cheese. The adults weren't wild about the texture & thought the flavor a bit beany, but declared it passable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTHQ01Q76V2DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBKA2UO#wasThisHelpful","RTHQ01Q76V2DQ","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part memoir, part love letter to the traditional farming of the Lake District, and part practical guide to raising sheep, this book gives a gritty but beautiful view of a way of life that is invisible to most. It has a stream-of-consciousness feel to it, drifting around in time and place, with anecdotes about personal life and family, technical aspects of shepherding, breeding, showing sheep, and what life looks like surviving or struggling to survive in a very specialized world on a very particular piece of geography.Though some of the shepherding is peculiar to the Lake District, anyone, anywhere, with an interest in sheep or wool (or, more generally, where their fiber or food come from) should really enjoy this book. If you're a shepherd yourself, from a tiny hobby fiber flock keeper like myself (who doesn't feel up to the hefty title of ""shepherd"") to a real shepherd with a large commercial flock, you'll especially relate to the weight of responsibilities, the heartache, the joy and failures, the muck and beauty of The Shepherd's Life.I loved the cultural/geographical viewpoint and family perspective, but I also heartily appreciated it from a practical point of view. As a backyard sheep farmer (a handful of sheep on 10 acres), you can read a lot of guidebooks to raising sheep, but there's a no-nonsense gutunderstanding that those books just don't provide. I think if I'd read this book back before I'd started, I would have had a better understanding of 2 things that are really hard to get from a sheepman's manual; 1) just what a serious threat garden-variety friendly neighborhood dogs can be; and 2) that complacency with your flock and system, dropping your vigilance when everything's been going swimmingly for ages, is an equal peril. I've yet to read any book or get any spoken advice that captures those concepts as vividly and eloquently.Good stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NR2OEIWU56S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250060249#wasThisHelpful","R6NR2OEIWU56S","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really clever idea, but it does have a few problems. First off, I don't think the one-hour cure time allotted in the direction is ample to fully set the adhesive before hanging the boards. And if the adhesive isn't set, the board will fall of the wall within a few hours; once it's been removed, you won't be able to get it to set properly again. I had no problems with the command strips that I let cure overnight - 24 hours, but the one I tried after about 1 1/2 hours fell off the wall a few hours later. It's fairly humid here, but it's fairly humid a lot of places, and the instructions really should cover all normal contingencies.To the instructions to clean with alcohol, I would add: if you're trying anywhere near a kitchen (where you may have residual grease you can't even see/feel), I would highly recommend cleaning the area with all purpose cleaner, followed by a Magic Eraser, a clean rag wipe, then the recommended alcohol. I've had trouble with command strips near my kitchen in the past, and this did the trick.Finally, the built-in levels, which are a very clever idea, aren't well executed. Of the 3-pack of boards I received, one of my levels was cracked and empty, one had a bubble so big that it was useless (extended all the way to both sides--so maybe it had a slow leak as well) and one was perfect and handy. On the other hand, because you have a LOT of leeway in positioning (the gripping surface area on the back of the mount is about 10x as large as the command strip, so you have a lot of wiggle room in positioning), the level isn't altogether critical--since this isn't a one-shot application.I also know from experience that newly-mounted (24-48 hours) Command strip products do not work well in direct sunlight. I think when they've had longer to cure, they fare better; but otherwise, a few hours of sunlight will heat up the adhesive and they'll fall right off the wall.Each tile consist of 3 pieces (plus an optional riser than lets you overlap tiles or get more of a 3-D effect): 1) The Command strip, which has removable adhesive on  one side and a velcro type surface on the other. This adheres to your wall. 2) The black plastic mount with built-in level. It has a large patch (almost 5 x 5"") patch of velcro on the wall side, and a built-in level and magnetic mount on the opposite side. This piece attaches to the command strip and holds the wall tile in place. The level (theoretically)  helps you get it set just right . 3) The lightweight tile itself, which comes in dry erase, chalkboard, art/pattern & picture frame styles. It attaches magnetically into just the right spot on the mount. The mount holds it about 1"" from the wall, giving it a nice museum/canvas mount type appearance. If you use the optional riser, it is a 5x5 plastic square that attaches to the center back of the plastic mount and pushes the mount out from the wall another inch. You can easily remove and switch the face tiles around; I'd be a little more hesitant to be moving the plastic mounts on and off the wall too much, for fear of putting a strain on the adhesive strip. But you can take it off and fine-tune it a bit. If you want to use them in a new location, you can buy additional strips for under $5 package her on amazon or at Target, craft stores, etc.I'm using these for changeable signing in my business, and they do a great job. I love that you can remove them to write out your sign (for a much neater sign) and then replace them easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317N4U6W9DUPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9Q7XCS#wasThisHelpful","R317N4U6W9DUPM","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My criteria for dog foods are 1) good ingredients; 2) reasonable price, in the neighborhood of $1.50/lb, or about $45-50 for a 30lb bag; 3) dog likes it; and 4) doesn't cause farts.

Big box pet stores sell the large bag for under $60 with no sales and free shipping, but still a bit rich for me, as our dog goes through about 8-10 lbs of premium food a week, or more of the cheaper (which I typically avoid because of the giant poops).All things being equal, however, I'd get him this, as he really seems to dig it, and he's generally a pretty indifferent eater.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI5VHXOQ55TCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T62YHD4#wasThisHelpful","RI5VHXOQ55TCF","A2RQOO8VYAEZZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQOO8VYAEZZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was remarkably easy to get a small pile of tinder, it took me about 10 minutes but after I got the hang of it it went really quick. I then carefully placed the little pile on a log and used the fire starter. It took me 5 tries to light the tinder but I am brand new at this!  Once the little pile caught fire I carefully added to it and voila it grew!  I love this handy little tool! It really made starting the fire both easy and fun.

"Learning about Rosemary and her life was both heartbreaking and enlightening. The author's research to tell this story is way above and beyond and we learn some things that I'm sure the Kennedy family wishes we didn't know. The story made me so angry towards Joe and Rose, Rosemary's parents, for the way they treated her. Yes, Rosemary was well cared for because the family had money, but she certainly was not well loved by her parents... in fact quite the opposite. They basically wanted to hide her away and forget she existed, as if she were nothing more than a bother to them. It was truly disgraceful.A couple parts of the story were pretty hard to read because of the horror of knowing they'd happened, the first one being the story of Rosemary's birth which left me stunned and horrified and the second was the description of the lobotomy. Both parts were disturbing to say the least and left me feeling very emotional. However, that being said, I am so glad that I read this book and learned Rosemary's story as it certainly deserves to be told and heard. I have the utmost respect for the author for her research and dedication as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38Y67XYMUSDQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547250258#wasThisHelpful","R38Y67XYMUSDQS","A3FBM0RMCMAABV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FBM0RMCMAABV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I won't go too much into the plot as others have covered that numerous times. I'll just say that this is a sweeter than honey romance between main characters Suzanne and Mitch. At times the romance was so sweet and predictable that I just had a hard time keeping interested. Also there are times when I wondered when Suzanne would ever stand up for herself or keep being a door mat for the people who used her to babysit. I like Mitch's character a bit better than Suzanne.

I won't go too much into the plot as the other reviewers have covered it numerous times. I'll just say that I did very much enjoy the side of a female's (Rachel's) journey in her rumspringa. Usually, in most of these type of stories that time is usually written of from the man's point of view; I enjoyed reading of a different side this time. The plot moves at a quick pace which keeps you glued to your seat until you have reached the last page. There are many twists and turns that complicate the situations that occur.

"I've used these for several years, they used to be a godsend. The last 2 times I have purchased these they have been dry, crumble and if you can get them to go around the pill at all you have to use 2 or 3 of them. They have changed and cheapened something in these. I used to use these with great success and one would cover the pill completely. When I first noticed they had cheapened the product was about 2 years ago when I purchased these from my vet's office (and they were not cheap!). I gave Greenie's the benefit of the doubt as I figured perhaps the vet had sold me old/expired stock, so I ordered more here. The 2 packages I got here were both the same as the one's I got at the vet's, they crumble and are not pliable enough to even go around a small dewormer pill.

"Puzzles are a classic for children, and even the very young can enjoy them when made appropriately.  This Baby Genius Wooden Sound Puzzle reminds me of some Melissa & Doug Wooden Sound Puzzles we own, but it seems to be lighter weight, which is nice for everyone.  While the characters tell their own name and instrument as well as give a short sound sample of said instrument, when a caregiver plays with the toddler they can extend learning by talking about the generic names of the animals and colors, while children have to match up the puzzle pieces to their pictures and shapes on the boards.  While large puzzle pieces are easy for small hands to manipulate, the pegs on these pieces promote use of the pincer grip which is a key skill for young children to learn.Each character has his or her own voice and attitude, which I assume were established in Baby Genius' series of DVDs and CDs.  We have a few Baby Genius soft books and this one puzzle, but my kids have not seen any of their programs or music. You can remove each character separately or at once, and they each say their spiel and play their instrument as the piece covers the light sensor.  Unfortunately for us, these sensors are missing for DJ alligator and singing dog Lola.  All seven pieces are differently shaped and sized, if even just a tad. The music may be a bit loud for sensitive ears, but no more than most children's toys, but at least it has an off switch so you don't have sounds going off in the middle of the night if pieces go missing (it's happened).  Warning though - have two AAA batteries and a small Philips screwdriver on hand as batteries are not included.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B706XPSCD9OC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPW0376#wasThisHelpful","R1B706XPSCD9OC","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our family has used Hyland's products for several years, and we have always been pleased with the results. Hyland's is a trusted brand in our family, and this was our first time to try the Cold and Mucus Congestion syrup (though we have used similar Allergy and Cough & Cold syrups in the past.)  Just last night my seven-year-old woke me up, again, with a persistent cough.  Unlike previous nights, she finally took Highland's Cold and Mucus, if reluctantly.  She claims she doesn't like the taste, though both my three-year-old and I think it's just fine.  It took less than fifteen minutes for my daughter to fall fast asleep again and stay that way through the night.I feel good knowing that she's taking natural ingredients without any dyes or other harmful substances, which makes it an easier choice to give her some as a preventative before school. Some people may be wary of medicines without childproof caps, but I prefer them when I'm half asleep  The one bad thing about clear medicine is making sure you don't dispense too much, but that's easily remedied.

"I don't know about having ""It All,"" but this Kiddopotamus ""Hall It All"" fabric ball can be fun for all babies.  There are six sections to provide various forms of sensory opportunities with different colors, textures, and even sides.  On one of the multi-color zig-zag sections you have a child-safe mirror with the warning ""Objects seen in mirror are even cuter than they appear,"" while the other has a yellow bumpy circle to squeeze for squeaking.Two other sections have more bumps in different colors, while the other two have ridges, one horizontal, the other vertical.  Two leaves at the top crinkle while the other two do not, and there's a peek-a-boo monkey that can be pulled up, but is meant to be pushed up by squeezing the ball.  That is more a job for a parent than a baby, though, as it takes some effort and hurts my fingers after doing it just a few times, and the box does state that ""Mom squeezes. Monkey pops. Baby squeals. Repeat,"" so I guess that was their intention.  Also, the ball that makes the monkey squeeze could cause a child to fall over or possibly cry if hit in the head, so keep it gentle while playing.  There are also some short ribbons for children to grasp and tug.

"I typically enjoy reading first-time novelists at the start of a series because, well, it can only go up from here. I was drawn to this new Timber Creek K-9 series because of the dog, honestly. I really enjoyed James Rollins' Tucker Wayne K-9 series and this seemed similar. All in all, it was a decent read though it's ultimately a formulaic police procedural that could have benefited from stronger characterization, more realistic dialogue, and less by-the-numbers police/K9 procedure exposition.Mattie Cobb is a strong and likeable female detective character, and I doubt that she will be more fleshed out and subsequent novels. Her dog, Robo, is sort of a super police dog, best of the best, perfect specimen type animal. I appreciated the way Rollins' put the reader inside the mind of Tucker Wayne's dog, and I was missing that here. While a strong central character, Robo is just there, being all strong and perfect all the time. I wanted to care more. The plot itself involves drugs, the death of a teenager, and some quirky small town folks. The Killing Trail creates a sort of less interesting, less ironic Twin Peaks environment, but that said I am interested in returning to Timber Creek and learning more.My primary criticisms: The dialogue is a bit wobbly and less authentic than j had hoped, and there is just way to much flat out procedural explanation about police work and K-9 work. Some of it was interesting, but I tired of it quickly.  Hopefully future installments will limit that type of the necessary exposition. The plot, though twisty, was a bit predictable for me and there's only one true action sequence in the novel. Apart from a few brief scares, it's mostly a series of interviews and investigation. Nothing wrong with a procedural, but all in all I do think the series can only get better. A decent start, worth considering as a quick summer read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C0ZJOI935485/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629533815#wasThisHelpful","R2C0ZJOI935485","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Way back, around the time of Return of the Jedi, I collected a lot of Star Wars micro figure sets - the Death Star, Hoth, Bespin. This Force Awakens set brought me right back to that childhood, except the level of detail here is staggering.My seven-year-old daughter is just beginning to explore the world of Star Wars. She has seen the original films and she dressed as princess Leia for Halloween this year. This is a great way to get her excited for the new movie. This is basically a big Star Destroyer that opens up, Transformers-like, into a miniature ""battlefield"" with lots of opportunities for fun and engagement. My daughter loves this, and she has the smal fingers and the patience to really have fun with this. As an adult, I preferred the simpler pleasures of the old micro figures and their basic sets. Once opened, this looks too complicated (and too fragile) for me. But she loves it and so far nothing has broken or chipped. The main downside, instantly articulated by my daughter, is the lack of figures. In addition to the ships, you get Kylo Ren and Finn mini figures (exceptionally well detailed for truly tiny people). Of course, other figures and ships are available separately.All in all, I can see this being a great set for any little Star Wars fan. Collectors may find list to like here simply because the fun is in the execution of the toy rather than simply looking at it on a shelf. For playtime, this is recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33AEDD6TXMBYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOFZSZK#wasThisHelpful","R33AEDD6TXMBYR","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have used an alarm monitoring system for many years at our home, but this Lorex wireless video surveillance system is really the big next step. Ultimately, I was surprised and very impressed by how easy this was to set up. I had always avoided anything beyond the standard alarm because I figured it would take too long and cost too much to get a full system in place. But this was a simple two-camera/monitor wireless set up that I was able to install without much difficulty right out of the box.One camera in the front of our house, one in the back - very easy. These are indoor/outdoor cameras, and while noticeable, were discreet yet visible enough to please me.  You also get a 7 inch monitor, and there is a free app you can download for your iPhone or Android to monitor the camera feed. The app is great for simple reasons. For example, now I can check at anytime of the day whether or not I have a package on the porch. I often worry, particularly around the holidays, about large packages sitting on my porch all day while I am out.The video quality is high definition, with audio, and exceeded my expectations. I figured at the price point, for an all in one simple system, it might be grainy or poor quality, but not at all. If you are looking for a simple, easy to install, surveillance system to protect your home or small office, this Lorex system is a great setup to consider. I really do feel safer, especially when I'm out and can monitor my home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WPPX3M68GAWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SK0ULM#wasThisHelpful","R1WPPX3M68GAWC","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the past several years, I have tried out a wide variety of Jarrow Formulas supplements, and I tend to like them all even if they do not immediately show their benefits in a concrete way. Jarrow delivers quality, and it has become a trusted brand in our family. I deal with a lot of stress, between work and two kids, and I was interested to see if PS-PA Synergy capsules helped me at all. These pills are supposed to support a healthy stress response, specifically benefiting ""cognition, mental performance, attentiveness and reaction time."" At the outset I should say that I do take a very low dose (essentially a ""children's dose,"" according to my doctor) of anti-depressant each day for anxiety, and I knew going in that there could possibly be some reaction. I gradually, over the course of a month, worked PS-PA into my daily supplement regimen, and I have to say that the effects were almost instantaneous.  Whether these pills enhanced the functionality of my anti-depressant or worked solely on their own, I suddenly found myself incredibly relaxed during my day. For the month I regularly took this supplement, I did not really experience much stress or at least did not let typical stress impact my daily routine.The downside is that these may have worked a little too well. Rather than enhancing my cognitive abilities, I found myself easily distracted, relaxed, and prone to a bit of uncharacteristic forgetfulness. It was all minor stuff, like leaving milk on the counter instead of putting it back in the fridge or leaving the house without my cell phone. At work, I forgot to do one minor assignment for a day or so. Again, I cannot say that this was due to the PS-PA alone, but this type of distraction is very, very unlike me as I am typically an extremely focused, easily stressed individual. On the plus side, things did not really bother me. My anxiety was better, and I was more relaxed dealing with my children. One other thing I noticed over the past month is that my appetite increased and my anxiety about over-eating went away. The result?  Of course, I did not watch my diet and I gained more weight than I would care to admit. Ultimately, after a month, I felt I had to stop taking PS-PA because, wow, it sort of worked a little too well in terms of eliminating or lessening my reaction to stress. The cons, for me, outweighed the pros, though I suspect it was more a reaction with other medications than anything else. Thus, I can say that I honestly believe this supplement from Jarrow does what it advertises, although your reaction may vary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5IIPP9CX3LQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFOR9AK#wasThisHelpful","R5IIPP9CX3LQG","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My youngest daughter, age three, got the (white) Super Snackin' Sara doll a month or so ago and while it took her a while to warm up to it, because she was a little afraid of the moving mouth, she does play it regularly. She saw that I had the opportunity to try out the African American variation of Snackin' Sara and to my surprise and delight, she asked for a ""sister"" for her doll. I was happy to comply, curious to see how she would respond to a new doll and whether this one would initially scare her out of the box. And this one did not. These two Baby Alive dolls now live side-by-side, and my daughter seems happier to have a set of ""twins"" rather than just the one doll she had initially.I wrote a review for the first Snackin' Sara, and I want to share some of that relevant information here as well: My eldest daughter, now age seven, had a Baby Alive doll years ago that she loved very much. I had the chance to try this Super Snacks doll for my youngest, age three, and I hoped she would have a similar reaction. This is a fancier doll than the Baby Alive we had in the past, with a moving mouth, lots of sounds and phrases, food, and a couple of diapers. Obviously the diapers provided are a starter pack as you are supposed to buy more because the more this doll ""eats,"" the more she will release into her diaper, much like a real child.As I mentioned, my three-year-old was a bit scared of it at first, because the doll makes what one might consider almost sinister chomping sounds and there is a real oddness of the rubbery mouth movements. But you get used to it, and my daughter really seems to like this doll now. She took to this African American Sara right out of the box and seems to prefer her to the white doll she got a month ago. She likes to brush this doll's hair quite a lot actually.As with the other doll, my daughter is more into pretend playing with food because, even at age three, she does not like sticky messes, and when we mixed some food and went through the diaper-changing process with the first doll, she constantly asked to wash her hands. We have not mixed food for this Sara, and she seems perfectly fine with that, pretending to feed her while the doll makes that - to a parent, kind of creepy - move movements and sounds. All in all, I still rank this four out of five stars because it is a bit creepy to me though my daughter seems to really enjoy her ""sisters.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PHRCFCGD6NEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG4VQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3PHRCFCGD6NEO","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My two kids are eagerly awaiting the new Star Wars movie, having recently watched the other six movies and becoming increasingly interested in the characters. As a kid who played with Star Wars toys non-stop in the early '80s, I am always interested in new toys that my enchant and interest my kiddos. This Hot Wheels ""Escape from Jakku"" playset looked like a lot of fun with flying ships and lots of detail. And indeed, the photos do not do the set justice in terms of the detail. From the crashed Star Destroyer to the intricately detailed Millennium Falcon, this set screams ""collector,"" and were it not for my kids, I suspect I might set this up and then relegate it to a high shelf for display purposes. And in fact, that may be the best option for this because as a toy, it does not deliver the thrills and long play that one might hope for.It's a very basic game, where you try to knock down the plastic Tie Fighters with your die-cast Falcon while relevant sound effects play. And that's about it. So long as you know what you're getting, this can be an enjoyable game for two kids to play for a while together, taking turns operating the Falcon. But for adults and even for kiddos, the excitement of this does not last long. The looping Falcon is awesome, the first time or three, but after that it just becomes a very basic knock-em-down game that can be achieved to a degree with three cans and a rubber ball. Playing with my kids, we tried to make stories out of it, talking about Han and Chewie inside the Falcon, trying to get some sort of plans from on board one of the Tie Fighters. But after about ten minutes or so, my kids got a bit bored and moved on to other toys. I am not sure how often they will return to this set, although their enthusiasm for Star Wars in general is still high so I conclude it's this specific toy and not the franchise that they got bored with. For collectors, thumbs up for an awesome showpiece and occasional gimmicky toy. For kids, their attention span may vary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV0XMD6LHEMSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3VXZQ2#wasThisHelpful","RV0XMD6LHEMSB","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I took prenatal DHA during both of my pregnancies, and my doctor told me that it's fine to continue taking DHA beyond if I so choose. As a result, I have tried several varieties over the years, though this was my first time to try the Viva Labs brand. I was very impressed. These are very manageable pills to take. Hooray, finally, a prenatal vitamin that is meant for a woman and not a filly. These gel capsules go down easily without any nasty tastes or strong smells, and there's a nice quantity to boot. So often you get DHA vitamins that are either excessively large or taste awful or smell fishy, but remarkably Viva Labs has developed a formula that avoids all of these typical DHA pitfalls and delivers a quality product. I now wish I had had these to take during my pregnancies, but I still enjoy them today as a regular daily vitamin. Easily and highly recommended for pregnant women out there who want the best, most manageable pills available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GTSMHIT4NCTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JTF2LO#wasThisHelpful","R3GTSMHIT4NCTI","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Evalar Seeds of Beauty drink mix, beauty comes at a price. I'm no stranger to powdered drink additives as I've done everything from Crystal Light to teas to fiber mixes. First, let me say that I'd rather drink tasteless fiber than this concoction. The first time I tried Seeds of Beauty I put it in my tumbler that already had ice and water, then stirred as best I could with the hard straw. Not all the pieces got broken up (could still taste it next time I refilled my tumbler), so the next time I poured it into a water bottle and shook it like crazy. It dissolved nicely, no grainy texture or taste, but that didn't improve the overall flavor. It is supposed to be a ""natural pineapple"" flavoring, but it tastes more like an artificial pina colada mix, but I forced myself to drink it all. I simply cannot recommend this based on the taste, which is too bad as I was hoping to like it.  Fortunately young skin runs in my family, so I'll take my chances on genes rather than subject myself to that taste again.As for the packaging, the box contains square pouches that are easy to open, but you have to be careful when pouring if you have a narrow spout - I love my tea packets that fit into the opening of water bottles - no fuss no muss. If you don't mind the taste of fake flavors and are willing to do anything to keep wrinkles at bay, then enjoy. Otherwise, wait for another flavor or brand.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZCOTBJ59RZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KZGVB2#wasThisHelpful","R26ZCOTBJ59RZU","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I eat protein bars every day, and over the years I have tried a wide variety of brands and flavors. But I always end up coming back to Pure Protein, which is simply the best in my opinion, offering not only a fantastic 20 to 21 grams of protein per bar, but tasting the best as well.  I had tried the Chocolate Deluxe flavor before, but this Variety Pack allowed me to also sample the Chocolate Peanut Butter and Chewy Chocolate Chip. There are a total of eighteen bars in this package, providing six of each flavor.  It's a great way to sample the Pure Protein brand for newbies and also a great value buy for people like me who already eat protein bars each day but like to mix it up with different flavors.Pure Protein bars are short and thick little bars, not as long as most other protein bars out there, but they usually pack in about twice the amount of protein. I have found few bars that offer such a substantial amount of protein while keeping the sugar low (2-3 grams per bar) and the saturated fat at no more than 3 grams. Each bar also provides a variety of vitamins, 8% of your daily iron, and 1-2 grams of dietary fiber. I eat one for breakfast with water or occasionally skim milk, and it lasts me through lunchtime with no real hunger issues. These would also be a great afternoon snack, kept in a desk drawer, to fight off hunger and pump up your energy between lunch and dinner. The only real downside to Pure Protein bars, as I mentioned, is that they are shorter (yet thicker) than most other bars. That means that after a couple decent bites, they are gone. If I were to redesign the brand's bars, I might make them longer and thinner, simply to make them last longer. But considering that the protein and nutrients they provide, without unnecessary fat and suger, this is a winner all the way around. Recommended as the best protein bars out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BOBJU5SW1HOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01126O3OY#wasThisHelpful","R2BOBJU5SW1HOZ","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good cat tree, which our fourteen-year-old, slow-moving tabby enjoys quite a lot.  From the photo, I worried that he would have a difficult time climbing up and especially fitting in the little house since he is overweight. But ultimately he had no difficulty and went up there immediately. Our cat enjoys his privacy, and I suspect he'll be spending a lot of time in his little treehouse.My young daughters helped me put it together. It was not terribly difficult, arriving in one box with seven pieces. There are clear instructions enclosed and screws and washers to hold everything together. More than anything, we were all impressed with the softness of the exterior. It is by far the softest pet structure we have had, having had two previous huts/playgrounds covered in a rough carpet material. This is soft like a plush toy, though on the downside I do suspect it'll wear faster and get covered in fur.  For now, however, our cat really likes this tree. And it really does resemble a ""tree"" with its bark-like trunk rising up to the house, a detail perhaps lost on our cat but appreciated by the rest of us who want his area of the house to look as nice as possible.

"Our family has tried a number of VTech toys over the years for our two kids (ages seven and three), and we have found them to all be worthwhile fun and educational toys. This Smart Animals Grow and Learn Farm is no exception. There's a lot to do here for a curious child, and my three-year-old has spent a lot of time playing with it as intended and in her own imaginative way. First, as with everything from VTech, there's educational activities built into the toys. My daughter can learn about numbers and colors by pressing various buttons on the farmhouse. The interactive rooster figure can activate several touchpoints to make sounds or play music. Naturally, there are several other animals sold separately if you want full interactivity with this farm set. That, to me, is the biggest shortcoming. This is a big fun farm set that comes with a single rooster as the only animal friend, though the box clearly depicts (all sold separately) a lamb, a cow, and a horse. So far my daughter has not asked for the other critters, but I suspect it's just a matter of time once she gets as much as she can out of her lonely rooster friend.Even with a single figure, you can do lots of things with this set. There's a clever activity where you can ""grow"" carrots, and the pieces are giant Lego-like blocks that can seemingly fit together in different configurations for at least a little bit of variety. All in all, this is one of the better farm playsets that my daughter enjoys. (She has several, and I would say she has played with this longer than most of them.)  For curious little ones, this is a nifty little set worth considering. Just be aware that you only get one animal, and additional purchases will likely be desired by any child who studies the box carefully enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROMHJGDS7BHGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUZH3QQ#wasThisHelpful","ROMHJGDS7BHGZ","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our family has been using Hyland's homeopathic remedies for years now, and we trust and appreciate this brand. In addition to their allergy and cough and cold syrups, we have found that our two daughters (three and seven) respond well to their little tablets for rest and relaxation.  Those calming tablets - which look exactly the same as these Chamomile tablets - contain Chamomile x6 as well as several other ingredients.  I was glad to try out these Chamomile 30x tablets (with no other ingredients) to see how well they worked by comparison. These are actually quite a bit better and seem to work faster.These are labeled for teething and irritability, but we had success with these on two kids who are no longer teething. Like most kids, our daughters bicker on the weekend and get overly hyper and whiny at times. My eldest, age seven, has mild ADHD and takes daily medication to help her focus and stay calm. These homeopathic tablets help smooth out some of the rougher patches when little things bother her like a missing toy or her little sister knocking something over. Both kids, in fact, respond well to this and they really, really love the taste apparently.  Neither gives me any trouble taking two tiny tablets at a time. These can really be used for all sorts of real or imagined ailments. My daughter requests her ""little pills"" when she claims to have a mild stomachache or a leg cramp, etc. And a few minutes after taking these apparently magic pills, things are all better and she's playing as usual. But realistically, I have noticed a difference in their attitudes after taking just one dose. The little things don't bother them, and they are not as quick to fight with one another.I would recommend this as an additional supplement for ADHD kids already taking medication. For teething and other minor troubles, these would also likely be helpful. Hyland's is a good brand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25S4NYET5LB7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EPQ482#wasThisHelpful","R25S4NYET5LB7W","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not used an HP printer in a while, but I have had mostly good experiences in past with the brand.  This particular printer is medium size all-in-one printer with fax, print, scan, and copy functions.  Scanning is easy and it makes good copies of documents.  The printer is compatible with mobile device printing through AirPrint, Android, and Google Cloud printing.This printer is clearly meant for home or small office use and is best for document printing and copying.  It can be used for photo printing, but you will not get results as good as with an actual photo printer or higher resolution scanner.  That said, I have printer some documents with pictures or charts included and found the colors to be good for what I needed.As with most all in one devices, it was very quick and easy to get the printer setup on my home wireless network.  I have used the printing, copying, and wireless scanning functions.  Based on the prompts at setup and the included quick start guide, the fax function should be easy to setup for those who need that capability. Overall, this a good printer at this price point.  The automatic document feeder holds about 30-35 pages, so it clearly not going to work on larger print jobs.  However, for home use this should be pretty good.

"I am always on the lookout for good dishcloths for the kitchen, and I liked the ""lemon yellow"" color of these New Designs Homespun Dishcloths.  I was a little hesitant since they looked much less sturdy than what I am used to using, and in this case, my concerns were right on the money.  One look at these dish cloths out of the box, and you just know they aren't going to get the job done.  They look rough, which seems to be a helpful quality in a dish cloth, but it's worth noting that they are not hard on the hands.Unfortunately, the material just doesn't get the job done.  I poured a small amount of water on my electric stove and tried to wipe it dry, to no avail, and found streaking in addition. A single paper towel did a better job in the end.  I poured a bit more water into a ceramic dish, and I attempted to dry with the cloth. Once again, it remained wet.  In the end, I suspect we'll use these primarily to dry hands, as they don't really work on dishes (which is odd and unfortunate for a ""dishcloth."")  I do like the home style design.  It really does have a homemade quality as opposed to something factory produced, but these were just not that great in function.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10OSC4DZP1UAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0XO0ZC#wasThisHelpful","R10OSC4DZP1UAM","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""The Scribe,"" Matthew Guinn provides a lyrical, haunting study of evil, madness, and racism in a vividly-detailed Atlanta in the fragile decades following the Civil War.  His writing is poetic and descriptive with good characterization throughout as we meet a colorful cast of fictional and historical figures. The plot, in short, involves a disgraced from Atlanta detective who is summoned back to the city to assist in a brutal series of murders. Everything you would expect from a typical mystery/thriller is here - graphic violence, clues, witnesses, and a shadowy organization of officials running the show behind the scenes.While not a perfect novel, it was a swift and engaging read that I completed in a couple of sittings.  That said, the characters', and author's, tendency to dwell at great length on the evil that men do and the nature of evil does get a bit annoying after a while. The specter of the Civil War hangs over the entire story, providing a historical backdrop and context for the crimes being committed.  The Holmes and Watson-like detective duo at the heart of ""The Scribe"" is a fascinating pair, and I was glad to see a sequel set up in the final pages.  This could be an interesting series of stories across the South in the late 19th Century.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QTZILW4X7RHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393239292#wasThisHelpful","R2QTZILW4X7RHD","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every so often a toy like this Wonder Workshop Dot robot comes along that makes me wish I was a kid again. Robotic-type toys were incredibly primitive in the 1980s, and never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that my eldest daughter would be able to operate a tiny robot via an app on her smartphone. As soon as Dot arrived, we downloaded the Wonder app for iPhone.  It guides you through slowly and easily, explaining what Dot can do and how - ""behaviors"" such as lights, sounds, moves, and animations, and how to link them - through visually-based coding.  I tried a little bit of this on my own before handing it over to my daughter.  And honestly, it's a lot of fun (though I suspect the Dash bot is even better than the Dot we tested out).  The app is divided into sections like Scroll Quest which are guided activities, Free Play where you can do your own thing, and the Inventor's Log which keeps track of what you've done and what Dot has ""learned.""  The challenges -- and there are apparently some 300 on the app -- provide explorations through various locations like space, Africa, and the Arctic.  While we have not yet gotten very far, clearly you can do a lot with Dot using this app.My daughter is currently seven and a half, so she is just under the minimum required age for this toy/learning device.  I was worried that it might be too much for her, but honestly I think any kid who is interested in learning and curious can follow the necessary steps.  My daughter has mild ADHD, and this is a fantastic tool for getting her to focus with intensity on a task with Dot's actions providing an incentive at the end of the coding challenge.  On a Saturday morning, for example, it's a great way to get her brain going before we start to work on her homework for Monday.  My youngest is curious about Dot and said it was ""cute,"" like a blue Mike from Monsters, Inc.  I'm thrilled with this little device, and I would much rather my daughter learn fun coding than play mindless games on her phone.

"This is a terrific all-in-one outdoor game set that our whole family genuinely enjoys. There's a lot to like about this. First, it's self-contained. Even though there are lots of loose pieces, which is every parent's nightmare, everything fits into place and the entire unit seals shut so there's no mess. Though too big for either of my daughters to carry, it's got a handle for portability.

There's even a little scoring system for serious play, and of course, the washers and bean bags are separated into team colors.

"For this review, I was able to try a single 3.52 ounce bar of Cailler L'Ecorce dark chocolate, 70% cocoa. I love dark chocolate and I try as many kinds as I can, though this Swiss company (since 1819) was unfamiliar to me.Their chocolate is fantastically dark and intensely flavorful. It reminded me a little of Ghirardelli 60% which has long been our family's go-to dark chocolate. This, however, is a little stronger, less sweet, and very smooth. It's great chocolate, period.Nutritionally, this is a fattening bar despite its deliciousness. There are 2.5 servings in a bar, each of which has 240 calories, 18 grams of fat (11 of which are saturated), and 11 grams of sugar.

"My family and I have been using reusable grocery bags for several years now.  We have amassed a collection of all shapes and sizes, from expensive insulated zipper bags to one-dollar Trader Joe's bags, and we just grab a few from the trunk whenever we go grocery shopping. This SnapBasket from CleverMade is one of the larger bags we now use, and it is by far the most convenient to store. Most of our bags just get stuffed into the largest of the lot for quick trunk storage, but this SnapBasket nicely folds down flat for storage anywhere. To use you just snap it upright by pressing plastic hinges on either side -- simple yet effective.It provides quite a bit of storage space when opened up, just over 31 quarts according to the packaging. Realistically translated, it'll hold six to eight cereal boxes or cracker boxes of regular size, or two vertical stacks of frozen dinners or any similar combination. For a family of four, we could probably get our week's worth of shopping into three of these, which is better than, say, six or eight of the smaller, cheaper bags.In addition, there's an inside pocket with a zipper that could hold something small and flat-ish like sliced cheese, greeting cards, or similar. The two handles are sturdy and work well, though I do wish there could have been a shoulder strap as well like my (granted, more expensive) insulated zipper bag.If you and your family regularly carry around reusable shopping bags, this is a good, clever bag - large, portable, and sturdy - that's well worth considering.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IVWXUX5RT1GC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PIZT4I#wasThisHelpful","R3IVWXUX5RT1GC","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Blue Energy X smartphone runs the Android Lollipop v5.1 operating system out of the box.  For existing Android users, this phone offers your typical smartphone options and functions.  The 5 inch screen is on par with various other models available with the Android OS and falls roughly half way between the two sizes available from Apple.  While the display can certainly be considered HD, I was able to compare the home screens side-by-side with my sisters iPhone 6 and noted that the picture resolution is not quite as crisp.I have used the phone for a few days now and find that the battery holds a charge well throughout the day.  Typically, I charge my phone overnight and need it to last all of the next day for phone calls, text messages, games, and some video streaming.  I encountered no problems with this phone and had a fourth of the battery or so to spare.  To preserve battery life, I keep my phone on the middle brightness level and try to routinely close apps left running in the background.In terms of the external design of the phone, a couple of points are worth mentioningalthough in general term there's nothing particularly unique about this model.  The lock and volume buttons are located on the right side of the phone, and the power/USB cord port is on the bottom.  The camera, flash bulb, and headphone jack are all located at the top of the phone.  I found the volume and lock buttons to be comfortable to use, but they are somewhat awkward if you take advantage of the included flexible plastic case.One design element I do not like is the placement of the primary speaker.  It is a thin bar located just below the middle on the back of the phone.  I find that although the volume is good when held, it is considerably muffled when set down on a table.  I suggest especially that if you plan on using the alarm clock function on this phone as I often do, you should leave the phone on the bed side table upside down to be sure you can hear it.  However, I would have to say that the phone design is pretty good.  It is comfortable to hold with smooth edges on the back, and the Gorilla Glass display gives me confidence that even with just using the included case, the phone can stand up to wear and tear from everyday use.  There is nothing about this phone that really jumps out at you to make you think it is a must have device, but if you want a good Android phone this is definitely a model to consider.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TTKE5SKROYFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XIHS62#wasThisHelpful","R1TTKE5SKROYFS","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second standalone novel I have read by Tess Gerritsen, and it is easily my favorite. Despite being shorter than I would have liked, and as a result wrapping up a little too quickly and nearly for my tastes, ""Playing with Fire"" is a rare book that sticks with you and makes you think. I finished it over a week ago, and it's been on my mind. It moved me, which is rare for a mystery/thriller.The novel is primarily modern day mystery, which is suitably creepy at times in a way that's  reminiscent of an old Twilight Zone episode. (Anything involving odd or violent behavior in children freaks me out.) I love the idea of music hiding a secret, and for music lovers, there's a lot to like here. Despite the modern story, there are a number of historical flashbacks that tell a fictional, yet heartbreaking love story from the Holocaust. It's painful at times, especially the feeling of dread as you move along in the story already aware of how it is bound to end. The juxtaposition of these two stories is stark and jarring. You sense something almost supernatural at work or at the very least, unexplained.The conclusion felt rushed, and that's my only complaint. Perhaps I was just selfishly wishing that the novel would go on longer because I was enjoying it so much. Either way, ""Playing with Fire"" is a worthwhile read. As someone who tackles 40-60 books a year, I know when I catch a keeper. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OEV6MNXIKWIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101884347#wasThisHelpful","R2OEV6MNXIKWIN","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not sure what to expect from Ocean Spray Pact, concerned that with only one gram of sugar in 16 fluid ounces I would either have an extremely tart drink or one with unnatural artificial sweetness. You see, I love cranberry juice and was told years ago by my doctor to drink it regularly, but I've tried to avoid it in recent years because of the sugar content. Diet cranberry juices, even by Ocean Spray, just taste fake to me and don't deliver the nutritional benefits I desire. Enter Pact, which amazingly meets me halfway, delivering a big concentration of health in a naturally sweetened drink with a single gram of (natural) sugar. But how did it taste?Pact is not the slightest bit tart. It's smooth and subtle, with a slight hint of cranberry dominated by the flavor of raspberry. It is refreshing, no doubt about it. It's not overly sweet, but sadly what  sweetness there is has that artificial taste to it, despite the use of two natural sweeteners. You know in an instant there's no real sugar in this, but it's not an offensive taste. My initial impression was that it was a bit like watered down Diet Snapple, though that does not do justice to it because it really is quite good. Not everyone will like it, I suspect, but it's worth noting that there's just that subtle hint of un-real sweetness. If you like carbonated flavored waters, you'll like this - minus the carbonation, of course.Pact is not cranberry juice - as the label says ""Contains no juice."" It's water, natural sweeteners, and cranberry extract. Sixteen ounces boasts ""the power of 50 cranberries,"" because it offers 80mg of proanthocyanidins. It claims to cleanse and purify the body, and of course, there's no denying the proven health benefits of cranberries. I would recommend that anyone seeking the nutritional benefits of cranberries without all of the sugar found in cranberry juice give this a serious try. Healthy, subtle, and not shockingly sweet, it's a keeper for me. The best of both worlds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QC5H2AY7KUCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSC3B4O#wasThisHelpful","R2QC5H2AY7KUCC","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With multiple family members' health to track, including two small children, I love technological medical apps, and the SmartTemp app not only helps track the progression of fevers but also symptoms (limited to their choices) and medicines given so you can share all this information with a medical professional or babysitters with the parents, whether through the app or via email, which can provide lists and/or charts.The app, which is easy to set up by simply scanning the Redline code on the back of the box, allows you to create multiple profiles and choose how the temperature was taken, so you have three places depending on the age of the child.  You can view the history of each profile and create reminders to take a temperature again at a given time, though it would better be served as an actual alarm than an alert.  There is also a table which helps you know whether a temperature taken is within a safe or dangerous range, again depending on where it was taken, and this provided in both Fahrenheit and Celsius.  Even the light on thermometer will change colors depending on the temperature range.However, the actual temp only shows up on the app, not the thermometer itself.  Not sure this matters for us as the thermometer didn't even take an accurate oral reading out of the three of us.  According to the app we should take a morning and afternoon reading while feeling well and average the two to determine base temperature, but we were all feeling just fine and two of us were determined to have temperatures over 100, so I may just have to test it out some more. But this is something for folks to be wary. Also, the protective cover for the thermometer does not stay on or I simply have to figure out how to snap it on properly. I almost sent the device flying out of my hand before I discovered this.The thermometer can be used with probe covers, but I had unfortunately ran out, so I don't know if that affects readings. At least the thermometer is not heavy and sits easy under the tongue. Also in the app are FAQs, troubleshooting, the manual, and tips on wellness, though some are just advertisements for more Vicks products, but still helpful. Overall, the app is great but the thermometer itself was disappointing, so I'll split the difference.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R377IGOPZTIYL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01410Z22U#wasThisHelpful","R377IGOPZTIYL2","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Epson Expression Photo XP-960 is designed to be a small home-use printer for photos and documents.  It has the standard features everyone now expects from all-in-one models including wireless connectivity, scanning, copying, and memory card ports.  As part of the ""small-in-one"" class, a key feature of this printer is its relatively small footprint.  I have a large hutch on my desk with multiple-shelf cabinets built in on either side.  I was comfortably able to fit the printer in the roughly 12 inch high space without having any problems accessing the scanning platform. The printer needs space approximately 18-20 inches wide on a desk as well, so it should not overwhelm most standard computer desks.This printer was clearly designed with photos in mind.  In addition to the memory card ports, the printer features access points for USB drives or an external hard drive as well as connectivity with Epson's smartphone app.  There are also features that would be great for people who do crafts or custom projects.  The printer has a rear feeding slot for card stock as well as a dedicated tray for CD and DVD printing.  Photo and picture quality is excellent as I have come to expect from Epson.  However, as with many newer models, this printer uses six separate ink cartridges.  The box highlights this as a cost saving feature as you only replace the ink you need, but some how I always seem to have to replace two or more at the same time at a higher overall cost.Overall, if you are looking for a small but powerful printer for everyday use, this is definitely a great choice.  It gives you a lot of options for various projects from printing text only documents to professional quality photos.  Due to personal preference, I usually try to make sure that any printer I get has a front loading paper tray.  I am pleased to say that despite its small size, this printer is indeed front loading for standard paper.  Obviously it does not hold as much paper as a larger office style all-in-one model, but it is ideal for everyday home use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YP4Y8I80QFML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5Y1O#wasThisHelpful","R2YP4Y8I80QFML","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have taken a statin medication daily for the past decade to help with my high cholesterol. At my doctor's insistence, I started taking 100 mg of Co Q-10 every day to replenish what Co Q-10 my station medication takes away from my body.  Over the last 10 years, I have tried a wide variety of brands, organic boutique and generic store brands. All of them have worked fine, exactly the same, so I tend to go with the cheapest and highest quantity available.These 100mg soft gels from Viva Labs are just fine. They are comparable in size to the current pills I had been taking from Puritan's Pride. They go down smoothly and have caused no issues for me. This bottle contains 150 daily pills, which is less than I usually get when I buy a bulk package. By comparison, my bottle from Puritan's Pride contains 240.

"My two daughters are big Frozen fans, though I'll say at the outset that we have not yet seen the short ""Frozen Fever."" This book is seemingly based around that short, where Elsa throws a birthday party for Anna, and if your kids like it - or just like the Frozen characters in general, they'll probably love helping plan a Frozen birthday party.Personally, our family tends to choose a theme and then buy ready-made supplies and a cake and be done with it, but this book offers a series of creative ideas for a do-it-yourself endeavor. I think we can still go that route and yet use this book to add a few homemade embellishments, such as the Arendelle Spring Nectar and Flower Coasters. More creative folks, with more time on their hands, can enjoy utilizing the templates and creating their very own invitations, decorations, (cup)cakes, and party favors.Beyond that, there are a few party games everyone can utilize, but some may require familiarity with the Disney short to understand and play properly. All in all, I'd say that I f you're into creating parties from scratch, then buy the book and have fun. For the rest, there's not a whole lot here and it would be easier to get a few (free) activities online to enhance a party.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JRL7SKQ64IYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940787254#wasThisHelpful","R2JRL7SKQ64IYL","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was my first Maggie Hope mystery, and I really enjoyed it. I often hesitate to jump into ongoing series because I fear being lost, but I was able to navigate ""Mrs. Roosevelt's Confidante"" without feeling as though I was missing some big piece of the story.  There are clearly some ongoing character issues, particularly involving Maggie's family, that I was unclear of at first, but most everything was explained by the conclusion.  I was drawn to this actually because I enjoy seeing how presidents are characterized in historical fiction, and a mystery surrounding the Roosevelt White House was an exciting prospect.  I say ""mystery"" because that is how the novel is labeled, but I felt there was just a tiny bit of mystery.  I think ""A Maggie Hope Adventure"" would have been a better subtitle because it was all about the thrill of the chase rather than guessing who the criminals were (as they were identified from the start).Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt are not central figures, though at least Eleanor appears numerous times in the novel.  Prime Minister Winston Churchill is a far more central figure, although I found that most of the real-life figures were secondary or background characters.  And that's just fine because this novel really seems to capture the spirit of the time even with the fluid and descriptive writing style.  This would be a terrific television series, I suspect.  It was engaging and enjoyable throughout as the action took place in and around Washington, D.C., for the most part in weeks following Pearl Harbor.  And despite being set in 1941, it does an excellent job of bringing to life current real-world issues like political scandal, government wiretapping, homophobia, and racism.  One can learn a lot studying the figures of this time period and applying some of these lessons to our world today.Although I was drawn to this by the promise of a fictionalized Franklin Roosevelt, I found myself wrapped up in the novel's heroine and her friends by the end, to the point that I very well might seek out the previous adventures in this series.  Easily recommended for a quick, fun, and historical intriguing read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N3GNMDN7ITZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178704#wasThisHelpful","R2N3GNMDN7ITZZ","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have given my daughters, currently 7 and 3 years, Hyland's products before, including the tablet allergy medicine in the past, so I can attest to it's continuous effectiveness. I like that Hyland's uses ingredients found in the ""Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States,"" and that there is a wide range of symptoms that Complete Allergy not only helps but also prevents.Unlike a well-known allergy medicine such as Claritin or Allegra, however, Hyland's does not promise relief in 24 or even 12 hour spurts, but one dose a day tends to do well for my children.  The good thing about that is if there is a sudden attack, I don't feel bad about giving another dosage, and have even used the tablets as a ""placebo/sugar"" pill in the past when they whine about questionable aches and ills - it usually does the trick.I may have to stick to the tablets rather than the liquid form, though, as my older daughter declared that Complete Allergy in liquid tastes ""gross.""

"I was eager to try this holistic cat food for my 14-year-old tabby. He is picky about a lot of things, but he tends to love his food. And this was by far the shiniest, prettiest packaging I have ever seen for cat food, and the cat loved the packaging too, pawing at the sparkly multicolored foil on the front.The ingredients list tells you immediately but this is a healthy, all natural food. The first few ingredients are chicken meal, potatoes, canola oil, peas, chicken, ocean fish meal, and dried eggs. Further on down the list we have carrots, pumpkin, apples, cranberries, blueberries, broccoli, and sesame oil. The food is 42% crude protein and 20% crude fat.Unfortunately, my cat did not seem to like this food. And it was very disappointing for all of us. He did try it at first and we mixed a little bit with his current food to ease the transition. But after a while he started picking out the old food nuggets and leaving this new holistic food behind. Perhaps it was ""too natural"" for him and just too unlike what he's been eating for years. That makes me think it might be better to start a younger kitty on this food rather than a fourteen-year-old. All in all, I am pleased by the nutrition I see in this food and its holistic approach to health, though reluctantly I'll rate it ""just ok"" because my cat simply did not take to it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7A7CPC8GTI1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PAV2CDM#wasThisHelpful","R7A7CPC8GTI1F","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're shopping for a school-boarder, or anyone else who uses a public shower on a regular basis, then this DII mesh caddy is a good choice for toting all those shower essentials.  There is a main basket with smaller pockets of various sizes for organization (razors, creams, toothbrushes, various sized tubes/containers, etc.), and since the mesh bag is already light-weight it won't be overly heavy.The caddy can sit on a cabinet or hang from a knob or hook, and you don't have to worry about water accumulating at the bottom since it drips right through the thick mesh.  Even though it doesn't have a solid form, which is great for packing when not in use, it remained upright even though I didn't have it filled with products.I placed 4 containers of various sizes, a poof, and razor, and still had plenty of room for other items that may be needed.

"I was pleased to try out this Playskool Dressy Kids doll for my three-year-old daughter who is eager to do everything on her own.  She is moderately good at managing her own Velcro sneakers, and this doll offers the opportunity to practice that skill, along with a button, a zipper, a shoelace, and a buckle.  The doll also comes with a plastic clip so it can fasten to a bag, or even a belt loop, for travel.  The doll itself is a colorful patchwork kiddo, and my daughter was instantly taken with it (even though it was the boy doll instead of the girl doll).  While it is not quite as soft and cuddly as her most favorite stuffed dolls, and she has no real interest sleeping with it at night, it is a companion at home and the little button and shoelace features just beg to be played with.  And by playing she is (hopefully) developing those skills that she'll eventually use to tie her own shoes and button her shirts.As another reviewer pointed out, in the end this is a toy and does not offer a complete tutorial needed to master any of these skills.  For example, the zipper is pretty basic and just moves up and down.  It is permanently joined at the bottom of the jacket, so the hardest part of the zipping process is not really part of this.  The shoelace, on the other hand, offers the ability to actually practice that skill, though one might argue that it's bad to learn the skill backwards instead of on one's own shoe.  However, despite all of this, I find this to be an educational doll for curious youngsters who will play with it without realizing that they are learning in the process.  Recommended, especially for those kids old enough to want to do things on their own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37NZO1THJWUOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPB0LD6#wasThisHelpful","R37NZO1THJWUOG","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I approached this Sony HTST9 7.1 Sound Bar as someone who was still using a Sony 5.1 surround sound system purchased around 2004.  The difference is obviously night and day, and I was blown away by not only the sharpness and clarity of the sound but also by the relatively easy setup and its minimal footprint in our living room compared to what we had previously.  Our 5.1 system, which was pretty much top of the line in 2004, had a receiver, five wired speakers, and a wired subwoofer.  Cables ran along walls and under carpet, and the quality was great for a long time.  We had a short in our subwoofer a few years ago that changed that, but I was nonetheless very pleased for the better part of a decade.  In stark contrast, this system comes with a wireless subwoofer which is fantastic.  And I had a hard time accepting that the sound I was getting for a long sound bar was better than the strategically positioned speakers wired all around my living room.  In all honesty, it took far longer to take the old Sony system apart than it did to set up this fancy younger sibling.I have a family member who is skilled at electronics, and it took him only about half an hour to get this installed right out of the box.  (After we spent a hour or more pulling up wires and unhooking speakers to make way for this.)  We went through the software setup with ease, got everything set up with wifi, and I was able to use my iPhone to play music.  We tried out a handful of Blu Ray discs as well to test out the full spectrum of sound.  I am not an expert by any means, but I am a typical consumer who enjoys - with my family - a quality home theater experience in my living room.  There are likely much fancier units out there, but this one is sheer perfection for us.  We have long trusted the Sony brand since our very first, very large Sony DVD player way back in 1997.  This compact unit packs a punch and is light years better than what we had before.  Thus, this is highly recommended to folks looking for quality and clarity, wireless connectivity, and sleekness in a small unit that is very easy to setup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIVSF9R4PXOHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U78GFWW#wasThisHelpful","RIVSF9R4PXOHT","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Black & Decker LED desk light is great for a dorm room or a relaxed office. I say ""relaxed"" because it's sleek but not fancy, made of shiny black plastic that would not really go well with, say, a nice oak desk. I would not say it looks cheap exactly, but it's far more functional than aesthetically pleasing.As far as functionality, it really works well. Despite being a thin, lightweight desk lamp, the brightness of the LED fills up the room. You can read or work by this in a totally dark room without any difficulty. For me, it's perfect in our family room where I often escape to read while the kids are at play or in bed. The charging port for my smartphone is an absolute bonus. I attached a short six-inch lightning cable for my iPhone and I know have an accessible charger in my den.The phone stand is, well, less impressive. My iPhone 5S would fit just fine if I didn't have a case. If your phone is bare or protected by a super-thin back case (not a thicker wallet or certainly not an Otterbox), it'll fit fine in a vertical position. Otherwise, like me, you are out of luck and just have a little pool for paper clips or rubberbands instead. Seems like most people would want a stand to watch their phones horizontally but I don't see that as a real possibility here, but maybe with some maneuvering it would work. And speaking of maneuverability, this lamp is extremely adjustable.The off/on switch is super sensitive. I accidentally turned it on and off three or four times getting the light adjusted. It's a minor thing, but I tend to like more solid switches as opposed to these virtually invisible buttons that are barely marked with a small power icon.

"These are considered ""Little Boys"" jeans, but my seven-year-old daughter, who loves to wear boots, really enjoyed these.  She was ""amazed"" when these arrived as they were greenish in color, being forest denim.  She had apparently never seen green-tinted jeans before.  To her, of course, that made them even more cool.  She is seven and small for her age, yet these Wrangler boot-cut jeans fit her nicely around the waist.  We did roll them up at first and may eventually get them hemmed because they are longer than she needs at the moment.She has worn these on several occasions now, with and without her boots, and she has had nothing but positive comments.  She is a bit of a tomboy and these work well for her on the playground and around the house.  To me, they are soft to the touch yet clearly tough and sturdy - a very good quality product.  And I should point out that my daughter really likes the stitching on the rear, the stylized W for Wrangler.  She calls that ""sassy,"" though since these are made primarily for boys, I doubt that ""sassy"" was in the designers' minds.  All in all, these are great for tomboys as well as actual boys.

"I have never worn a Wrangler shirt, and I decided to try this one out because I really liked the color.  When it arrived I was struck by the rugged quality.  This is a nice-looking shirt that can be worn to the office, but it also be easily used for intensive outdoor activity on the weekend.  I guess that's what sportswear is all about.  As impressed as I was, my spouse took one look at it and suggested that I not wear it to work because of its size.  I always wear extra-large shirts and have for many years.  This extra-large was, unfortunately, larger than I expected.  I feel I could have easily worn a large instead, and ultimately that's the main downside to ordering any clothing online.I wore it to work regardless and received no feedback.  Tucked in, it worked just fine although the sleeves ballooned a bit because they are too long and too big for my frame.  In the future, I will definitely go with a large in Wrangler clothing instead of extra-large.  That would make a great deal of difference.  But in terms of quality and durability, I was very impressed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RKXB6HYJ768/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XH7IATG#wasThisHelpful","R1RKXB6HYJ768","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very beautiful and well-made sleigh and doll set from Mattel. My two daughters, ages 7 and 3, were extremely obsessed with ""Frozen"" all last year, and if they had this set during that intense period - back when the movie was on on our house every single day without fail - I suppose they would have never stopped playing with this set. A year later, their ""Frozen"" fever has cooled, but they still go excited when this arrived. Out came all the compatible Mattel dolls from last year to play with it. And that's one downside to a set like this. If you don't already have a couple of other dolls, or at least an Elsa doll, be prepared to pick one up. It makes no sense to include only one of the sisters here, though I do recognize that Elsa never really rode in the sleigh in the movie.The Anna doll is very nice and basically identical to the one my daughters already had on their own. Sven is a plastic character, not dissimilar to the various plastic horses or large dogs that accompany some of the more elaborate Barbie sets. The sleigh is richly detailed and was their favorite part. It can hold about three characters, or more depending on their size. Or in my daughters' case, a bunch if they just lay them down stack them up in the sleigh in true Monty Python style. Clearly they were having a blast.This is an easy recommendation for Frozen fans. It is worth noting,  for potential giftgiving, but this it does come in a brown cardboard box with the ""Frozen"" logo as opposed to the standard Barbie-type box, or at least that is how our set arrived.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDQ4D8JJ2GC13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAQ3ZFG#wasThisHelpful","RDQ4D8JJ2GC13","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan for decades, reading both the original stories and novels and subsequent portrayals by other authors (including the full works of youngest son Adrian Conan Doyle.) Here, though, is something completely different. ""Mycroft Holmes"" shines the light on the enigmatic older brother, minimizing Sherlock pretty much to a single, amusing chapter where we see him as a mediocre college student. I really enjoyed this book, despite a few shortcomings, and I really hope we see more of these from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and co-author Anna Waterhouse.In a sentence, here we see young government up-and-comer Mycroft set off on a historically-based mystery/adventure involving the Caribbean slave trade with a Watson-like companion, Cyrus Douglas. The characterization is vivid and the plot interesting, even if no one would ever mistake this for an original Conan Doyle novel. I have to say that the sixty-page stretch on the ocean liner was top notch, a set of thrilling and atmospheric chapters full of deduction and intrigue. Unfortunately that stretch comes before the novel's halfway point, meaning that it's a tiny bit downhill from there. The action-packed conclusion, a sort of Victorian era Rambo II, was exciting but also a bit much. It was satisfying, however, and left me eager for more.If you're a Holmes fan, this is worth a read. Even though Sherlock himself is little more than an extended cameo, it's wonderful to see brother Mycroft young and vulnerable, deftly and arrogantly using his mental abilities, as we readers smile, knowing what adventures lie in store.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S68LP1CXWTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783291532#wasThisHelpful","R2S68LP1CXWTD","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using the Slendertone Abs toner for a few weeks, and I was eager to give this Arms 7 muscle toner a try as well. I figured that it would be pretty much the same and easy for me to set up right out of the box. I was mostly correct.Unlike the Abs toner, which includes a trio of batteries, the Arms 7 requires a couple of hours to charge it's built-in battery unit before using. So while it wasn't quite ready to go straight from the box, it was ready as promised within 90 to 120 minutes. It's a little trickier to set up than the Abs toner. You're dealing with two arm units obviously, each of which contain two small gel pads to connect your bare skin to the unit. This is exactly like the Abs toner, but they're harder to accurately position I discovered. The Abs toner is pretty basic, and I got it first time (and every subsequent time) without difficulty. Here I struggled to put the arm bands on the first time. A partner would've helped initially. Then I had to readjust them twice, leaving my skin sore from all that peeling abs reapplying. The instructions offered tips to avoid tingling in the lower arms but regardless of my adjustments, I felt that mild-ish tingling about 8 of the 10 minutes. The sensation, just like with the Abs toner, is unique and takes some getting used to. I can feel it contracting my muscles, but after a couple rounds, I have to say it just wasn't quite as comfortable and emotionally satisfying as the Abs toner. I'll continue to use it, of course, as it takes weeks to see results.A couple of notes worth mentioning. The Abs toner recommends using it about five times per week, and I have been averaging six or even seven just because it has become a comfortable part of my morning routine. This Arms 7, however, should only be used thrice weekly, and 48 hours apart, according to the instructions. That surprised me, but honestly, since it is less comfortable and a bit more involved to set up, I am fine with that. Also, with the Abs belt I am free to walk around and do stuff. This unit offers less mobility because it's most comfortable, I found, to raise your arms or at least bend at the elbow. Also, the battery/control unit is handheld on a fairly short cord so that limits you as well. It's best to use this, I found, while sitting, maybe watching TV. (I'm active with the Abs belt, making the family breakfast and other morning stuff.)All in all, Slendertone is awesome. No doubt. This is my third product, and while it's not perfect and my least favorite of the three, I can feel it working and I feel good about myself in the process. If you have to choose, go with the Abs 3 toner. If you want the full package, give this Arms 7 a try as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKNEW73QYB7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011U19SX2#wasThisHelpful","RUKNEW73QYB7V","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been actively using the Slendertone Abs 3 for several weeks with good results, so I approached the Abs 5 primarily interested in what was different or better. I found that it delivered the same quality as the Abs 3 with only a few minor enhancements that will only affect experienced users (and even after a few weeks, I'm not yet ""experienced"" enough to benefit from these additions right out of the box.)The Abs 5 offers a total of 10 toning programs, compared to the 7 found on the Abs 3. This is great for long term users working their way up, though I am currently in the middle of program 3 do it'll be a while before I get beyond the maximum offered by the Abs 3. Additionally, the Abs 5 offers a maximum intensity of 130, compared with 99 on the Abs 3. After several weeks, I can say that I hit the 99 max only one time, usually stopping between 85 and 90. I can say that 99 is a powerful sensation, and I can only imagine the intensity of 130.Beyond these two minor differences, there's nothing at all differentiating the Abs 3 from this Abs 5. So if you're just getting started, as I was a while ago, the 3 is just as good, though this 5 is a better option for trainers or folks who are committed to the long haul, persistent daily use for the foreseeable future.The Abs 5, just like the 3, is easy to set up, and it even comes with a trio of batteries so you can get started right out of the box.  The device remembers your current program and advances automatically, so it's a no-brainer kind of workout, though it's up to you to increase your intensity each time as desired. The sensation is unique and indescribable, though once you get used to it, it is a comfortable yet intense feeling. And best of all, you know when it's working. If any of the three pads are misaligned, you feel it right away. Overall, I'm thrilled to have the Slendertone system in my life (as I also have the Arms 7). It's an incredible device that's changed the way I work out each day and impacted my goals and self esteem.  And while there is not much difference between the Abs 3 and the Abs 5, either of them are five-star and highly recommended products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFO824KOZF8V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0YTB1K#wasThisHelpful","RFO824KOZF8V8","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In addition to occasional leakage I've taken to wearing ""bladder protection"" during my monthly cycle, and to me that is a perfect test to the claims of odor control. I must say that Always gets an A there.  These are not my favorite, however, because of the fit.  When I first put them on I thought I had them on backwards since they felt funny, mostly with the front feeling higher than the back, but after checking the packaging I found that the purple waistband was in the back as directed.  In addition, the ""Advanced Triple Layer Core"" section seems a bit bunchy - it's not thick but long, and just doesn't seem to fit well.  I tried a small, so size wasn't a problem for the core.  It could have been for the legs holes, however.They feel a bit tight, despite the S/M claiming to go to 190 lbs.  The L is for 170-260 lbs, and I might be at the lower end of that range, but I'd fear that they would be too big if I tried the next size up.  The elastic around the legs seems to be tighter than other brands, so choose wisely when deciding on size.  Unlike other bladder protectors, I noticed this one throughout my day more often, just in the feel or uncomfortableness of it around my waist, hips, and thighs.  So for that I'd give these a C.  That said, I was perfectly comfortable where it matters most - never felt the slightest bit wet or sticky, so there's another A.  They are slightly nicer looking than the plain gray or pink plastic protection offered, but still not attractive by any means, so I'll give that a B. They still deserve an A for discreet, at least as far as keeping the fact we're wearing an adult diaper hidden from public.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LL8KUPDA7WSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTKW3Q4#wasThisHelpful","R2LL8KUPDA7WSS","A39H1GO9E3YQIB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H1GO9E3YQIB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Usually I'll have a pimple or two crop up while I'm trying a new product, but I was pleasantly surprised that, despite stress in my life at the moment, this did not happen.That said, after a week or two of using it regularly I did get a small one, but it was in a crevice where I probably did not rub it in well, so that was completely my fault.  I was also pleasantly surprised that it did not dry out my skin.  Granted, I only use it once a day, but I tend to have sensitive skin that quickly feels the effects of harsh cleansers.

"This Pyrex Easy Grab 28-piece set was well packaged with cardboard between pieces, though I had trouble digging out one of the lids. A few observations: the four smallest, more decorative pieces do not include lids, and the largest casserole style ones are not airtight like the others. I do like that those pieces have slits your for fingers, however.As with all Pyrex, these pieces are on the heavy side because of the thick glass, but they are definitely worth the weight. Two fell out of the box while I was unpacking them, onto wood flooring, and there was not a scratch or chip on either.The kids have washing/cooking reminders which are nice, and there are other accessories (cooling packs, carrying cases, etc) that can be purchased for potluckers. These will take up a lot of room, but they will help give current cookware a break.All in all, this was a good first experience with Pyrex.

"This book totally lived up to my hopes. The recipes are easy and mostly quick to prepare, and all the ones I've tried have been very tasty. For each one, the authors explain what it does from a Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective (e.g., strengthens the kidneys, drains dampness) and which health issues you can use it for (e.g., losing weight, or recovering from illness). You can use the index to look for a recipe by ingredient or by health issue. They also give you variations on each recipe. I have even made up my own recipes based on the information/ingredients presented in the book.Ancient Wisdom, Modern Kitchen is written from the perspective that food = nutrition = medicine. You can enjoy it simply as a cookbook of East Asian dishes, or as a component in a healthier lifestyle (the recipes are mostly quite low fat and feature lots of veggies, herbs, and whole grains), or as therapeutic for specific conditions.The only drawback--and this isn't a problem with the book but with trying to eat an Asian-style diet in the USA--is that some of the ingredients can be hard to source and rather expensive. The authors do their best to help by giving you pictures of ingredients that may be unfamiliar, as well as showing their names written in Chinese so you can recognize them from the packaging. I happen to live in a city without a good Asian market though, and have found it difficult to get some of the herbs locally. They can be ordered online, but some (like ginseng) can be really pricey. However, this is your health we're talking about, so it's up to you whether that's worth the cost. Most of the recipes can be made without hard-to-obtain ingredients and they'll still be tasty food, albeit maybe not as medicinal. I just gradually add things to my pantry, one at a time.For Westerners who might be wondering how these Asian medicinal ingredients will taste, the ones I've been able to get my hands on have been mild and pleasant tasting. I routinely add astragalus root, jujubes (Chinese red dates), maitake and/or shiitake mushrooms, pearl barley (Job's tears), and goji berries to my soups and stews now, and no one who has tried them thinks there is anything weird about the taste. I think they add good flavor, but in a subtle and not overpowering way. Ginseng is also very tasty. If you already like Chinese, Japanese, or Korean food I don't think you have anything to worry about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQFOCRDA8AE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=073821325X#wasThisHelpful","RSQFOCRDA8AE9","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the book on Egyptian cosmology I have always been looking for! I've been interested in Egyptian (and other) mythology since I was a kid, but after a while I got frustrated because every book was just a bunch of pretty pictures and lists of So-and-so was the god of Such-and-such. Sometimes you get some interesting tales, but there was never anything about the theology, the cosmology, the philosophy, and the worldview that held it all together.That's where this book differs. It is all about that stuff that knits a culture together. It sounds a little cliche, but it really did bring the ancient Egyptian mind to life for me. As it stands, I found Temple of the Cosmos to be very well-reasoned, well-researched, and a pleasure to read. Although it is not an academic work, it is certainly scholarly. Naydler supports his arguments with specific ancient texts and/or images. He strikes the right balance between (apparently) accepting that mystical experiences and phenomena are real, without bias toward the ""truth"" of any one worldview, Egyptian or otherwise. By comparison, the ""methodological atheism"" required in academic writing means that an author must discuss spiritual beliefs/phenomena as if they aren't real, regardless of their actual opinion on the matter, and that means they can't really engage with the deeper levels of the topic; on the other hand, for an author to accept ""transmitted"" information as accurate a priori would be without intellectual, philosophical, or scholarly rigor. Naydler does not succumb to either pitfall.Temple of the Cosmos covers stories of creation, the Egyptian concept of magic as both a cosmic force and a skill set which overlapped with pretty much every aspect of life, Egyptian concepts of time, space, cosmos, and geography, the understanding of the individual spirit/psyche/soul, and the afterlife journey. If you are a student of Western magic you will recognize a lot of the themes here. While it is clear that the Egyptian worldview was very different from that of the 21st century West, you do get a feel for Egypt's massive influence at the very roots of our civilization.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in: Egyptology, history, anthropology, and archaeology; ancient Egypt generally; Egyptian mythology; Kemetic reconstructionism or Kemetic-inspired paganism; Western philosophy; and/or magic and the Western Mystery/Magical Tradition. If you are looking for someone's unverified personal gnosis of Egyptian deities, this is not the book you are looking for (but I would still recommend it).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10SQDJSEPKG7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0892815558#wasThisHelpful","R10SQDJSEPKG7I","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this tea because it is supposed to help support the spleen. According to Chinese medicine, my spleen qi is weak. It's also supposed to help you lose weight (weak spleen qi can lead to obesity) which I wanted to do.This tea seems to give me lots of energy without any caffeine buzz feeling, and in turn that has allowed me to get more exercise.The taste is like a very bland tea, much like what you'd get as the default tea at a Chinese restaurant. I find it very easy to drink. Among other things, bojenmi tea contains hawthorn, which supports the heart, balances blood pressure, and reduces cholesterol. I have read that bojenmmi can be laxative, but in my personal experience it has not had that effect.I've been drinking the tea for about 2 months now, during which time I have lost 8 lbs. I am eating better and exercising a bit more so this is probably not due to the tea alone, but I do think it has helped. It's recommended to drink 3 cups per day and I usually only drink 1 or 2, so I might have lost more if I had drunk more tea.

"I found this book to be quite interesting, but in terms of getting what I was looking for, I didn't quite live up to my hopes. I got the book because I'm interested in taking a Chinese medical approach to some chronic health issues that conventional medicine has been unable to help me with, one of which is weight loss. If you're thinking of buying, here are some things you might like to know:The book claims to be ""the Asian diet secret,"" but it's not really Asian. It's a fusion of Chinese and Western approaches to diet, with a little Ayurveda thrown in. The energy types symbolized by animals (dragon, bear, crane, tiger) are inspired by Qigong, but are actually categories created by the author. Hadady explains how they fit with Chinese elemental theory, and says she chose animals as more relatable than elements like earth, water, metal, etc., and I do think that was a clever way of categorizing the types.I also like the way this book takes account of the fact that people have differing motivations with regard to food choices, and differing energy levels, etc. (for example, bears crave sweets, dragons crave salt and have poor adrenal function, cranes are prone to addictions) so that they need to take different approaches to weight loss. I love that she suggests menus specifically for each type. I thought it was cool that she suggested homeopathic remedies (although I tried the one she suggested for people with my issues and it had no effect that I could discern), though I was surprised she didn't recommend more Chinese herbal formulas--perhaps because they would have to be more specifically tailored to the individual? I don't know.Where the book falls short, for me, is in the following:- I wanted to see more Chinese medicine theory to explain how obesity develops and is treated, and why certain foods are chosen or avoided. There really is no ""Asian diet secret"" here at all, just a blend of non-secret Chinese approaches and non-secret Western ones.- Sometimes the author doesn't explain very well. For example, in Chinese nutrition theory, salads and raw veg are not considered good for you because they are cold and stress your spleen and digestion. Hadady mentions this. Yet in her daily menus, she suggests everyone eat lots of salads. So, which is it? She also says that you should only eat one type of protein per day, and every kind of meat is a separate type. So if you eat dairy at breakfast you can only eat dairy as your protein for the rest of the day. She says that mixing proteins is bad, but never says why. I'm left wondering if there is some basis for this claim, or if it's just superstition.- The ""baseline diet"" is just an ordinary calorie- and fat-restricted diet with some added idiosyncracy like the thing with only one type of protein per day, and in fact it's pretty restrictive. It does suggest a lot of tea which, if you drink as much as is recommended (more than 64 oz per day), will leave you with little room left for actual food. So I'm sure that diet will be effective in helping you lose weight, but I am not at all convinced that very many people can maintain it long term.- A lot of the recommended foods sound, not to put too fine a point on it, unpleasant to gross. I mean, if you're trying to lose weight you know there's going to be some ""rabbit food"" involved. Also, in Chinese medicine it is understood that a person who is out of balance (e.g., overweight) will tend to crave things that throw their body even more out of balance; however once their health is balanced, they will crave things that tend to keep it that way. So I expected that I would be advised to eat some things I don't really want to, and be advised against eating things I feel instinctively drawn to. But warmed-over pumpkin puree from a can? Plain cold tofu? Hadady's idea of dessert is a spoonful of coconut oil. I like coconut and I use the oil in cooking, but the mere thought of choking down a spoonful of raw oil makes me queasy. (I did actually try it. Will not be making that mistake again.) If these are my choices I honestly would rather not eat at all. (Maybe that's the plan?) There are recipes included in the book and there are a few I think I'll try, but none was particularly inspiring.- The author is really into laxatives and ""cleansing."" Cleansing is all the rage right now but is not necessary for most people and can be dangerous. In Chinese medicine, one of the causes of obesity is weak digestive qi and as I understand it--I'm not an expert but have been doing a lot of research--these cleanses could actually diminish your qi. It just seems like this should have been reserved for a different book.- Depending on where you live, some of Hadady's recommended foods and supplements may not be easy to find. I live in a town with one small Korean grocery that has only a few recommended things. This means I have to order things online and with shipping costs that puts them out of my reach.BOTTOM LINE:I feel confident that if I followed the baseline diet and guidelines in this book, I would lose weight. I feel equally confident that I will not be able to follow the baseline diet. It isn't so much because of what you're NOT supposed to eat that I would fall off the wagon as because of the things you ARE supposed to eat. However, I did learn from the book and I applaud the author's ambitious attempt to create a synthesis of Chinese and Western nutrition. The book did help me get a better handle on the imbalances in how I eat and what I need to do to correct them, and inspired me to drink more herbal tea. I think if you are serious about losing weight, this book can help you, but will probably not be enough on its own.If you get this book, I would also recommend getting the cookbook Ancient Wisdom, Modern Kitchen by Yuan Wang, Warren Sheir, and Mika Ono, which has recipes selected according to Chinese medicine which are quick, easy, and tasty (no canned pumpkin required!). Almost all the recipes in the cookbook are designed to support the spleen and digestion which, in Chinese medicine, is supposed to help you lose weight. They also explain why each ingredient is recommended, and suggest variations, so you could even figure out your own recipes once you get used to the Asian ingredients.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQJDJVB3B9M38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594864144#wasThisHelpful","RQJDJVB3B9M38","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very small book. It's 93 pages (not counting a list of merchants in the back), with large margins, fairly large print, lots of large illustrations, and the pages are only about 5 or 5 and a half inches square. It's sort of like a novelty child-sized coffee table art book.The content is fine, and the book was priced inexpensively, but I wish I had realized just how small and brief this book was. I read it in one short sitting, and though I consider myself a beginner where natural perfumery is concerned, pretty much everything in this book I had already found online. There is a section on the history of solid perfume which is ridiculously brief.That said, there's certainly nothing wrong with the book's contents or the quality of the editing and binding, and I will check out Mandy Aftel's other books in hopes of getting a more substantial meal. And it's my fault that I didn't pay attention to the info on dimensions, page count, etc. that Amazon provides. But I think this just should have been published as a pamphlet or an e-book.

"This book was loaned to me by a family member who really loved it and thought I would really love it too. I have never read anything else by Elizabeth Gilbert but reading the back cover blurb I thought the book sounded right up my alley.Highly intelligent female protagonist? Check. Historical setting in a time of huge social and technological transformations? Check. World travel? Check. Encounters with the ""mysteries of evolution"" coupled with ""the spiritual, the divine, and the magical""? Check, check, check. Botany? Check. Heck, it even had moss! I actually LOVE moss!The writing is not great literature but is page-turning and engaging. The background historical setting was very interesting; in fact, the most brilliant thing about the book was having its protagonist born in 1800 so we could travel through the 19th century with her. (In spite of what the gadget-sellers want you to believe, the scientific, technological, and social changes of the 19th century were far more momentous than anything since. Some of those changes, of course, have led us down dark roads. But I digress.) As a female nerd and plant lover, I initially identified with the protagonist, Alma, and was really hoping to see her have worldview-changing insights from which I too would learn. I even put up with that hackneyed old trope, the Manic Pixie Dream Girl (Retta). The promise of learning more about botany within the context of 19th century history kept me reading even through the subsequent appearance of a Manic Pixie Dream Boy (Ambrose).In any other book, I would have chucked it at that point. It's weak to use one Manic Pixie Dream Person character, but TWO? That's just lazy or condescending or both. But it seemed like maybe this MPDBoy would be developed into a real character, one that would finally push Alma to experience real growth and transformation. I mean after all, the author had gone so far as to switch up the usual gender of the MPDPerson... maybe that would be a good sign?Alas, it was not to be. The MPDBoy remained a cardboard cutout. Even worse, although we are repeatedly assured of his incomparable artistic genius and his beautiful soul, in the end we're told that his mind was ""weak"" and ""fragile"" and it is even implied that such people can't hack it under the conditions of natural selection. This felt like a cynical trick--at least in most stories with an MPD character, he or she (well, she) is portrayed as wondrous and magical throughout. Here it's like we're promised wonder, and then told it's just mental instability after all. I mean, the entire reason authors fall back on MPD characters is to allow their main characters to have insights and become liberated without having to do the difficult inner work, so what was the point here?Speaking of cynical, when Alma finally has her big scientific realization, it's so cynical that I felt like a lot more explanation was needed to show me how she could remain so blithe about it. I mean, nowadays such views are dominant to the point of being normative, but in the mid-19th century most people found them shocking. So perhaps Alma wouldn't have been shocked, given her life experiences, but I would have expected her to be depressed, frankly. There is one aspect of her hypothesis that she just can't make sense of (the Prudence Problem) yet frustratingly, we're not even given a peek into what the protagonist THINKS about it. Surely she has some guesses? Some further hypotheses? No.There is a very problematic meta-narrative as well, according to which large and homely women are unlovable, undesirable, morally complex and ambivalent, while beautiful people (Retta, Prudence, Tomorrow Morning, Ambrose) are virtuous and good even when (as in TM's and Retta's cases) we're told they have done stuff that maybe isn't all that virtuous or (as in Retta's and Ambrose's cases) we are told they are plumb loco. I think this meta-narrative is a side effect of the fact that only the protagonist is developed enough to have any complexity--the rest are more props to the story. But sometimes messages find their way into a story without the author's full conscious intent, and that's what bothers me here. Besides curiosity, the dominant emotion in the protagonist seems to be shame. Other characters even shame her further, sometimes about things she couldn't possibly have known or done anything about. Pretty = good, ugly = morally suspect and shameful, over and over. Like THAT concept needs any reinforcement in our society. Even the ugly dog is kind of a jerk (although I had more sympathy for him than almost anyone else in the story.) It all left an icky taste in my mouth.In the end, the insights and transformations I was hoping for in Alma just never materialized. Through the entire course of her life, her worldview remains largely unperturbed, even through culture shock, bereavements, and a supposedly deep involvement with a character who seemed--at least until we are told, never mind, he's just delusional--to be blasting through the boundaries of that worldview. But in order for a character to experience such insights, the author has to have had them. And it seems like Gilbert hasn't. Because of this, Alma's unquestioned devotion to scientific materialism felt less like a commitment to rigorous historical accuracy on Gilbert's part, and more like an unreflexive backwards projection of what has become the normative and paradigmatic worldview of OUR time. (To be clear, I was not hoping for Alma to have an out-of-character religious conversion--but I would have liked a little ontological crisis.)BOTTOM LINE: The writing is pleasant, but the story failed to deliver on its potential. I found the setting more engaging and realistic than the plot or characters. To write what I consider a really good novel--the kind that I will keep and re-read--an author has to have traversed some ""dark night of the soul"" and be willing to revisit that in various ways through their characters. Either Gilbert hasn't been there, or she didn't want to go back there, and as a result her characters didn't go anywhere. I'd give this book 2.5 stars if that were an option.P.S. On a positive note, in part because of this book I was directed to the works of Robin Wall-Kimmerer, which look very promising.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JON30XW43Q9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143125842#wasThisHelpful","R2JON30XW43Q9N","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Note: Some of this review is paraphrased from a comment I left on another review.]I love everything I've read by Murakami, some books more than others. Hard-Boiled Wonderland is one of my favorites. I respect the many and varied opinions of the deeper meaning of his texts, but I don't subscribe to any of these interpretations. To me, his stories read like an unusual individual exploring all the weird corners of imagination, without being bound by the conventions of linear storytelling--no more, no less. A lot of it reads like an acid trip.I believe that to fully enjoy Murakami's books, it's best not to bring any expectations to them. Don't believe the hype, don't expect him to be representative of ""Japanese culture"" (haha good luck with that), don't expect to find the same ""meaning"" as other reviewers (or indeed any meaning at all), don't expect them to be like typical Western novels, don't even expect the plot line to be wrapped up at the end or the mysteries to be solved. Just go along for the ride.Regarding Murakami as some kind of representative of Japaneseness (which seems to be a common belief among Americans), this is a ridiculous expectation to begin with. First of all, how would you generalize or boil down a culture that produced the tea ceremony AND their variety shows? Hello Kitty AND harakiri? No culture can be fully represented by a single writer, Japan even less than most, and Murakami isn't even trying to do that anyway. However, his books are very popular in Japan so it's clear that they do resonate with people there. Murakami's books are Japanese to the extent that their author happens to be Japanese; but they are individual and unique to the extent that their author is individual and unique.There is a lot of hype in the West about how ""cool"" Murakami's books are. This is just publisher hype. What they are is a glorious mashup of unpredictable, confusing, anti-heroic, enchanting, frustrating, bewildering, magical, campy, disaffected, Western, Eastern, creepy, vivid, funny, noir, and quirky, in equal measures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZGKS84XQ4Y6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AP9W1O#wasThisHelpful","RZGKS84XQ4Y6Y","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is...different. I got this book because I love Matthew Wood's other writing on herbalism, and because he covers some herbs here that I don't often see elsewhere. However, the basic premise of the book was not clear to me when I bought it--if I had known more about that, I would still have bought the book but there are others I'd have read first. So I will outline the premise here for prospective buyers:The format is based on the pedagogical concept of the Ojibwe Grand Medicine Lodge, where students advance through seven stages or grades, each of which centers around one plant. However, the exact plants and medicinal lore involved are not shared outside Ojibwe culture (Wood is not Ojibwe) and maybe there is no one left alive who even knows all of it. So instead of the original seven Ojibwe plants, Wood provides seven American plants that have emerged as important in his own practice; and instead of the Ojibwe medicinal lore, Wood interprets seven chapters of Genesis and relates these stories to the plant teachings. Another important factor to consider is that this is really a book about homeopathy, not traditional herbalism.If you identify as a Christian homeopath or herbalist I bet you will really dig this book. Even if you don't agree with Wood's take on the scriptures, his views are interesting and you will probably find them thought-provoking.If you are not Christian and/or not especially interested in Biblical literature, you might just want to skim those parts or else be really patient and try to view them as heuristic models.I liked the uniqueness of the approach. This particular work was written almost 30 years ago and I think Wood's approach and understanding of the plants have evolved and become more holistic since then. As I mentioned, at the time this book was written Wood was obviously more a homeopath than herbalist: For example, at the end he insists that of the seven stages discussed, you can only be in one at a time and therefore only need one of those plants at a time. Using only one plant at a time, which is linked to a very specific set of physical, psychological, and emotional characteristics even down to the patient's appearance, is characteristic of homeopathy. However, elsewhere he says that the stages are cumulative as well as sequential and thus all exist at the same time. Hmm. This is not a book that can easily be used to diagnose yourself; at least, I found that more than one of the chapters/plants seemed to potentially apply to me, so I wouldn't self-treat just based on what's in this book.In the final analysis, I think that tying the herbal-medical teachings in with lessons from Biblical literature is a brilliant model IF you assume the audience was raised fully immersed in and conversant with Christian theology (especially of a Protestant variety)--because the particular lessons embodied in those Bible stories are culturally-specific. I don't happen to embrace those particular moral values, and am skeptical that plants do. So I felt like the herbs were being forced to fit the Old Testament exegesis, and that doesn't quite work for me. It was certainly interesting and I will probably keep the book as a reference, but it's not in my opinion one of Wood's better works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYCNQCFIDRCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0938190911#wasThisHelpful","RMYCNQCFIDRCR","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would actually have given this 3.5 stars if that were possible.What I like about this deck:--It has an ""old timey"" (mid-1800s) Victorian style and the pips remind me of the playing cards they use in Spain. Not exactly ""ancient"" in any way, but if you want something that feels vintage, this is a good deck. The images of the Major Arcana are based on Renaissance Italian decks, but are more colorful.--They are a little longer and narrower than my other tarot decks--in fact, they are as long as my small hands can easily handle--but I like the shape.--Another reviewer commented that the back of the cards doesn't fit with the front (while the fronts have a slightly off-white, old paper tone, the backs were green and a very new-looking bright white). This has been fixed. The backs are dark green, sage green, and gold, and fit well with the fronts.--This is my first deck that isn't a Rider-Waite clone, and I specifically sought out a deck that didn't have scenes for the minor arcana. This deck has just the number and the suit, and I like that. For beginners, it might be easier to start with a RW clone.--They have a smooth finish and seem thick enough without being too stiff.What I don't like:--The Little White Book was pretty much useless (as expected). I recycled it. I didn't buy the deck for the LWB, so that's ok.--The cards came out of the box with a *very* strong nasty chemical/plastic odor, and it appears that I am allergic to something used in their manufacture. Every time I use the deck, my nose runs and swells up and I get a headache. I spread the cards out on a table and put a bag of bamboo charcoal in the middle and that seems to have absorbed a bit of the odor, but I've had these cards probably a month and they are still off-gassing like crazy. I can't do more than 2 spreads at a sitting before I have to stop. If it doesn't clear up soon they will have to stay outside until they finish off-gassing. If you have any chemical sensitivity, steer clear of these! (In fact, I would be wary of anything made by Lo Scarabeo, as I have read other complaints online about the smell and having to let the cards air out before using them. This deck came wrapped in cellophane inside the box, and there was no detectable odor until the cellophane was removed, so I think the smell comes from the inks or the coating of the cardstock.) If not for this, I would have given this deck 5 stars, but this seems like a consistent problem with Lo Scarabeo decks, and it makes me wonder what they heck they put on their cards. However many people say it doesn't bother them.UPDATE: The smell did finally go away, and now I enjoy using this deck. I have read that the smell comes from linseed oil used in the printing process but I have no idea if that's accurate. Some people say they actually like the Lo Scarabeo ""new deck smell,"" so your mileage may vary. But if you are very sensitive to smells, be prepared.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JIEZZBMTDR6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738700266#wasThisHelpful","R1JIEZZBMTDR6F","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read some of Josephine McCarthy's writings online, but this was the first book I've purchased so far (there will be more). This book is definitely going on my reference shelf to stay. As is typical of McCarthy's writing, there is just a huge amount of useful information delivered in a succinct, no-nonsense, down to earth style. When you understand the (sometimes negative) effect magic can have on your body and why it happens, you have only to learn some basic techniques to begin taking charge of your health. This is not to say it's easy, necessarily--but it is pretty simple. You will NOT find ""cookbook"" style spells that sound cute but don't explain why or how they are supposed to work, or worse yet seem to be designed to just make you feel clever and pretty. You will NOT need a fancypants altar or a bunch of tools. Instead you will find a variety of tarot spreads with a real life example to guide you in interpreting them; recommendations for complementary therapies including homeopathy and herbs, among others; and most importantly, visionary magic techniques.My favorite thing about McCarthy's presentation of magic is that she boils it down to the essentials, without any pompous fol-de-rol or attempts to scare the reader. It seems to occupy the space in between esoteric ceremonial magic and the more earthy practices of witchcraft, which I personally adore. For years I steered clear of magic because I couldn't find anyone taking this kind of approach.The methods in the book are as appropriate for relative beginners as for more advanced practitioners. If you haven't taken a magical hit yet, get this book so you can avoid it; if you have, then you probably already know you need a book like this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NPQTJWMHG2Q8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940671434#wasThisHelpful","R3NPQTJWMHG2Q8","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard about this collection from a friend of mine and was immediately intrigued by the premises of some of the stories. But I ended up reading Throne of the Crescent Moon by the same author first. I enjoyed that, so sought out Engraved on the Eye. I don't generally read short story collections, because when they're good, they're awesome--but usually they aren't. And that's so disappointing. But Ahmed's stories are very creative. He really has some unique ideas. I also enjoy the fact that his writing draws on a generally Middle Eastern cultural context, instead of being yet another medieval-Europe-but-with-dragons kind of fantasy. In this regard I especially liked Mister Hadj's Sunset Ride and The Faithful Soldier, Prompted. The writing does not absolutely wow me, but is pretty good.

"I got this deck (twice, actually--my dog ate the first one) because I enjoy Stephanie Pui-Mun Law's artwork and was able to preview the cards on her website before buying. I like the intricacy and grace of the illustrations. To me they feel very feminine, in a pleasing way. The colors are translucent, soft watercolors. The imagery is what I consider very optimistic and upbeat--for example, The Tower is more pretty than catastrophic, and while The Fool is still precariously balanced, she looks more like she's dancing joyfully in full awareness of her position than about to walk blindly off a cliff. Nevertheless, I have had a good rapport with this deck and have always gotten accurate readings, and they didn't feel too twee or cutesy. It works for me as well as any RWS-clone, with the added benefit that I find the art pretty.As mentioned, the deck is a Rider-Waite clone, and thus easy to interpret if you're already familiar with the RWS symbolism. The card stock is good quality (though delicious to dogs, apparently) and my cards have held up well. I've had my deck for about three and a half years, and as it is my workhorse deck, I use it frequently. I find the size of the cards fits my small hands well.But tarot decks get energetically gunky after prolonged and heavy use, and it's past time to retire my deck. I've decided to try a different one this time around. I am starting to find the RWS-clones to be somewhat limiting. It's hard to keep your interpretation from being influenced to some extent by the artist's interpretation of the card. And while that is also true of the original RWS, if you want exactly those card meanings I guess you have to read with the original. This means that the artist has a lot of power over your reading, and many artists are not tarot readers (I have no idea if Law is) nor are they working with esotericists or occultists in the design of the card. So however beautiful the imagery may be, sometimes it doesn't feel like there's any meaning behind it. I find this to be especially bothersome with the Minors, which really don't need narrative images at all. Inevitably, in every RWS clone deck, there is at least one card where the artist has departed too much from the RWS original, and not for the better, and over time it starts to really bug you. In this deck, The Moon, the 7 of Cups, and the 9 of Wands are those cards for me. (On the other hand, I feel like Law really nailed it with The Star.)I found the book that came with this deck to not be at all helpful, though it might be so for a beginner, I don't know. I would recommend getting a book that's not attached to a specific deck if you need one for interpretation (or use the internet judiciously). This book was a little too-Llewellyn, if you know what I mean. I believe it is now possible to buy this deck without any book.In summary, this is a beautiful deck which is easy to read. It suffers from the same shortcomings of all RWS clones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27VQQVXLYCFNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738727326#wasThisHelpful","R27VQQVXLYCFNV","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the artwork of this deck. I tend to like old-fashioned looking decks, and I like medieval and early Renaissance art, so this deck really appealed to me. I also love the soft, earthy color scheme. LIke most of the decks out there, it's an RWS clone, so is easy to interpret if you're already familiar with Rider-Waite. The card stock is nice, durable but not too stiff, the edges of the cards are gilt, and the deck comes in a really sturdy box. In short, with this deck, you get an old feel, but with more colors and detail and a little more luxe quality than with, say, a Marseilles or Visconti-Sforza deck. All of which, on paper, is perfect for me.But (and here is why I took one star off)...For me at least, it's a really grumpy deck. If you're an experienced tarot reader, you may have found that different decks have different ""feels"" to them. I have heard from other readers who've experienced this, but I don't know if a deck's ""feel"" is the same for everyone, or varies from person to person. The latter explanation makes more sense to me because everything else about reading is particular to the relationship between the reader and his or her deck. Anyway, for whatever reason, with this deck my readings all seemed to feel gloomy and defeatist.Also--and this is an issue with any of the collaged-art decks based on old images (such as the equally if not even more beautiful Golden Botticelli deck, or the Golden Tarot of Klimt)--the artist is composing their artwork from a limited collection of images, and sometimes the images they choose just don't quite seem to fit the card meaning. It's usually a reasonable interpretation based on the RWS-system, but it always bugs me. With the Golden Tarot, Strength, Justice, and The Chariot just don't quite do it for me, even though they have the right ingredients...they're just not arranged the right way. But I think this is an issue with every RWS clone, really.I haven't looked at the booklet that comes with the deck (the ""Little White Book"" or LWB) in many moons and don't even know if I still have it. I don't remember anything about it.In summary, it's a beautiful, well-made deck and easy to read if you know RWS symbolism. It has the same drawbacks and benefits of any RWS clone. Yet I almost never use it because it feels so sullen and gloomy. It might be just me. Or not. I don't know.

"I found this book totally charming and a refreshing take on tidying/de-cluttering. I had a look at some of the negative reviews and in my opinion many of these stem from a shallow reading coupled with unfamiliarity with Japanese culture and living conditions. While I don't claim to be an expert on Japanese culture, I have been there multiple times and visited ordinary Japanese apartments and homes so I am familiar with the typical architecture and home layout. Some things that might help you decide whether the book is for you:Bear in mind that this book was originally written for a Japanese audience. For me, that was one of the most charming things about it. I loved getting a different cultural perspective on organization. The Japanese generally live in very tiny dwellings (by American standards) so I figured if anyone would know how to declutter and organize effectively it would be a Japanese tidying expert.It appears, however, that some other readers are not so comfortable with a non-Western perspective. I see some reviewers mocking the notion that ""inanimate"" objects have feelings. In Japan, these things are not considered ""inanimate."" Hence you'll see signs asking that you not walk on the grass because it will hurt the grass' feelings, or not to dispose of cigarette butts in the street for the same reason. I'm not saying every Japanese person believes this (anymore than every American Christian goes to church), but there are those who sincerely believe objects are animate, in accordance with Shinto tradition, and Kondo seems to be one of them. If you don't share that belief, just use it as a psychological or imaginative exercise or something.Some of the basic ideas behind the ""KonMari"" system have been described in press reports about the book. If all you want are the basic guidelines without any context or explanation of why they should be used, don't buy the book, just search for a couple articles about it on the internet. But the method is quite different from conventional wisdom (an oxymoron if ever there was one) about tidying and organization, so I needed to understand the reasoning behind it. Like many people, I have tidied a zillion times in my life and it never sticks.Most of all, this is not just a book with some handy home organization tips. It is not about the daily (more or less) cleanup that comes with living. It's not Martha Stewart. Note the ""Life-Changing"" part of the title--that's the point of the book. Bringing your material possessions, your home, and your desired lifestyle into alignment through consciously changing your relationship with stuff. If that sounds good to you, you'll enjoy this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSCKSGTJDJ78Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KK0PICK#wasThisHelpful","RSCKSGTJDJ78Z","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, whenever I'm thinking of buying a book, I read the negative reviews first. They are much more revealing than the positive ones--frequently they are revealing not so much of the book's quality or content as they are of the assumptions readers bring. And so it seems to be with Solomon's books. I know this review is kind of long--the next paragraph plus the last one are my quickie summary review; if you want more specifics read the 3rd paragraph too.If I could give half-stars, I'd give this 3.5. The information is useful (albeit really dense in places...but we're talking about soil amendment recipes here, so, you know) but it's not entirely practical especially if you're low on capital at the outset. What specifically was useful? Solomon's basic argument is that plants contain nutrients derived from the soil, ergo if the soil is low in nutrients so are your vegetables. Plants are more than N, P, and K. They may look ok, you may even have good yields, but wit modern soils they are not as nutritious as they should be. Now this may not be an earth-shattering revelation (although many reviewers are surprisingly resistant to the concept...see below), but Solomon couples it with some suggestions on how to test your soil nutrient levels, how to improve them (this is where the big expense may come in, depending on your situation), and also challenges gardening orthodoxy that suggests that veggies will be nutritionally perfect as long as they're organic. The reason I deducted 1.5 stars is that after reading the book one may not be in a position to apply what they learned; which maybe is not the author's fault, but it could arguably have been addressed in the book...perhaps a chapter on ""What to do if you can't access such-and-such or can't afford to shell out hundreds of dollars on amendments or can't wait three years to build your soil.""Apparently gardening is a topic like health and diet in that everybody seems to think theirs is the Only Right Way to Do It. (This goes for Solomon too, although I think he's mostly right.) The #1 thing that strikes me about the negative reviews on Solomon is that people base their ideas on a very faulty understanding of the history of agriculture. I keep seeing the claim that people have been gardening for millennia and doing just fine without adding the amendments Solomon recommends (see reviews on Gardening When It Counts for more of the same), but this is simply not true. It is because of the bad methods used in the past that we are now reaping the whirlwind of nutrient-depleted soil. People have always done the best they could, but for most of history humans have not known about things like microscopic organisms in the soil or mycorrhizae, etc. ""Put poop on it and keep digging until nothing grows there anymore"" was basically the rule, until it was replaced in the 20th century by ""put chemicals on it and keep digging until nothing grows there anymore."" Analysis of skeletal remains shows that compared to ancient hunter-gatherers, agriculture resulted in people with rotten crooked teeth, stunted growth, crippling arthritis, and yes, major nutrient deficiencies. Remember rickets and scurvy? They still exist, you know. THIS HAS BEEN TRUE SINCE THE INCEPTION OF AGRICULTURE 10,000+ YEARS AGO AND IS STILL TRUE TODAY. Just because we're accustomed to it doesn't mean it's ""natural"" let alone optimal. Gardening and agriculture should never be compared to ""nature"" because they are examples of human INTERFERENCE with natural processes for our own ends. (This doesn't mean they are necessarily bad--but we need to be realistic.) Meanwhile, I also see many reviews saying Solomon's method is wrong because so-and-so does something different and their plants produce just fine--but unless they are doing a chemical analysis of the nutrient levels in their food, they can't compare their results to Solomon's, because he's not talking about yield, but nutritional content. It's comparing apples to oranges (har har).Conclusion: I'm a pretty inexperienced gardener. I haven't been able to apply all of Solomon's recommendations. But I accept his basic premises based on my very rudimentary knowledge of botany and my somewhat less rudimentary knowledge of history. if you accept the abundant scientific data, archaeological remains, and historical records that show our soils are badly eroded and depleted of nutrients; if you accept that plants get their nutrients from that soil and therefore soil chemistry is the limiting factor in how nutritious your plants can be; if you want your veggies to be as nutritious as possible; and if you are willing to read a book that is dense and has formulae and stuff, then you'll benefit from this one. If on the other hand you are already convinced your way of gardening is the Right Way, why are you even buying books on the subject? Just go do your thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PMJUK2DLSAQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0865717184#wasThisHelpful","R2PMJUK2DLSAQY","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm always interested in books on herbology/herbalism. With this one I flipped to the ""Celtic Roots"" section on a lark, and it was so full of historical mistakes that I cannot bring myself to read the rest of the book. In just the first 1 1/2 pages of that section, I counted 6 blatant falsehoods and 3 highly questionable statements. If the herbal information is as inaccurate as the ""history"", you would probably end up poisoned. Example: It says the honking of the sacred geese saved Rome from being pillaged by Celts in 390 BC. Nope, the city was *spectacularly* and famously pillaged and forced to pay tribute, and the fear of future ""barbarian"" incursions was part of what motivated Rome's expansionist policy into temperate Europe (as a result of which millions of Celts were killed or enslaved, if Caesar is to be believed).This is just one example of MANY. In my opinion, mistakes this elementary are completely inexcusable. As an anthropologist and archaeologist myself, I was horrified to see that the author is or claims to be an anthropologist and a professor! These are not things that only an expert on Celtic archaeology would know--they are basic, introductory-level European history/archaeology. Even Wikipedia could have set Storl right on some of these points.Maybe you're thinking, well, who cares if the author got all his historical details right? Isn't this supposed to be about herbalism? First, it shows that at least on some topics, the author has not done any research at all. If he's going to be this sloppy and careless about the history, how do I know he's put any more effort into any other part of the book? Second, in reading the other reviews, I saw how excited people were about the ""history"" of herbalism in this book. Clearly, there is great interest in the that history. Is it right for those readers to be mislead by a supposed ""expert"" whom they should be able to trust? This suggests to me that the author has no respect for his readers.When it comes to matters of health and healing, I cannot put any trust in an author who simply pulls their info out of their hiney.Would give this zero stars if I could.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HULOXYQHQMSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583943587#wasThisHelpful","R1HULOXYQHQMSA","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good: I give this 3 stars because there is useful information on specific herbs, some of which (cajeput, buchu, guaiacum) I haven't seen covered much elsewhere, and on ""chemical-identity"" groups such as tannins and alkaloids. Also gives ""person pictures"" for each herb detailing the symptom profiles, and where applicable, personality characteristics of the person who typically needs that herb.The bad: For almost every herb, the author insists that you don't dare administer it yourself, but see a trained herbalist--even for herbs that are generally regarded as pretty safe these days. I don't disagree that it would be ideal to be diagnosed by a pro, but for many people, the reason they are learning about herbs is precisely because there are no herbalists or naturopaths in their area. I kept wondering what, in the author's mind, was the point of writing a book like this, that allows a person to ""diagnose"" (within limits) their own and others' herbal ""person pictures"" if they are then admonished never to apply the information? (I suppose maybe she is just trying to cover herself, legally--I have no idea what sort of regulations there may be in Australia.)The book was written in 1988, and the author implies that she was not young then, so some outdated information is to be expected. But some of it strikes me as quite odd, especially her repeated statements that if people have chronic endocrine imbalances or skin conditions like excema or psoriasis it's because their ancestors had untreated venereal disease. There is a lengthy diatribe about how it's immoral to be promiscuous because you'll inevitably get VD and curse your descendants with disfiguring skin issues. She also talks about the necessity of douching with the implication that it is necessary for cleanliness, when we now know that is more likely to cause a microbial imbalance than leaving a healthy vagina to just do its business. There are many other points in the book where I can't really put my finger on why, but the author comes across as extremely condescending.In the end I get the sense that Hall does genuinely know her herbs well, but is inclined to be preachy and keep the bulk of her knowledge close to her chest.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D7SY92YK5O91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=087983496X#wasThisHelpful","R3D7SY92YK5O91","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read about the Halsa acupressure mat when I stumbled across someone's blog post on how they deal with free-floating anxiety (sorry, can't remember what blog it was). I have free-floating anxiety too, along with resulting insomnia, and can't afford to see an acupuncturist or masseur; I also have severe chronic mid/lower back pain and sciatica and reading reviews here I saw that many said the mat relieved their pain. I figured why not try it?When I first lie on the mat, it's not quite painful, but it's prickly. It is a portable bed of nails, basically, and those little points are SHARP. Some days my skin is more sensitive than others, don't know why. But within a couple minutes I start feel the circulation pumping in waves across my back. Shortly after that my back feels really, really hot--like when you're standing too close to a campfire--and the muscles start to relax just like they would in a hot bath. Actually I think it works better than a bath (unless you're comparing to one of those really deep, really hot Japanese baths, but I don't have one of those, alas).I've only been using the mat for about 2 weeks, so I'm looking forward to seeing the long term effects. I've used it every night before bed since I got it and haven't had trouble falling asleep, which is huge for me. As far as back pain goes, sometimes it really does relieve the pain (and nothing else does, so that's impressive). Other times it doesn't. I'm not sure what the difference is--maybe the length of time I'm lying on the mat? (I don't time it.) When I wake up in the morning my back still hurts like it always does, but combining the mat with a little bit of morning yoga I find my mood is so much better. I'm practically bright-eyed and bushy-tailed! I still have anxiety but it is so much reduced that I will not be going back to pharmaceuticals. (I also treat with herbs, for what it's worth.)

"Bought this book based on the positive reviews. I'm not really a fan, so I'm just going to lay out the pros and cons as I see them:PROS:-Much more ""how to"" than some psychic development books on the market-Has some useful advice on the practicalities and potential pitfalls of reading professionally that many authors don't bother to point out-Some of the methods are effective enough-The book assumes no prior knowledge or skill and doesn't use a lot of technical jargon-I felt like the author was sincerely expressing what she believes to be the best method-Has a glossary of terms commonly used in psychic and New Age parlance at the end-Focuses on clairvoyance only, which might be somewhat easier for an absolute newbie than other psychic methods (but then again some people get their info other ways, so I don't know)CONS:-The author uses only one particular method, which she indicates is popular at psychic training schools in the San Francisco BayArea, all of which were founded by one Lewis Bostwick or his students. In other words, it's great if you love that method, but if you don't, you won't find any alternatives here.-The method is weird compared to other methods I've learned--not saying it's completely uneffective necessarily but I do find it overly complicated (in particular the use of a ""viewing receptacle"") and certainly not more effective than other methods-It's as if the author has never heard of or tried any other way of psychic reading. She comes across as a little preachy or indoctrinated about it; personally I would have liked to see at least the acknowledgement that other perspectives and approaches exist. Most disturbing, when an author has to apologize for why the psychic training school they went to might *seem* like a cult, I get worried.-She implies that clairvoyant readings are somehow superior to other kinds of psychic reading, though she doesn't say it in so many words. She makes repeated references to ""pure clairvoyance"" and ""pure clairvoyant readings"" which doesn't match with my observations of how psychic phenomena work (no one I've ever met reads only in one way), and she emphasizes that the methods in this book are to help the reader develop clairvoyance only (with the implication that you would never want or need to develop another psychic skill set). She does specifically say that a reader shouldn't rely on their ""knowingness"" (her term for claircognizance) but should insist upon getting information only through clairvoyance. It seems bizarre to me to refuse information because it doesn't come in a predetermined form--in fact, discarding information because it doesn't fit your preconceived notions is a very bad idea.-Definitions in the glossary range from accurate (clairvoyance, clairsentience) to quite inaccurate (free-floating anxiety, karma)-You know how if you say a word over and over again it starts to sound silly and nonsensical? ""Energy"" is that word in this book.-Katz states several times that if you're seeing something, there's a reason for it--not so in my experience. Learning to discern between psychic and imaginary info is a huge part of psychic development. If you're a visually oriented person, your brain will throw all kinds of weird imagery at you. It may all glitter, but it's not all gold.Conclusion: I tried some of the methods in the book and found that for me, some worked ok and some didn't.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LKUUX2WHG1AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738705926#wasThisHelpful","R2LKUUX2WHG1AV","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This initially seemed like a great product, but there were problems with the size.Specifically--the size chart is based on your dog's girth. Now my dog's girth is about 20.5""--so, according to the chart here on Amazon, he should fit a size Small/Medium, which has a girth that expands from 20""-28"". There's a different chart on Premier's own website, but even according to that one, the Small/Medium is supposed to go from 19""-25"". (By the way these latter dimensions are more in line with what I observed.)And indeed, when the harness arrived, there was plenty of room for adjustment in the girth--but the chest strap was nowhere near wide enough for my dog, even at maximum extension. And he is just a 20lb terrier mix, not a particularly wide-chested dog like a pit bull or something that you would anticipate might need extra room in the chest.I ordered the next size up (medium) and it was WAY too big.Since no sizing information is available based on chest WIDTH (neither here on Amazon nor on the Premier site), nor does the description tell you the lengths of the different straps, it's impossible to know exactly which size your dog will need. If your dog has a wide chest, you will probably want to go with a different harness.

"The prose is beautiful, there's no doubt about that.  The overall structure of the story-within-a-story is intriguing.  But it just felt like this novel was trying too hard.  I'm not sure quite what it was trying to do though.  The main thing I found disappointing was the Enchantress herself.  The details we learn about her should make her interesting, but she is consistently underwritten.  While the male characters are three-dimensional, she just wafts in and out like scenery with legs.  Events revolve around her, yet never seem to engage her.  There are some other female characters who are very interesting, but we never hear that much about them.

On top of that it is a fascinating snapshot of 18th century English and Mughal cultures, the dynamics of interaction between them, and between men and women.  White Mughals is everything popular history should be--highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21R0EQM2RUC59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=014200412X#wasThisHelpful","R21R0EQM2RUC59","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to try this book on the basis of the story synopsis.  I wish I could give half stars because really I would probably give it 3.5 stars.  But I'm a fairly tough grader.  I found the writing to be good, not great literature, but not terrible (and I will give up on a book after one page if the writing is bad--yeah, I'm looking at you Stephenie Meyer).  I'd say the writing is arguably quite good for a novel aimed at young adults.Be warned, there are a lot of anachronisms here.  Some people aren't bothered by them, but they kind of jolt me out of the historical mood. For example, in a couple places the characters are described as wearing crinolines, but the book is set in 1895, 25 years after crinolines stopped being worn.  There are some references to class that that would have been deeply felt, but never articulated, by upper middle class women.  The school Headmistress scratches herself in public which would NEVER happen.  Probably the one that irritated me the most is that the characters were always unlacing their corsets to get out of them, which is not how corsets work.  (They unhook, people!  Easy peasy.  You don't need a helper to get into a corset.)I've read some of the more critical reviews of this book and it seems to me that a lot of them were expecting Dickens and were surprised that they got a young adult novel.  It's not literature, but it's not trying to be.  There are also a lot of criticisms that the girls don't think like Victorian girls, and I think that's true in some ways, but in other ways I think we are letting ourselves be ""sold"" on Victorian propaganda.  It makes us feel like we've come so far to imagine Victorian women as pathetically naive, but in doing so we underestimate women's intelligence.  The veneer of propriety in the late Victorian period didn't go very deep.  Yes, it's true that young girls were kept in the dark about sex as much as possible, BUT there were scads of erotic literature and ""French postcards"" and brothels in 1895.  Victorian men were getting up to some really nasty business, and while it's true that a lot of that was hidden from women, intelligent girls would have overheard things.  Their mothers would have attempted to subtly prepare them for their ""wifely duties.""  Another criticism was that the book focused on ""modern"" social issues like homosexuality, women's rights, interracial romance, etc.  This is true (except the homosexuality thing--a couple of characters are left ambiguous so that they could be read as having a homosexual relationship, or not, given the much more affectionate way that women treated each other in Victorian times), however these WERE issues in late Victorian times.  If anything, the book's failure is not in bringing those issues up, but in not detailing the conflict surrounding them.The main theme is young women's longing for freedom in a world which constrained them at every turn.  It's something that teenage girls should identify with.  You can truly feel how desperate, frustrated, and hopeless this made intelligent women feel.  I found it completely understandable that girls might be driven to horrifying and gruesome acts out of sheer desperation.  The girls' longing for independence and empowerment is very believable even if their lack of self-questioning about it maybe is not.  Mainly I was happy to see heroines facing a bigger threat than some boy not liking them, and who had ambitions bigger than marrying their jerk (vampire) boyfriend.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKH9QKWAJR6TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385732317#wasThisHelpful","RKH9QKWAJR6TO","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this lamp to replace a totally different one I used as a bathroom nightlight.  I searched around the internets and this was the only lamp that was (a) the right size and (b) not ridiculously expensive.  However, it's a lot different from the picture--first, the body of the lamp is not glossy, it's matte; second, the shade does not cover the socket that you screw the bulb into.  Which is to say, the bottom of the shade doesn't come down to the top of the base, there's a ""neck"" in between.  To me, this really diminishes the lamp's aesthetic appeal.  Finally, the finish of the base was chipped in two places, so that there's almost no way I can position it that the chips don't show, and there was a pulled thread on the shade.  The glue used on the seam of the lampshade left a slight stain on the fabric.That said, I still gave it two stars because it is inexpensive.

"This is one of the best books I have read to date. I'm not Korean/KA, and I've never been to New York, so I have no idea how well the characters represent either of these facets of America, and don't much care. I read this book and tried to appreciate its narrator and setting as unique rather than metaphorical or archetypal. I found the prose to be exceptionally incisive and elegant in places; in fact sometimes the narrative was so intense for me that it was exhausting. The narrator felt very realistic in that no matter how introspective he became, part of him always seemed to remain a mystery to himself, and Lee does not condescend to the reader or brutalize the prose by spelling it all out. The only other author I've read who can write characters that are both unusually self-analytical and blithely (and realistically) un-self-aware is Haruki Murakami (though the style of the writing is totally different).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15A5NYEZSEOOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1573225312#wasThisHelpful","R15A5NYEZSEOOG","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 1950 version of ""King Solomon's Mines"" deserves a full 5 stars if only for one reason--it is one of the few movies even to this day which is set in Africa, filmed in Africa, and features actual Africans portraying Africans.  In particular, the dance scene near the end almost has the quality of an ethnographic film, and is worth watching in itself because the lead dancer is one of the finest you will ever see.While it is true that this movie is barely the same story as the H. Rider Haggard novel, that can only be a good thing, as the book is racist and unbelievably sexist even by 19th century standards.  The plot is indeed full of adventure, but there were several points where the descriptions of game hunting (without even taking the trophies!  for literally no reason!) made me nauseous.  By all means, read it and get a taste of 19th century British attitudes toward their colonies.  It ain't pretty, by today's standards.Whether you love or hate the plot of the movie, this film is, in its way, a little piece of history.  It's true the African actors aren't the main stars of the movie (though some of them are so charismatic they steal their scenes).  But lest we forget, in 1932, only 18 years before, Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young, and Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy all played Chinese people (in ""The Hatchet Man"" and ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" respectively) because God forbid Hollywood would actually cast Chinese actors.  It would be a long time before an African or African-American actor would be considered a big enough star to draw mainly white audiences, but ""KSM"" was a step in the right direction and it's a lot more engrossing movie because of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TKAKQHQM5UHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006B2A7E#wasThisHelpful","R1TKAKQHQM5UHI","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once my best friend described my bra size as ""beige.""  Meaning that when you shop in the ""full figure"" section of a department store, you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny's closet. Most of the bras are beige, with some black or white ones, and all are gigantic and ugly.If this sounds familiar to you, then this is the bra for you.  It looks pretty, comes in a variety of colors, and I at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences.  The cups do the supporting, so the bra doesn't need to have those super-wide, heavily padded straps.  And it gives a good silhouette under clothes, but will also look nice by itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/RETM3U0PU55RS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008ECSB#wasThisHelpful","RETM3U0PU55RS","A5SD8VUB6YKWC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5SD8VUB6YKWC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogWell, we are coming to an end.  Finally!  And I finally see the way things will start blowing up in peoples faces.  Although, I foresee a cliffhanger ending to this season.  Not happy about that.WEATHER THE STORM felt a bit like a preparation for the end type of installment.  What I liked about it is that it lacked the over the top drama that the rest of the characters experience in Storm.  This story centers around Bryce, the Pastor, and his wife Tara.  They are dealing with their youngest song being diagnosed with autism and how that is taking a toll on their marriage.  I was really happy that the author didnt work in extra stuff. And to see somewhat of a happy resolution to their issues.  The first in this series history!Then theres Dakota.  I really dislike her character and she seems to be the one that will bring hell on Ginny Morenos parade.

"Reviewed by Angela and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogOnce Kissed is the first installment from The Obrien Family and a spin-off from Shattered Past series. While Shattered Past focused on the Santos siblings, Obrien Family will focus on, well, the Obrien siblings.First up is Curran who is a Philly cop assigned on light duty due to a recent incident that resulted with his partner getting seriously hurt. This assignment is suppose to get him back on track. Hes not happy about it but it has its perks. The lady hell be protecting is no other than his one-night-stand from college, Tess Newart. He and Tess has changed quite a bit since the. but its obvious that the attraction remains the same. Unfortunately, its not that simple. They both have demons that can prevent them from getting their happy-ending. Curran suffers from PTSD and Tess, an abusive father, not to mention the danger she is in by working with the District Attorney and simply, the pressures of life.I loved the opposite-attract vibe in their relationship. Curran is funny, flirty, and sexy while Tes sported a librarian look, very serious and very closed off. Despite the difference the pairing worked and not a sight of instalove in their relationship. Kudos to Cecy Robson, the romance was well done!The Obrien siblings together was a sight to be held. They were hilarious with their banters and teased each other to the brink of annoyance and embarrassment but in the end, the love and loyalty between them is strong and palpable. These siblings truly captured my heart. They are all down to earth, not just with their personalities, but the lives they live. There were are no gazilionaires with a tortured past in sight but honest to goodness regular peopledown to earth.Currans brother Killian already had his book and there are a total of seven siblings. Im excited to read all their stories. Im not quite sure whos up next but whether its Angus, Seamus, Declan, Finnie, or Wren, Im confident that Ms. Robson will not disappoint. She hasnt yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16RGBIF9VHERG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI48WW#wasThisHelpful","R16RGBIF9VHERG","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogTHE JAPANESE LOVER is a beautiful life story about two women.  One at the end of her complicated life, and one at a crossroads in the middle where she has to overcome her past.  Alma Belasco, originally from Polland, came to live with her aunt and uncle in the US when she was a little girl.  They gave her a lavish life catering to her every whim, raising her in a society where she never has to want for anything.  During her childhood, she becomes best friends with a Japanese boy.  Although life tears them apart, that friendship marks her life and throughout the years, as their relationship changes, becomes the biggest part of who she is.  Friendship turns into love, turns into loss and pain.We meet Alma when shes an old woman living in a retirement home.  Her only companions?  Her grandson Seth and one of the caretakers at the home, Irina.  The second woman we get to meet in this book and whose life becomes forever changed by this story.  Shes young and down on her luck, having a past that tortures her every day.  But its Alma and her story, and eventually Seth and his love, that make a big difference for Irina.This is a beautifully heartbreaking story about life, love and mistakes.  Love had, love lost.  Love that can withstand the test of time.  Love that can help heal.  But also centers around prejudice and how it can break someone and get in the way of happiness.  Although this story is a bit understated, and it starts off slower than I wouldve liked, by the time it gets going you cant help but get lost in these characters and want to know more.  I felt like a little kid waiting for grandma to tell the story of her life.  Her adventures.  The format in which its told going back and forth between past and present, was perfect to show the reader how they got here.  And the ending is bittersweet.  This is definitely a book that surprised me by making me shed a tear on more than one occasion because the writing was so subdued, the emotions snuck up on me.As much as I enjoyed this book a lot, I have to admit I couldnt help but compare it to her other work and see it fall short of my expectations.  Isabel Allende is legendary in her writing and I cant quite see this as being up there with her classics.  However, if you go into it with a clear mind or if this is your first foray into her writing, I believe you wont be disappointed with this story full of depth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJNTFBQJ7G0AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URY5CE8#wasThisHelpful","RJNTFBQJ7G0AJ","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 StarsReviewed by Suzanne and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogThe last time we saw Cassie the Demon Council had thrown Pritkins soul back through time and its ultimate destruction and discovered a plot for the former Pythias acolytes to bring back the old gods. Neither of which is great news, destroying Apollo nearly killed Cassie, so trying to stop his bigger meaner brother Ares may prove impossible, especially with all the supernatural faction fighting against each other, and her, rather than focusing on the real problem. And Pritkin. She cant let his soul disappear, especially when she can stop it, after all travelling through time is her speciality.At last! I have been waiting for this book for forever, and we were kept waiting an extra year, but was the 2 year gap between books worth it? We were left with a massive cliff hanger in the previous book, Tempt the Stars, with Pritkin seeming to be all but dead and Cassie about to embark on a desperate mission to save him. A mission which has a limited chance of success and accompanied by Rosier, Pritkins dead beat dad, Demon Lord and all round douche bag. So, as I said, was it worth the wait? Yes, yes it was.You need to be prepared when starting a Cassie Palmer novel because you are about to dive head first in to some unrelenting crazy action, from the first page to the last Cassie and co jump from a disaster to a catastrophe and then back to another disaster, all with barely a pause for breath. And I loved every second of it, this series is always exciting and really gets your adrenaline pumping.But, all that action could become boring, but it doesnt, mainly because we have Cassie. She is a great heroine, she injects humour, intelligence and a good amount of heart in this series and she is what keeps me coming back for more. Well, her and the strange love triangle between her, Mircea the smooth and sexy Master Vampire and Pritkin the grouchy and gorgeous War Mage and half Incubus. FYI Im team Pritkin all the way.Once again however, we are left with a cliff hanger, it seems unfair the Karen Chance can draw me in and then leave me hanging like this! I just really hope I dont have to wait 2 years before I find out what happens next. But, despite my grumblings I highly recommend this series, it has an intriguing plot line, a fantastic heroine and plenty of action and romance to keep you entertained, so if you havent started this series yet, what are you waiting for?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5WAKQ7R4VEZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGI91YS#wasThisHelpful","R5WAKQ7R4VEZ6","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 StarsReviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogIn the third installment to the Desert Dogs series, Cara McKenna finally gives Casey Grossier his book. From the very first book, Casey has been my favorite of the boys. He has that bad boy thing going for him, but now that he also a bar to run, hes really come far from his wayward ways.This becomes especially true when a woman and a child come into his life. Though neither of them belong to him, Casey is more than willing to take care of Abilene Price and Mercy from the threat of her ex, a newly released criminal deadset on taking back what is his.What I liked about this book is that it has a very laid back feeling to it, but McKenna does amp it up every now and then with the suspense scenes. I particularly liked seeing some of James POV because it just adds that bit of tension to the storyline. It makes this entire series different from the other biker books out there as it toes the line between Contemporary Romance and Romantic Suspense.As always, McKennas writing draws you in like a beacon. Im such a fan of her voice and just her ability to get inside her characters head makes each book such a thrill to read.

"Reviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogGrieving over her friends unexpected murder, Lexi is determined to find her killer. However, the Dark have lured her into their embraces and when Thorn spots the curious woman, he knows that she is in immediate danger. Unfortunately, Lexi trusts no one. Not even the handsome warrior who seems to know more about whats going than she does.Ive been a fan of this series for some time now. However, the beginning of this book felt a little choppy to me. It begins after Lexis friends die and her other friends are leaving to return home. Lexi opts to stay and find the killer on her own. Because of this initial set up, I did feel one step behind it all. I cant remember in the previous book of something happened there to set up this one but I definitely felt one foot behind Lexi in this one.Moreover, when Thorn appears, trying to save her life from the Dark, in one glance he is able to tell that she has retribution on her mind. Why else would a woman risk her life like that? Again, this seemed like a great jump in logic, especially when theyve barely said any words to each other. And what ones they have, they werent friendly to begin with. So I was a little concerned with the way Grant skimmed over these details. She is usually very patient and thorough but I feel like the natural flow to her words this time was missing.While not my favorite in the series, there is still plenty of action and progress in terms of plot. Some exciting things occur and I am looking forward to see what Grant delivers next.spacer","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BA0MDEY05QZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDZS944#wasThisHelpful","R2BA0MDEY05QZY","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogOut of all the cute novellas in this series, THE BILLIONAIRE SINGLE DAD was the one I was most excited about. I just adore single dad heroes and knew that Carter Christensen was going to be great.Taking care of two rowdy girls had been difficult for Carter ever since his wife died of cancer. Its been two years and in that time, Carter feels as if he has been regressing instead of making some progress in his life. His children are unhappy about his constant grumpiness and when they say they want to run away, their neighbor Tess Adams comes in and convinces them to stay.I quite liked the romance in this one because both characters were very interesting. Since its a novellas, everything happens very fast, which means that Carter gets over his grief in what feels like a blink. For the sake of word count, I could understand why it needed to happen that quickly to make some progress in terms of the romance but it also made it a little unbelievable given how hung up Carter was before meeting Tess.I will say though that there is cuteness in spades in this book and thats mainly due to the two little girls. They definitely added more to this story and as a result, I think this is my favorite in the series so far.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25YJRXWZJQ5O0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122RZN82#wasThisHelpful","R25YJRXWZJQ5O0","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogONE KINGS WAY is one of those instances where you need to know when to stop. After the last book in the series, that was supposed to be the end of the series. However, Samantha Young has released this novella featuring Craig, a character that weve been before. If Im going to be totally honest with you, I didnt like this novella. At all.Craig is portrayed as the flirt. As a bartender, he gets a lot of attention with the ladies. However, I found that Craigs attempt at flirting seemed to be shut down by the heroine every single time. So readers dont get that fun, flirty nature that were expecting from Craig.The real problem in this story is the heroine, Rain. Rain Alexander has a major chip on her shoulder. She has a lot of anger pent up and she wants to channel that into gaining revenge. This entire plot seemed petty and stupid, putting Rain in a very unfavorable light. So much so that I wondered countless times what Craig found appealing about her character. Shes so emotionally manipulative that I lost interest very quickly. Young doesnt really do anything to redeem her either.I found that the resolution was swift and not very believable, pushing things to the side rather than really dealing with the problem. I was expecting much more for Craig but ended up being quite disappointed in his happily ever after. I think its safe to say that Ill be skipping on this authors next releases.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OB5Z7TEBBZNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOAZYYY#wasThisHelpful","R2OB5Z7TEBBZNI","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These Highland dragons live in the same world as Dragonfury, obviously from Scotland and of course with a Scottish brogue. From what I know, each dragon will have his HEA. Much like the other dragon packs, these dragons are fierce, sexy and has been waiting a long time to finally meet their soul mates.If youve met Forge from the Night Fury pack, Tydrin is his cousin and is first from this pack to get his HEA. Tydrin and Ivy were a perfect pair in a way that they equally needed and relied on each other. Thier love story was sweet but came too fast for my liking. I have a feeling well see more of them as this new series unfold.Ms. Callahan gave us a taste of each dragons personality. They have the humor, camaraderie and a dangerous, sexy vibe to them. Theres definitely more going on in the business aspect of this world. One of their own is missing, and Im curious to his whereabouts. It feels like something big is brewing.

"Reviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogIm a big Mary Calmes fan so its a little surprising that I havent venture into her Paranormal Romances as much. So in an effort to rectify that, I wanted to try this audiobook and delve into the world that many seem to love.FORGING THE FUTURE is actually the fifth book in the series and well, stupid me, I thought that I could jump in and be totally okay with it. I dont know whether it was the fact that I listened to this as an audiobook and the narrators voice kind of irritated me or maybe it was because Calmes has many terms in this series that Im familiar with, but I found it very easy to get lost.Its clear that Calmes has put a lot of effort into the worldbuilding. Theres many alluring aspects that set this book apart from the other paranormal romances out there. I especially loved the dynamic that Jin and Logan had. So while I felt one step behind in terms of the world, the romance was still fantastic and well done.Another factor that I think influenced how much I enjoyed this book was the narrator. There are some accents involved and I hate to say this, but a few of them were really bad. I have no doubt that if I read this book instead of listening to it, I would have enjoyed it far more.That being said, I will recommend this series in order. The romance is wonderful written and with such a unique world as this is, Ill make sure to return to it soon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20T87EPJUU66Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0103PENZY#wasThisHelpful","R20T87EPJUU66Y","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 StarsReviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogMust be something about those sisters!  Or maybe its the fact that Ethan Dexter is just sex on legs.  I mean the man is a walking contradiction what with the sexy lumbersexual look, the man bun, the carefully trimmed beard, then add to that all the tats and piercings and the fact he is artsy and designed all those tats, not just a jock.  Be still my beating heart!  And.hes a virgin.  Gah!  I die.Hes that guy you can depend on and count on to be a rock and the strength of a group.  Now out of college and playing professionally for the NFL for a while, hes more grounded in his life and he also thinks that the woman he had set his sights on a few years back might just be ready to notice him.  And thats always been Fiona, Ivys little sister.Ive already waxed poetic about why Dex is more than amazing and totally book boyfriend material but lets not forget about Fi.  Shes a take charge kind of girl, not intimidated by many things and certainly she doesnt shy away from her wants and feelings for Dex when it wouldve been easily something another author couldve used as drama.  Their romance is straight forward, sweet, explosively hot (did I mention the piercings?).  What Dex lacks in experience he makes up in single minded focus to make his woman happy.  In and out of the bedroom.  Refer to ultimate book boyfriend material part.Although maybe I found some of the big blow out reactions on both Fiona and Dexs part a bit unrealistic and over the top, that was my only sort of complain about the whole story.  So thats almost perfect!  And THIS is my favorite book in the series.  Not sure how you can top Ethan Dexter in my book!  Now I think Im positively ready for the m/m story with Londo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L6J9EF6OQHA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TW5PV6#wasThisHelpful","R1L6J9EF6OQHA7","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Suzanne and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogFaith Graham is dreading her sisters wedding, any family event usually involves her perfect waif-like sisters and mother criticising her curvy body, and the wedding bound to be hellish. Which, is why her crazy friends think it would be the perfect idea to hire a male escort to pose as her boyfriend for the wedding. Joe Starling is Perfect Tens best escort, charming and gorgeous, and wickedly talented in the bedroom (or car, or wall) he is sought out and he loves his job. However, when he first sets eyes on cute, curvy and shy Faith, he knows his life was going to change, he just doesnt know how much.I am sure by reading the blurb of Perfect Ten you think you know exactly what is going to happen with this book. And you would be completely correct, this book travels the well-worn path of the male escort books that came before it. But, although not particularly original, that didnt stop me from enjoying Perfect Ten, how can I not when the hero has such a deliciously dirty mouth?Ah Joe, theres a man who enjoys his work, that is, until Faith comes along and shows him there is more to life and definitely more to women then just meaningless sex. Not that she means to, after a lifetime of verbal abuse about her body Faiths self esteem is pretty low and I loved that Joe loved and lusted after her just as she was. Their was no miraculous weight loss or sudden change in her appearance, their was just Faith and Joe and the undeniable heat between them.The sex and sexual tension between Faith and Joe was one of my favourite things about this book, Craig writes this really well, and I loved that Joe was a dirty talker. The romance was good as well, Joe bolstered Faiths body image and Faith showed Joe that he was capable of more and together they made a great couple.I enjoyed this book and would definitely read more from Michelle Craig.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q38T7VFEM776/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2FRN5U#wasThisHelpful","R2Q38T7VFEM776","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogCalder is flying back home to see his family for the holidays when he happens to run into a girl he may have bullied a bit in school.  Hes grown up and matured since then and he feels sorry for his actions then, but he also sees this new beautiful woman she has become and he cant stay away until he gets a bite.With just a tad less focus on hockey as the first book, ACROSS THE LINE has a lot of small town charm.  A boyishly sweet hero with a loving family, and a woman who is used to living life on her own and getting things done by herself because thats how she had to grow up.  Their opposites definitely made a perfect blend and I for one gobbled up this story in almost one go.  And it combines two things I love to read about in contemporary romance: hockey and food!Becca is a successful restaurant owner back home and shes not used to having a man in her life.  Definitely not used to depending on anyone since her family has never thought her decision of opening a restaurant was good enough.  The pressure, the expectations, the lack of support and encouragement, have all made her a bit closed off to others.  Including men.  Calder has to slowly break through those walls to get in.Of course, lets talk about the hero.  Calder is the type of man you wish could be there for you.  Hes sweet, hes sexy, hes playful, but hes also that responsible rock to lean on when you need it, that strength pushing you to do better because he knows you can.  And he can beat people up with his stick   So yeah, he gets all the points!If you like sweet and sexy contemporary romance, then definitely look at this series.  Its got a bit of everything and it feels fresh and fun.  It was really enjoyable to read and I cant wait to explore more of the men from this team, especially the playboy Alex!spacer","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TKUVRTO76M9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPJNKTE#wasThisHelpful","R3TKUVRTO76M9H","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 StarsReviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogIm starting to think I have a single minded interest in this series.  There are many people I dont care enough to read about but when it comes to Luis Moreno and Mallory Alvarez, Im all over that hot mess!I really enjoyed how TAKE THE STORM goes back a bit more on how it gives you bits and pieces of a lot of different town peoples lives instead of completely focusing on one couple and their troubles.  As much as we get to see Luis in the aftermath of the Lacey debacle and wanting Mallory back with a passion (but not doing anything about it), we also see a glimpse of Dakota, Ginny, and more recently Marisol and Patrick.I cant say I didnt see Marisols decision at the end coming, but I was hoping for a bit more between them.  There is always next season right?  Because the way things are going I only foresee that getting worst before it can get better.I really want to see something from Dillon and Joanne, they have been sort of background noise for most of the series when they were such a big part at the beginning.  My only concern now as the end of the first Season approaches is how much will get resolved before the next batch of stories is released.  This is such a big plot and as of yet, we have not seen answers.  Just more and more tangles.  I just dont know that Ill have the commitment to stick to a whole other season before getting those answers and seeing things blow up in peoples faces.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KUW071TAXE8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XJ05RQ#wasThisHelpful","R3KUW071TAXE8S","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Suzanne and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogLady Tabitha Shelton made a pact with her two cousins; that they would become old maids together, they wouldnt let societys expectation that they should all marry trap them. Not that Tabitha is inundated with offers, no matter that her dowry is embarrassingly large, she is far to plain and plump for that, and has been a wallflower since her debut. That is, until Noah, Marquess of Devonport one of her brothers best friends and of the few men she is comfortable enough to have a conversation with, suddenly starts flirting with her. At least she thinks hes flirting. But is Noah like all the other men who has tried to pursue her; a fortune hunter or does he want Tabitha for herself?I wanted a romance where the Wallflower was unexpectedly swept off her feet by the handsome and charming, or maybe dark and brooding, hero to shock and awe of all the ton. A Cinderellaesque type of story that I could happily float along with and enjoy. Wallflower kind of reached these expectations, the heroine was definitely a wallflower and hero was handsome, however, the only sweeping being done was by the servants.Maybe I am too used to the heroes being commanding and alpha, so when a beta hero like Noah comes a long, I feel a little underwhelmed. However, I refuse to believe that a beta hero has to be bland, which unfortunately is how I felt about Noah. However, I did like Tabitha and Noah together, they had a very sweet, although at times sedate romance. I looked forward to the times when passion would flare between them as thats when they seemed to have the most chemistry.I did like this book, it was an enjoyable read and I am intrigued enough about the cast of supporting characters in Wallflower to want to read the next in this series. But, I just wish the romance between Noah and Tabitha was a little bit more exciting.spacer","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U78T7GODWKW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZR9F7S#wasThisHelpful","R1U78T7GODWKW1","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Suzanne and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogMillie Cross knew, even though she was young, that  Logan High Judd was the one, she would do anything for him, even walk away from him, if it would make him happy. However, even now years later High doesnt know why Millie left him, leaving him devastated and when she appears back in his life he is determined not to let her hurt him again, he would have walked through fire for Millie, what he doesnt know, is that she already has.Im a big Kristen Ashley fan, there are very few books that she has written that I havent fan-girled all over, its disgusting really, the drooling, the book stroking, the victory dancingI should really stop doing that in public places. She draws me in with her sexy alpha male heroes and her sassy heroines until its impossible to escape, and quite frankly why would I try?However, I am not blind to the flaws in Ashleys books, the way her characters are all very similar, her tendency to be over descriptive and lets now forget how much she detests personal pronouns. But, that magic mixture of supposed flaws seems to do it for me, I dont know what I would do if suddenly Kristen Ashley started to write beta heroes. Having said that, I struggled a bit with the premise of this book. I thought the reason Millie split up with High was ridiculous and all those years of misery for both of them could have been sorted out with a single conversation. Books based on miscommunication (or in this case no communication) tend to wind me up.If I ignore that though, I did enjoy the relationship between High and Millie, together they were sexy and sweet together. I just didnt like the needless emotional drama, as no matter how much I was into it, I was too exasperated by the cause of it to be appreciative. But, it wasnt just the relationship between High and Millie, I liked seeing the previous characters play their parts in Walk Through Fire and then there was Millie trying to build a relationship with Highs kids.Another good book by Kristen Ashley, and although this isnt my favourite I did enjoy and as always will be waiting eagerly for her next release.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P3XB98ZC82IS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76II#wasThisHelpful","R3P3XB98ZC82IS","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Guest Reviewed by Jennifer and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogThe Stripped series by Skye Warren takes me back to my favorite genre of them all, dark erotic romance.  Pretty When You Cry is book 3 in the series that also includes two novellas.  Being order obsessed and being a newbie to Skye Warrens work meant that before reading Pretty When You Cry, I tackled all prior installments.in one week.  Its been a long time since Ive been that intent on devouring an established series that had a fair amount work already published.  The Stripped series all center around The Grand, a strip club run by the mysterious Ivan.  Theres nothing wholesome about this world.  Its seedy and each girl has a past, a reason why theyve come to call The Grand their home.  Pretty When You Cry is the story of owner Ivan and Candace (Candy), a woman that showed up on his doorstep as a scared 16 year old runaway. Candace grew up in a religious compound, believing she was the epitome of sin and temptation.  When she lands at Ivans feet, nave and confused, he shelters her from his world.  Years later, a grown woman, Candy works as a stripper, allowing herself to fall into a pattern of excess: too much partying to cover up the pain.  Ivan is still there, her replacement father figure, dolling out punishment as he sees fit.  Nothing is really what it seems, and when a series of threats from Candys past surface, Ivan and his security team mobilize to protect one of their own.  Candy only kneels for one man and Ivan can no longer resist the temptation to claim what has always been his.  But Candy needs more than what Ivan is willing to give.Wow, just wow.  I LOVED all the prior installments in this series and Pretty When You Cry is no exception.  You can read it as a standalone, but I wouldnt.  The others are too good to miss and knowing these characters at the onset, what they mean to other people, their established reputations, makes it all the more enjoyable.  Ms. Warrens writing is tight and perfectly paced.  These books are all moderate in length and say what they need to without excess.  They are atmospheric, gritty, and the emotions are intense, but realistic.  Its an understatement to say that these characters are damaged.  Both Ivan and Candace come from unspeakable pasts, involving childhood abuse.  Ivan has risen to financial success, but hes far from pristine.  Theres an undercurrent that all his dealings might not be squeaky clean.  He has pure emotion, but hes not always the good guy and this is my favorite type of character.  Hes beautiful and fierce.  Candace is damaged but determined, knowing what she wants, but also what she needs to grow as a person.  She is a brave, and doesnt always choose what I would have wanted for her, but it works out in the end.  The sexual relationship between Ivan and Candace deserves discussion, and its the focus of a lot of reviews of Pretty When You Cry.  The Stripped series in general dips into the taboo when it comes to sex.  I would not have classified the previous books as classic BDSM erotic romance, as there are no safe words, no tools of the trade.  But anyone familiar with D/s themes will know right away that each book portrays characters that fall into Dominant and submissive roles, each with kinks that they call their own, from a need to be humiliated and degraded to just plain dirty and rough sex.  Pretty When You Cry actually portrays a fairly well known D/s  construct of Daddy Dom/little.  If youve never read this or heard of it, I would keep an open mind, to understand that those who fall into this type of kink arent trying to create some type of pedophilic scenario, nor are they necessarily damaged and in need of therapy.  Its a kink like any other that fulfills some type of psychological need.  Candy calls Ivan Daddy, and their sexual relationship revolves around punishment/reward, with innocent/experienced roles.  He is the protector and provider.  If its a trigger for you, Id skip this one. For me, the sex was mind-blowingly hot and unique, with pain and the taboo wrapped up in it all.  Theres a hint of consensual  non-consensuality that gives it a dark and delicious edge.  There is a fitting and satisfying HEA that warmed my heart.  I am now going to read Skye Warrens entire backlist because I had no idea what I was missing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E6465FUN1AHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016SFKK0U#wasThisHelpful","R2E6465FUN1AHY","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogFor what feels like years ago now, the I-Team series was my top favorite Romantic Suspense series for a long time. I remembered readers begging Pamela Clare for horny Hollys book for years but the time has come to have her story told. When I realized that SEDUCTION GAME was Hollys book my expectations sky-rocketed and I went into this book hoping to be blown away. And I was.For the most part.Pamela Clares action sequences are money. From the very first page, the action and suspense pulls this book forward. It reminded me a lot of what I loved about the earlier books. Scene after scene grips you and its impossible to put the book down.However, as I mentioned, I think I was more critical about this book more because its one of my favorites and I really wanted Hollys book to shine. That being said, Nick Andris turned out to the perfect hero for her. Although Nick is a bit cold in the beginning as he is driven by his dark need for revenge, his hang-ups are pushed aside as the true romance begins. I would have loved to get more out of Nicks character since the story starts out with him being very wary of everyone. I didnt feel like we knew him well before the action started. And then there was no time after.One thing I loved about Clares writing was the attention to detail. In all honestly, I felt like some of that was missing from this book. Some scenes were highly detailed and others seemed to gloss over things that I would have loved to explore some more. As a result, I didnt think it was all very consistent. I also do wonder if thats just because I wanted more from this book and wanted to like it a lot.So despite those minor things, SEDUCTION GAME is still a wonderful installment to the series. While it doesnt match the first few books that I hold above all others, it is one of my favorite stories that Clare has put out recently.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNELDMCKHIRGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KUWWAM#wasThisHelpful","RNELDMCKHIRGJ","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Suzanne and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogDo you even need a synopsis? This is a Lisa Kleypas book after all and even more than that, it is a HISTORICAL Lisa Kleypas book, something we have all been waiting for since she foolishly decided to dally in contemporary romance (although, I kind of loved those for the most part as well, the woman has skillZ with a capital Z). I admit, I didnt waste time reading the blurb, I was too busy opening the first page and getting my read on.This had the potential to seriously disappoint me, as you can tell, my expectations of Lisa Kleypas are sky high, and I really didnt want to topple to hard ground of reality by finding this book less than what I expected. However, I should have known better than to doubt, to sum up in three small words: I loved it.Cold Hearted Rake introduces us to the Ravenael family, famous for their hot passions and even hotter temper, in particular the last two men left in the family Devon and West. Devon has unexpectedly inherited the Earldom after the death of his cousin, a burden that he doesnt want, especially when it comes with three younger girl cousins and Kathleen, his cousins widow. And he especially doesnt want to feel this helpless fascination with Kathleen who manages to drive him mad as she ignites his lust and other feelings he doesnt want to think about.As always Kleypas has delivered a romance that was intense, full of emotions and sexual chemistry as Kathleen and Devon alternatively battle each other and fall in love. She masterfully builds up the relationship between them with a bit of sexual tension, arguments and a few tender and vulnerable moments thrown in as well. But, it wasnt just the main couple that I loved seeing, we were introduced to the quiet, shy Helen, the rambunctious twins Pandora and Cassandra and Devons younger brother the dissipated West as well.Skillfully written, and imbued with humour, romance and emotion Lisa Kleypas has once again proven why she is the best in the historical romance genre. I am now impatiently waiting for the next  book in the series, which I have feeling I will love even more than this one, is it possible to give a book 6 stars?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R195CXU8KK7M42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLULO7K#wasThisHelpful","R195CXU8KK7M42","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogWe know her as Mistress Nora but THE QUEEN gives readers the in depth version of how they got there. While the White Years is technically what happens before the first set of books, I always tell readers to read this at the end because there are so many different layers to these characters, its almost easier to meet Nora first and then get to know her as Elle after.Whats great about this series is that Reisz has a lot of material to work from. I dont know if she already had these backstories in her mind when she started writing the first books, but these dont just feel like added layers to an already solid series; they dig deeper, cutting into the heart of the matter of these characters. If you thought you knew them before, you get to know them more in these books.THE QUEEN essentially picks up where Elle returns from the convent and this is when King gives her a job of a lifetime. He will train her and make her in the most powerful, most influential Mistress that anyone has ever come across. Problem is, Elle is a submissive and doesnt know if she is capable of topping like King wants her to. Theres the added competition in Milady who has quickly risen to the top in the underworld and Elle must now outman her.A lot of my favorite characters make an appearance. Of course this was expected though because I dont think a series like this would work unless we had everyone together in one way or the other. Whats interesting about this series is that while theres a lot of sharing in these novels, each scene has its intimate moments. And I think thats what makes these books so compelling. Its not just sex scene after sex scene. And Reiszs writing helps with that too. Eloquent and free-flowing, these books are honestly some of the best written ones Ive come across in a long time. Talent, along with Reiszs fearlessness to write about anything, is what makes these books so edgy and different. They are definitely worth your while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJUWHFEB3J7QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URKUITG#wasThisHelpful","RJUWHFEB3J7QC","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogGet ready for some crazy because G.A. Aiken is back with another installment to the Dragon Kin series. This is one of my favorite series just because of how fun it is. These dragons dont follow any rules and arent regulated by human standards so they are a loony bunch for sure. Paired with Aikens epic worldbuilding and politics and youve got a fun story with a little bit of sexiness thrown in as well.Glheanna is no stranger to the mayhem that occurs in this book. As she goes around threatening everyone around her and headbutting those who annoy her, you know that this book will undoubtedly be a funny read. When Glheanna has been tasked with escorting the highborn Bram the Merciful, she is a little miffed about it all but she cannot deny that she is a tiny bit attracted to him.I loved this short story. Not only does it capture the light and fun tone of the rest of the series, but Aiken still manages to give her readers something special to look forward to as she takes us down underwater to see the Fins, another breed of dragons that live in the sea. I really loved this touch and thought it added such a great layer to the series.While I was reading, I was going to say that the only complaint I had was that there isnt much romance until the end. Theres a lot of build-up but it isnt until 65% that Aiken gives in and gives readers what they want. And while at first I was getting a little frustrated, I found that by the end, I was completely satisfied with how she handled the romance. For a novella, its very well done and makes me wish she wrote more of these shorter stories between the long waits of the full length books.If you havent read this series and are a fan of Kresley Coles Immortals After Dark, give this one a shot! Youll fall in love with these crazy dragons!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E89F0IXASDVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE6PH9K#wasThisHelpful","R3E89F0IXASDVG","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 StarsReviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogI think I fell for Brendon in UNCONDITIONAL when he didnt get the girl.  Dont discount him as just a meat-head who is just into keeping his body in the best shape.  When we met him first he had just gotten over the heartbreak of losing THE ONE.  Although he thought he was in love with Maci, all it took was one text message from Amanda to turn his world upside down.UNFORGETTABLE is the story about Brendon and Amandas second chance.  Because they never truly got over each other and their love is still burning strong.  I really liked that the author gave them that break, especially for Brendon to become who he is today and stand on his own two feet.  His personality can be too self sacrificing and he may have put things about his own dreams on hold had he been in a relationship.Brendon travels from Australia to the US on Amandas text request that she needs him.  Lets just say I sort of suspected part of what was coming, not going to give you any spoilers here.  But twist after the reveal was a hard one to swallow.  It tore me apart and its not until the very end that we get a resolution on it.  Yeah, some tears mightve leaked out.As with the previous book in this series, the story is deeply emotional and I loved that about it.  I just didnt connect with Amanda as much as I wanted to, or as much as I did with Maci, in order for this book to achieve what the first one did for me.  I didnt understand her reasons for certain decisions she made so I couldnt sympathize sometimes.Overall, this was a great addition to the series full of heart and angst with great writing!  I will be looking forward to the next story coming out which is about Amandas sister.  You will fall for this little spitfire with her own demons to battle.  I cant wait!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39FXFG3ODLFSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UH3FI20#wasThisHelpful","R39FXFG3ODLFSI","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 StarsReviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogIn the third installment to the U.S. Marshals series, Mandy Baxter takes a hottie in Parker Evans and sweetheart in Tabitha Martins and puts them together in this sweet but also suspenseful novel.Parker feels like he has been undercover for a long time. However, his latest job involves a hotel manager that seems to push all his hot buttons. When Parker learns of Tabithas involvement in her exs drug operation, he knows he wants to shut it down and get Tabitha out of harms way, to prevent him from using her and risking her life again.Though this book does have a heavy emphasis on the U.S. Marshals assignment that Parker has, theres this softer tone that carries throughout this novel and I think thats mainly due to Tabithas presence. She brings the sweeter side out of him and thats a big feat because in the beginning Parker seems a bit cold and jaded.For readers interested in this series, I would say that this leans a little bit more on the Contemporary Romance side rather than full on Romantic Suspense.

"4.5 StarsReviewed by Angela and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogAfter a big disappointment from the last book in this series, I was a bit worried about this installment. I wasnt sure if this series had caught my attention with the first book and stopped there. Im happy to tell you that that is not the case. A Bad Boy for Christmas is an entertaining holiday read, and Ms. Lemmon did not disappoint.Connor is in town after spending some time in the military. While visiting his friend Donovan, he meets Faith, who automatically catches his attention. They quickly become friends and fall in love but because of their jaded pasts, they both have reservations that will prevent any kind of commitment.I love Connor and Faith story. Its a story about two people finding love after their hearts have been broken, a second chance if you will. The journey to their happy-ending was a bit complicated. It was full of fear and doubt that I couldnt blame them for. They also had to deal with Connors military background and the Shelbys so-called family curse. As I said, they had a lot going against them but it was obvious that they wanted to try.Their story is not all about their fears and reservations. Their courtship was adorable. The banters were hilarious, and the flirting and even the use of pet names were uber sweet. The holiday theme was added in a subtle way making it a great read to ease us into the holiday spirit.There were plenty of page times for the other-other characters, and thats always a treat for me. There has also been some development in the Asher-Glo department, and its a doozy. We get plenty of Asher and Glo page time in this novel. Let me tell you, you will feel so bad for them both as their world is about to collapse on them. I can feel an ugly cry kind of story brewing there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35CHW4KL7JYFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTY0BJ0#wasThisHelpful","R35CHW4KL7JYFZ","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogI was really looking forward to this story because Ive been intrigued by Gibson and I wanted to explore more of the Domme psyche in this series.  I find it a bit fascinating to see the switch of power and often very hot!BREAK ME DOWN is no exception to that rule.  Although I wouldve enjoyed seeing their story explored in more detail in a full length novel instead of a novella, I think Ms. Loren did an amazing job at making their dynamics work both in and out of the bedroom.Both Sam and Gibson have a lot in their past that truly shaped them into who they are today.  And those pasts can be what stops them from being together.  Sam wont hide her dominant nature anymore and Gibson has it ingrained in him that to submit would make him weak and after what hes gone through, he cant be weak.  This novella explores them getting over those hurdles and battling their own demons to get their HEA.  Because the pull is too much, and their chemistry too big to deny.I always sound like I repeat myself when it comes to this author, and in a way I am.  With every story that Ms. Loren writes I fall more in love.  Shes one of my top go to erotic romance authors because her stories are always guaranteed to be extremely hot but that in no way takes away from the storyline, which is full of juicy and emotional layers that need to be peeled back slowly.  I cannot recommend this series enough.  And BREAK ME DOWN does not disappoint.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6R6HICOFQSAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISEOM2C#wasThisHelpful","R6R6HICOFQSAW","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Angela and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogRescuing a Bad Boy was an anticipated read for me. I could not wait to get my hands on it, and when I did, I read it right away. Unfortunately, it did not live to my expectations. The storyline was good, the writing was great, but the hero was a jerk and has done something that is, in my opinion beyond forgiveness.Seven years passed, but Sophie still remembers the heartache she felt when she lost her virginity to Donovan. He used her and left her with no word. Now, he is back in town to arrange the sale of his grandmothers property. But first, he agrees to have a scheduled event to take place as the propertys last hurrah. This event will reunite him with Sophie reigniting the attraction they felt years before. Forgive and forget is the only way they will survive a friendship or relationship.Sadly, I couldnt do it. I couldnt forgive him for what hes done to Sophie. I thought he was an arrogant ass. I wish he owned up to his mistake without making excuses. Instead, he stuck with his reasoning and expected Sophie to understand. Lucky for him, She took the time to understand him. I think she couldve made him work a little harder. I wasnt happy that she had already slept with him even before calling him out on what had happened in the past. There were some things that Donovan did to change for the better and make amends. I give him that. Unfortunately, he just never won me back. =(Please note that despite, my dislike for the hero, it does not affect my opinion of this author. Her writing is excellent, and I plan to continue reading her books. In fact, I recently finished A Bad Boy for Christmas, the next installment in this series, and Im glad to report that it was a much better read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J3DJ2Z5X4DMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NERQR5I#wasThisHelpful","R2J3DJ2Z5X4DMQ","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 StarsReviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogI think this is one of those cases about timing.  I mean that in the sense that had I read this book a few years back, I probably wouldve enjoyed it more.  It has Shayla Blacks distinct stamp of erotic suspense that I normally really enjoy.  But I do find that with a shorter story like this it can be hard to tie in a good suspense storyline and a romance that in this case doesnt have much of a backstory.Alejandro owns a kink club, and hes wanted to get the sexy professional dancer Shanna in his grasp for a while now.  He gets the perfect opportunity when she comes to him for help to try and find the person from his clientele at the kink that club that is blackmailing her dance partner.One thing is for certain Alejandro and Shanna have great chemistry and the sex scenes are really hot.  But I found Shannas readily disposition to scene with Alejandro when she had never done anything of the like was a bit unbelievable.  As I mentioned before, had this been a full length novella Im sure this wouldve been taken care of.My only complaint about the audiobook of this book was the fact that the narrator kept pronouncing the heros nickname wrong.  Since Alejandro is spanish, his nickname Ale should be pronounced more like Aleh than Ali.  It kept throwing me off everytime!  Nevertheless, this was an enjoyable read if youre looking for something quick and sexy and that stands completely on its own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DCK9KYLIMRDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZXO3MG#wasThisHelpful","R2DCK9KYLIMRDL","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogIve been curious about Marcus for a while now.  He had left the town of Storm and left behind his mom and sisters who were getting a pretty raw deal from his father.  It struck me as strange that he wouldnt be the man of the house and protect his mom then.  And then there were the hints that Brittany liked him.  Being from opposite sides of the track was definitely a draw for me.So Marcus is back in this installment and ready to face some of his demons.  Now that his dad is gone, and someone else had to step in to make that happen, he thinks he can just pick up the pieces of his family and move back on with his life.  It was nice to see him dealing with a bit more remorse than that, but I cant say he became my favorite person in town.His relationship with Brittany to me is a mix of wanting her and wanting to stick it to the big man, so I wasnt as happy about that.In the end, there are some new developments in this installment but I couldnt quite connect as much as I wanted, id didnt move the storyline along enough and this is not one that left me wanting the next one desperately.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BHTWMJKKBJ8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XJ05OO#wasThisHelpful","R2BHTWMJKKBJ8O","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 StarsReviewed by Angela and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogThough short in its length, Melody Anne made Following Her a very satisfying read. It was sweet, funny and an unexpected surprise, a hint of suspense.Ellas life is in danger with death threats as she works on a legal case against her ex-boyfriend. Death threats have been issued, and her cousin Bryson convinces his FBI friend to check up on her. Axel plans to guard Ella from afar but as luck would have it, he cant stay away from her. Despite Ellas protest, the attraction between them cannot be denied, and Axel is persistent to keep her safe and win her heart.This book was such a fun read. I love that Ella was independent and because, of her jaded past, she is cautious about getting involved. She wasnt annoying and didnt overact, simply a very smart heroine. Of course, Axel stood out the most. He made me laugh with his flirtings, innuendos and persistence to woo Ella. He was so easy to fall in-love with. The hint of suspense surprised me. I was afraid that it would overtake the romance but Melody did a great job completing the story without any issues.This novella is a stand alone, and I recommend trying it if youve ever wanted to give this author a try or if youre just looking for a new series to follow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHBL9NJ9IR0QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42X0JM#wasThisHelpful","RHBL9NJ9IR0QF","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Suzanne and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogWhat do you do when you want to get rid of your V-card at the ripe old age of 27, but the man you want to do it is Matt Quinn, your brothers best friend who doesnt remember youand also a male escort? Simple. You hire him out. At least, thats the tactic that Mia decides to take, what could possibly go wrong?This book has more cliches than you can shake a stick at; lusting after your brothers best friend; the male escort; gay best friends and a cinderella transfromation. Of course, despite (or maybe because) of this jumble of different Romance Land staples, I couldnt help but enjoy it.Belle Aurora gives us a lovely romance, between an unlikely pair, Quinn male escort and the cute and quiet Mia. Despite Mia contacting Quinn for sexual services, they beginning of their relationship is very sweet and this almost (not quite though) reads as a friends-to-lovers type romance. They have a series of funny text and email messages that start their relationship off and pretty soon the sparks are flying, although the romance is kind of cute, its also kind of sexy as well; Quinn certainly knows how to talk dirty!A quick and easy read, that although wasnt anything new or original, still left me smiling and glad I had picked it up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PPYI6XC2OZNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010L8T5RO#wasThisHelpful","R2PPYI6XC2OZNK","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogI have a confession to make.  When I first started reading NUTS I was momentarily scared this would read like a bit of a cookbook with the amount of detail the author was giving us on the day to day life and thinking of our heroine Roxie.  But by the time she meets Leo and nuts and sugar snaps go flying (literally) I was charmed.NUTS is fun and quirky with a small town vibe.  You will fall head over heels for farmer Leo in all his bearded glory over and over.  I can guarantee that.  There are so many layers to the man that I kept thinking he cant get any better and then he did.  Hes the perfect good guy hero but has just the right amount of spice to keep his woman satisfied.  Charmed, I tell you!Roxie left her hometown to fulfill her dream of being a chef.  She was the awkward kid back in high school, her mom was the town hippie who owned a diner and was always too in love with love and changing boyfriends like underwear.  She vowed to be everything her mother wasnt.  And its her mothers free spirit that brings her back to town when she goes off to participate in the Amazing Race and leaves Roxie in charge of the family diner for the summer.What Roxie thought would just be a summer flight with the sexy and mysterious farmer quickly turns into something deeper.  The chemistry between Roxie and Leo was just perfect and their relationship grew organically just exactly how I wanted to see.  There isnt any unnecessary drama and angst although there is one hurdle they must overcome that I thought was PERFECTION on Ms. Claytons part.  See the falling even more in love with Leo part above.In classic Clayton fashion, this book has some laugh out loud moments that are a bit over the top and some great banter.  It almost brought me back to the love I had for Wallbanger when I first read that and sort of lost as that series progressed.I am so excited about this new series and Im already itching to read the next one, CREAM, although it doesnt come out until next year.  And Im seriously hoping its about the tall, dark and silent cheese maker   Sounds like I need to move upstate!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27RT9M5G1GLEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCHYCM#wasThisHelpful","R27RT9M5G1GLEO","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogIf there is one thing I always look forward as the holidays approach is the guaranteed Jaci Burton holiday themed short story.  There is something special and magical about how she perfectly blends the spirit of the holidays with the heart of her stories.  HOT HOLIDAY NIGHTS is a bit different than some of the others shes done in that its not a sport I wouldve expected to see from her (surfing!) and its not characters Im overly familiar with.Color me surprised because this is the first threesome in the series!  The sizzling chemistry between Alex and Victoria, and then Victoria and Ben was enough to warm up any winters night.  Add in to that the fact that Alex and Ben have been best friends for years but they are both at very different stages in their lives and are also different ages, I think it brings the perfect balance and complement to the story.It was nice and refreshing seeing an older heroine who makes no apologies for what she wants and likes and isnt afraid to take it, even if that involves a hot surfer dude who is younger than her and not caring how others might see that and how she might fit in with his younger crowd.  But it was also nice to see the completely different dynamics between her and Ben as I found they had a better connection and more things in common.Either way, this was a great and quick read and it only leaves me excited about seeing more from this series.  After 10 books, its still going strong as one of my go to series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZNOGG3RPO65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013D6629A#wasThisHelpful","RSZNOGG3RPO65","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogWow!  I am pleasantly shocked at how much I enjoyed this.  Why shocked?  Because it tests my comfort levels to deal with all this emotional tangled mess.  There are a lot of blurred lines here and I would normally throw this out the window because I cant take it but its a testament to a great author that instead of doing that Im drawn and compelled to know how this will end.  And I honestly dont know what outcome I prefer.So if youve read the first book you know the arrangement between Gabe/Mirella and Weston/Bridgette had come to an end because feelings were starting to get involved.  But it was abrupt and too many things were left open.  When Weston reaches out and pushes (mighty hard) for a new arrangement, I was both thrilled and heartbroken.  I wanted to see these two couples heal from what theyd done but I also wanted to explore this new side of Weston that we were glimpsing.And that is exactly what THE GROUND RULES REWRITTEN is about.  Yes, the arrangement is back, but this was so different than the first.  If anything, its only left me more torn about the whole situation.  My emotions were a mess!  This is told again from Mirellas POV and we get to see more of her interactions with her husband as well as with Weston.  Let me just say this.  Both Gabe and Weston are amazing and Mirella has off the charts chemistry with both.  The sex scenes were killer and then when you get the jealousy involved and maybe let one watch. *dies*This was an all-nighter read for me.  I thought I would just start this up at 10pm for a bit before I went to bed and I was compelled to read more until I finished it in the wee hours of the morning.  It was unputdownable.  Yeah, I made that word up. I must warn you this ends in a cliffhanger and it leaves me DYING for the next book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5LRRTGVL0ONT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WQ3QZG#wasThisHelpful","R5LRRTGVL0ONT","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Suzanne and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogWhen Lev Leokov catches a bedraggled woman stealing his brothers wallet, he cant help butwant to help her. She brings out emotions, feelings in him that he is told he is incapable of. Mina Harris is starving. She knows if she doesnt get money or something to eat soon shes going to die. However, she didnt know stealing someones wallet would change her life so dramatically, and for the better. Lev offers what she has always wanted, a warm bed, food and a jobeither that or the cops. Shell take her chances with Lev.Im in love. Belle Aurora now has me seriously considering going to gentlemans clubs, as she euphemistically calls strip clubs, and stealing scary Russians wallets. It may be worth the danger for a chance of some Lev lovin. Thankfully I pulled myself back, Im pretty sure with my luck, if I went round pinching guys wallets I would just get nicked and the chances of any sexy Russians living in my area who will swoop to my rescue are slim to none. Dream dashed.Anyway, enough of my sordid fantasies and more on Lev the first book in Belle Auroras Shot Callers series. As you can tell, I really enjoyed it, consumed it in one sitting and was left desperately wanting more. It was sweet, funny and sexy, stuffed to the brim with really likable characters who I cant wait to see more about in the future.The stars in this book though were Lev and Mina. Lev is a little different, he has trouble recognising and processing emotions, which to some makes him seem emotionless and means he doesnt always react the way someone else would. Mina has been homeless for seven years, and when she enters the story, she is emaciated, dirty and desperate. But, despite how dark these aspects have the potential to become, this isnt a dark romance that focuses on Minas bad experiences on the street, or Levs struggle with his emotions and relationships. In fact, it mainly glosses over this, especially Minas homelessness and this is instead a really sweet romance.I really liked that this book showed Mina developing relationships with more than just Lev, although they were the main focus, it showed her building friendships and finding her place within Levs family. This meant we got a bit of backstory about each of the characters, who I am sure will eventually get their own book eventually, and made it seem like you were being embraced by the whole family, a family I cant wait to get back to.However, this book is almost a carbon copy of Belle Auroras Friend-Zoned series, which I also enjoy, the set up is similar as are the characters, which makes sense as Shot Callers is a spin off. So dont expect any surprises from Lev, what you can expect though is a few laughs, a lot of aww moments and a great time, I highly recommend  you give it a chance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30319S1S6MXJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016GTW5M4#wasThisHelpful","R30319S1S6MXJE","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 StarsGuest Reviewed by Jennifer and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogTara Sue Me is writing as Cat Waters in Obscured, and its really not like anything weve seen from her before. Athena Hamilton moved to Las Vegas at sixteen with big dreams that fell flat. For ten years, shes worked as a high end prostitute, having been the victim of a ruthless pimp whos trapped her in his world. She sees no way out until she has an unexpected run-in with an old friend, Isaiah Martin. Hes kind and understanding, offering to shelter her and aid her escape. Complication? Hes a pastor and she knows she can never fit into his life, no matter how much she yearns for normalcy. The truth, however, remains obscuredpeople are never as they appear to be at first glance. Who can Athena trust to deliver her from a life that seems beyond saving?Obscured is the perfect title for this novel that packs an insane amount of twists and turns into a quick read. I absolutely stayed up until 2am to finish, as it was impossible to put down. The genre is not clear cut, blending romance, suspense, and thriller elements. I found it pretty unpredictable on most counts. Oh, and if youre looking for BDSM elements, you wont find them here. This is a big step away from what were used to with Tara Sue Me, and I believe it proves that she has talent as a storyteller above and apart from BDSM erotic romance. You will be introduced to the very seedy and scary world of sex trafficking. Athenas story is likely all too familiar to many girls. She is abused, used, and coerced, her life threatened almost daily if she doesnt perform like the trained property shes seen as. The entire book has an undertone of sex, even if we dont see many acts performed on the pages. As Ive mentioned, there IS a romance. Its nothing like youd expect, but as short as this book is (my only real complaint), it ends up being so beautifully emotional and well written that I was truly captivated. I cant even give the details to avoid spoilers, but the hero is an absolute keeper, a larger than life protector that had me weak in the knees in a completely genuine, and unsappy way. It ends on a cliffhanger, for two characters, but not in terms of HEA for the hero and heroine.

"3.5 StarsReviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogThis was my first Holiday read of the year and to my surprise it was a lot shorter than I was expecting.  Yes, I know, its a novella.  But I was still expecting a bit more.  I have read other novellas where the author manages to give me enough story in the page count that Im satisfied with their HEA.  In this case, although I enjoyed the novella, I felt the HEA it was rushed.As far as the characters go, I really enjoyed Crispin, the Duke of Hurst, and our unlikely heroine Miss Gwen Primm.  Her family is definitely one that I would love to read more about because they are all women with personality that dont care to follow the rules of society and etiquette necessarily.  So in that respect, Gwen was right along my alley.  Especially when the first thing that happens when she meets the hero is that she hits him in the face with a fruit basket. I wouldve loved to see this fleshed out in a full length story just to lend more credibility to the fact that these two have fallen in love and are headed for marriage.

"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogI will give you a quick warning to start.  If you havent read THE QUEEN OF ZOMBIE HEARTS (Book 3) and you dont want spoilers, then I would say dont continue reading this review as the main plot of this book revolves around one spoiler from that book.  That being said and if you dont care.I was shocked when Ms. Showalter announced there would be another book in this series.  Book 3 sort of wraps things up in a neat enough way that you could consider that an end, but I understand that it also leaves other people a bit broken hearted behind.  It was nice to see her give all the characters a happy ending.  Mainly, in this case, Frosty.I always had the feeling that Kat was going to die because of her disease, so Frosty would end up alone.  But after Kat is killed in the last book things get shaken up a bit.  He starts off this book a devastated mess, not caring about much and trying to cope with the loss the best way he can.  Until Kats spirit comes to protect him by assigning Camilla to be his bodyguard, as she is meant to save his life at one point soon.Sigh Frosty and Camilla.  I felt almost bad for liking them together so much!  I shouldve had more love for Kat, no?  As much as I love Kats personality she was just not right for Frosty in the end and only seeing him with Camilla I realized that.  The only thing that gave me pause about this whole situation was the fact that Frosty was supposedly in love with Kat!  Unless that all was bull, I just found it a bit hard to swallow that he would fall so deep and so fast for Camilla.  But like I said, that doesnt take away from the fact the ARE perfect for each other and it was nice to see them open up.This book doesnt lack for action and it was, as with every book in this series, an entertaining read!  I find that maybe the romance aspect was a bigger focus in this book than the previous books in the series, but it still gave a finality to the Anima Industries storyline.  It gave me a closure in many ways I didnt know I needed and is the perfect ending to the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK234XUN9YYOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URK07F6#wasThisHelpful","RK234XUN9YYOB","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 StarsReviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogAfter the high from CROSSWINDS I was hoping this would pick up right where that one left off.  But as it is with these stories, theyve each had a focus on a certain group of characters, so it was time to switch things up a bit here.  the cliffhanger we are left with in CROSSWINDS isnt address much in this story but we do get to know Logan Murphy more.Hes the soldier returning from Afghanistan.  We get a small glimpse of him and his demons in the previous installment and this episode is the build up of his relationship with Ginny Moreno.Ginny Moreno and Logan Murphy had an attraction before he went away, but with the age difference it never went anywhere.  Now that it can, itll be built on lies and half truths.  And boy, will this web get ever so tangled.  I have no idea how this can all get resolved without major truths coming out and heartache to result from it.  These two are a couple I will be rooting for.  I just dont know how they can make it work in the end.I admit the interest for the characters is not at an all time high, but these stories are quick and entertaining.  Although I would prefer to start seeing a bit of resolutions instead of adding more to the pile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F35DNGFXITMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XJKFJE#wasThisHelpful","R2F35DNGFXITMG","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Angela and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogTrouble is stirring up in this small town of Rosewood. Madelyn Chamberland the local baker and the Emmett Sawyer the bar owner is having a quarrel over the noise the bars music and loud patrons are making at night. Feeling fed up, Madelyn escalates her complaints by bringing in the cops in the picture. But the plan backfires and both are sentenced to clean up the illegal artwork of the Penis Picassotogether. Of course, leaving them with no choice but to get to know each other on a deeper level.Ms. Laurence had a few things going here that kept me flipping the pages. First is the romance between Madelyn and Emmet. I cant help wanting to know how they end up together despite the hate they had for each other in the beginning. I irony of falling in love with the person they avoided in the first place just made me laugh. The misconceptions about each other were even funnier. Ms. Laurence also made a point of pointing out Madelyns character in high school. She was not the nice person she has become but to her defence; she tried to make amends. I love that Ms. Laurence made her accountable for her actions and didnt make it easy to get out of that hole. Lets face it, forgiving that mean girl in high school doesnt usually happen. But, they can change for the better. Last, Emmett. He had a bad boy aura that any woman would like to tame. There was this steamy scene and he had me fanning myself. Ill admit, I just wanted to read more about him.Stirring Up Trouble is a cute small-town read. It has all the qualities of a small town romance including the gossiping townspeople, the relatives at every corner and the protagonist who loves being in this type of community. The ending was a little corny, and I think it couldve been better, but it was cute enough that I was satisfied with the overall story line.spacer","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TEGP2DIHJLZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCNHXW#wasThisHelpful","R3TEGP2DIHJLZY","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Guest Reviewed by Jennifer and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogSparrow Beckett is a writing team of two kinky authors who have come together to bring us the new Masters Unleashed series.  Finding Master Right is book one of this endeavor.  Kate is intrigued and turned on by the thought of being controlled by a dominant man.  When her friend invites her to a D/s matchmaking party, she finds herself unsure and doubting what she wants.  Her friends think Banner would be the perfect Dominant to help her discover what kind of Dom she wants, no strings attached.  Banner is looking for a slave, not a submissive, so it should be easy for him to show her the ropes and then let her loose to submit to the perfect Dom.  Things seem to never go as planned, as both Banner and Kate find it almost impossible to resist the pull between them.  If theyre able to find a common ground remains to be seen.As you might be able to tell from my usual reads, I often gravitate towards the darker side of BDSM.  In that sense, Finding Master Right is a bit out of my norm.  I wasnt sure from the blurb that I would be able to enjoy an introduction to BDSM themed book.  Its a pleasure to be proven wrong here, because I really did love this one.  At first glance, Kate might seem to be that friend that wants to try something new and wild for reasons that are hard to comprehend.  She really doesnt know what or who she wants at the onset, but thats certainly a realistic position for someone to find themselves in.  Shes also a bonafide brat:  snarky, funny and really very cute.  Banner might want a slave, but hes approachable and good-natured, up for the challenge that Kate proves to be.  What made the book for me was the realistic dialog and the genuine chemistry between the characters.  Kate challenges Banner mercilessly and he doesnt back down, but he accommodates her needs and adjusts his own expectations.  The negotiations they go through, the give and take, really is a great look at a successful and healthy start to a D/s relationship.  The chemistry between them made the sex scenes smoldering hot.  I couldnt get enough of seeing these two banter back and forth.  You could feel Kates need, her desire to be topped, bleed through her protective outer core.  I wanted to slap Banner for thinking he knew what was best for Kate at one point, but he came around in the end.  I know this was written by a writing team, but it was so seamless that I wasnt able to tell, even with viewpoints switching here and there.  I was absolutely hooked from the beginning and it was a truly fun read.  In the end, its refreshing to see characters that arent plugged into the cookie-cutter images that we expect.  Fun BDSM books that dont lack substance are also hard to come by.  I think Finding Master Right is a perfect intro for someone to the genre, but also very satisfying for the more experienced reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUZLJ5TQN69EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGZOH1E#wasThisHelpful","RUZLJ5TQN69EK","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Angela and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogNeed You for Always is a sweet and sexy small town romance novel that had my heart melt into a puddle of emotions.  It sounds repetitive but there is no other way to say it except Adair, yet again, did not disappoint.  Kudos Marina, I yet again couldnt hold my tears from falling.Emmerson Blake has given up a lot since her mom died.  She has dedicated her life to helping her dad and little sister survive the tragedy that had hit their lives.  Now, her dream of owning her gourmet food truck is within reach. All she needs is to earn a little more money, and the truck is hers. To her surprize, the part time job she inquired about is offered by no other than Dax, her one-night-stand from several months back. Second thoughts came to mind, but she is determined to buy that truck.Army Ranger Dax Boudin has come back home to recover from his injuries, but he has no plans to stay permanently.  He has his mind set on a job in San Jose, about two hours south of St. Helena.  But as any small town life goes, avoiding anyone from your past is almost impossible and he found himself needing to spend time with Emi and her overwhelming life.  The biggest problem is how he will keep it to a no-strings kind of relationship so, leaving will not be a problem.It was easy to fall in love with Emerson and Daxs story.  Their chemistry was off the grid.  They couldnt stop themselves from flirting and throwing innuendos at each other.  They made me smile and laugh but what I love most is that they both have issues that were easily solved by the other.  They simply fit.  Of course, Dax was charming in his own right.  Not to mention sweet, sexy and romanticwhen he wanted to be.Emis sister was the most adorable part of the story.  Finding out how strong she is in this book, made me tear up and at the end, left me a feeling happy.  Of course, it always put a smile on my face when I get a glimpse of the Deluca family, as well, as the folks in this small town.Next up is the Firefighter Boudin Brother.  The sneak peek at the end of this book will have you wanting more of him.  I can tell that Need You for Mine will be full of funny banters and lots of flirtings.

"4.5 StarsGuest Reviewed by Jennifer and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogNicolette Hugo has a spellbinding way with words that captured me in her debut, The Arrangement.  Exhibition: Unchained Vice continues in the same world, with a few characters you might recognize from a party in The Arrangement.  Grace Cantrell is a therapist with a kink for exhibitionism, but a past misjudgment has left her questioning her needs and scared to dip her foot in the pool again.  When Jason Wright, a photographer with a sadistic side, sees her on display at a party, he is drawn to her like a moth to a flame.  Their interaction leaves Grace stunned and she knows shes falling down the rabbit hole again.  Still, it might not have been enough to keep her from walking away had a tragedy at work not left her on a voluntary leave for three weeks.  Desperately seeking release from the pain, Grace approaches Jason and they enter into an informal arrangement with no rules and only a safe word to save her should she be pushed too far.Exhibition is a more fully fleshed out story than its predecessor, in that we get to see this relationship evolve from first meeting.  Grace is damaged in ways that are revealed later in the book and this makes her both hesitant and hungry since shes denied herself her true nature for so long.  I truly felt sympathy for her as a character trying to navigate the waters of uncertainty, surrounded by those who get her kink and others who see it only as self-destruction.  Jasons sadism is well developed and hes very experienced in dishing out pain.  He is well known in the circles he operates in, but I did want to get a deeper look at what made him tick, a hint of his past.  Whether wielding a whip or a needle, I could feel all of the air being sucked out of the room, sense the anticipation and fear that he elicited.  Ive said it before, but Hugos prose really is very poetic and poignant, without being syrupy.  She is able to distill down what makes the submissive crave what they do, how they cope with a scene, how they feel in subspace in a way that I find unique.  Again, this is a much more character driven story than is the norm lately.  While there are a few parties and some group play, the scenes and the emotions that surround them are the stars here, which is just how I like it.  The Arrangement wasnt mild play, by any means, but Exhibition pushes into territory that is on the more hardcore side of pain.  I loved the honesty and the realism thats used to show the characters reactions to pain, how it feeds their needs.  Ive hinted at some of the implements used and you can expect both pointy and hot things ;).  The first outing Jason and Grace have together was truly one of the most unique Ive read in a kink themed book.  You have to be willing to test your boundaries just like Grace and if youre open, its hot beyond belief.  This is erotic romance, so Grace and Jason get an absolutely beautiful HEA, one that Im supremely jealous of.  If you can handle the more edgy side of play, this is a stellar second installment in this series.  Im now a fully-fledged fan and eagerly await what comes next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OF05RPI3NJU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGV2UVA#wasThisHelpful","R3OF05RPI3NJU8","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 StarsReviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogLara Adrian has me eating my words. Just when I had said that the newer characters of the series havent been holding my attention as well as the first few books has, Adrian brings out a story that not only has vividly developed characters but it also has the suspense and the romance that remind me of the first books so much. More impressive is the fact that this is only a novella.However, all this shouldnt actually be that surprising considering the fact that Lara Adrian has been one of my favorite authors for some time now and her writing has always been impeccable. But there was something about this book that made me enjoy it so much more. First off, its set in Morocco and Rome, two very different but equally stunning places. I loved what the atmosphere of these settings brought to the story and it definitely added much more appeal to me as a reader.Also, the premise of the story is quite unique as well. Jehan and and Seraphina are bound together by ancients laws and their families. To prevent war from occurring, they must join together in a love match. They have a few ceremonies to do and eight nights to get to know each other and decide if they can go through with this. This idea works very well with a short novella. The time constraint creates that urgency while also upping the stakes a little bit. Surprisingly, Adrian is able to fit a well-formed romance and some action scenes in here as well.I couldnt put this down! STROKE OF MIDNIGHT has definitely rekindled my love for the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NYBBN73ZVJJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVMJ2F8#wasThisHelpful","R2NYBBN73ZVJJQ","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Theres just something very cozy and fun about it all. However despite the fact that there is the word Christmas in the title, there isnt too much holiday stuff that going on. At least in the more traditional way as I was expecting. There is some charity work since that is Chloes job but I think I was just expecting a banquet of food, Christmas songs and the man in the red suit. But after I got over my initial expectations, I found that I could still enjoy the story.As this is a short story, the romance does heat up pretty quickly. Im hesitant to say it was instalove because Chloe and Nate do have some issues they need to sort out so Id rather call it instalust because that was clearly the case with these two when they first meet each other.A fun, lighthearted read, CHRISTMAS WITH THE BILLIONAIRE RANCHER is sure to put you in the sexy mood!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9XPCHW69C0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122RZRG0#wasThisHelpful","R2P9XPCHW69C0T","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogWho wouldve thoughtCROSSWINDS is the third installment in the Rising Storm serial and this one focuses on the younger kids of Storm.  I was expecting to be as uninterested as I was with the previous installment because I dont usually care for teenage drama.  But Elisabeth Naughton proved me wrong!This book deals with the topic of cheating and lies.  But also how people deal with grief differently.  It can break you down or turn you mean! And definitely will test who you are as a person.Luis Morenos girlfriend Mallory is still dealing with her father walking out on the family, while Luis himself still has to deal with the emotional aftermath of his sisters accident and pregnancy.  But now Mallorys best friend, and his childhood crush, Lacey might have feelings for him as well!If you cant handle cheating, I would recommend you stay away from this whole serial in general.  Like Ive said before, this is more like a soap opera so you can expect cheating and best friends hurting each other.  Jealousy and an intricate web of lies that will ruin lives when it all comes crashing down.This was an exciting installment in the saga and my favorite so far!  When you are finished with this one youll want to have the next one in your hands right away.

"3.5 StarsReviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogI have had a soft soft for Ms. MacAlister dragons ever since I picked up You Slay Me years ago.  I cant say Ive followed along ALL the spin offs but I have read quite a few of them.  This is now the Black Dragons and someone that if youve read the previous you are familiar with.  Kostya.Im not usually the biggest fan of the main characters in these stories, theyre always ok to bring the story forward but not ones Ill fall for in the long run.  Aoife and Kostya have an instant attraction and although their romance was fun, I think the connection wasnt quite as developed, relying more on the mate bond.  Which is fine for me as well in my paranormal romance books.If you havent read any books in the collection of dragons by Ms. MacAlister just know that each books stands alone quite well, although since there are cameos you will enjoy seeing them or appreciate them more if you follow along with the collection.  You can expect them to be filled with stubborn dragon males and fiery heroines, kick ass sidekicks, and facing over the top scenarios.  But most importantly they will make you laugh!A big part of my enjoyment in these books comes from the sidekicks.  In this case we get to see Jim, the demon dog, again.  Ive said this before but I would buy a book of simply Jim quotes.  Hes amazing!!!  I cannot tell you how much I love Jims character, hes a breath of fresh air and always has the best lines!  This book wouldnt have been the same without him.The formula works out almost the same so I like that I know what Im getting into when I pick one of these up.  Theyre set usually somewhere in Europe, theres dragons fighting, and somehow the heroine always ends up being a key player in their storylines.  I will be looking out for the next book in the series for sure!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X4TLWJ7DXD9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P74VFSA#wasThisHelpful","R1X4TLWJ7DXD9O","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogHeres a series that I think should be getting more attention.  This is the end of the Adrenaline Highs series and as the previous books in the series, you can expect some suspense mixed in with some Hollywood fun.  ALWAYS DANGEROUS features the leading man in the DANGEROUS RACE film, Leo Frost.  Leo is a Hollywood superstar, and most people think of him as a playboy with a dont care attitude.  He had a quick fling with Kim Jacobs months back after she helped him through his financial crisis.  Since then, he hasnt stopped thinking about her.  Even though she doesnt even live in California.Kim on the other hand has been going through a lot in her family life.  One of her very few relatives, her aunt, passed away, and left her not only almost without family (only her cousin still lives) but a millionaire.  In the midst of dealing with that and how it will impact her life going forward she also realizes shes pregnant with Leos child.  Secret baby lovers rejoice!Of course, as is to be expected, there is an element of suspense.  Someone is trying to kill Kim after she goes to California to tell Leo the news.  Dee J. Adams does a great job at mixing just the right amount of excitement in with the romance and the pace of the developing relationship between Kim and Leo was perfect.  Theyre sexy together and have great chemistry.  Even considering they had history starting out, you get a full picture.The issues Leo had with commitment and having kids were understandable and I was glad to see common sense won out without too much angst and drama for him.  I had the bad guy pegged from the very beginning so the mystery of who could be doing this is not necessarily the reason why I enjoy this, its more the execution which is thoroughly entertaining!Now that this series is done, Ill be looking out to see what Dee J. Adams has in store next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EI0G4O5AEJOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XN0KMW#wasThisHelpful","R3EI0G4O5AEJOA","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogWICKED EVER AFTER is the bittersweet ending of the Blud series.  If youve been following the series, this is a must read as it goes back to Trish and Criminy and gives closure to their story as well as the other couples you see throughout the series.  Word to the wise, this novella CANNOT stand alone.  It just wouldnt make as much sense without the background of the rest of the series.I was glad to see Trish deal with her issues at becoming a Bludwoman, but maybe I wasnt too happy with how that turned out necessarily.  We also get a shocking turn of events with Trishs grandmother, but I dont want to spoil things for you, so youll just have to read and see.That being said, Criminy was my absolute favorite part of this story.  Hes still dashing and wonderful and even sweeter and sexier if thats even a possibility.  His love for Trish shines through repeatedly through all the over the top scenarios we see in this book.  Theres action, theres danger, theres family drama!  WICKED EVER AFTER is over the top but ties in all the loose ends giving perfect closure.  And in the end, I was left with a happy sigh after the 10 years later epilogue. <3I am sad to see this series end, when I thought there were infinite possibilities of stories to be told in the creepy world of Sang.

"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogIve been patiently waiting for Kit and Noahs book because I knew there would be tension and sparks right off the bat.  But this book was actually much different than what I thought their story would be like.  I cant call this an enemies to lovers story because at the core of the story theyre best friends.  Even though they have been burned, hurt and need to heal.Ms. Singh knows how to write a tortured hero like no other.  Oftentimes when authors try to do that they make up a flimsy story as to why the hero is as messed up as he is.  This book makes no apologies.  Noah really went through a lot and has not recovered emotionally from that.  I was in a way glad to see he has real issues he needs to work through.  And they are not swept under the rug completely in the end either.  They will be ongoing issues that he will have to learn how to deal with.  And finding love was just the beginning of that healing process.That being said, this is not a fast book.  ROCK REDEMPTION is all about that slow burn.  Although I enjoyed that in this story, I know some people are not fans of that.  But I think the development of their relationship couldnt have been done at any other pace to make it believable.One thing you know you can expect from this author is well executed plots, great character relationships not only between the main couple but their group of friends as well, and the characters themselves full of layers that you slowly get to peel back and slowly fall for.  Once I immersed myself into ROCK REDEMPTION, I didnt come up for air until I had read the last word.  If you love seeing damaged characters heal and get a chance at happiness, then youll enjoy this one!  Not quite hitting the mark to knock Rock Hard off my favorite in the series spot, but a close second.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O0D2VJSTFIIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142YLRUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2O0D2VJSTFIIL","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most importantly, he tells his story on how his relationship with Charley Davidson came to be and how her bright light saved him time and time again.  Included is a very intimate sexy scene sure to make Reyes fans want more.BTTS is my top pick novella for the year.  Despite its short length, it had everything I expected and more.  Reyes tortured past floored me.  I cried for him and relieved he had Charleys light to help him survive it all.  Darynda gave her fans the pleasure of getting to know Reyes on a deeper level.

Just as she is about to leave for a blind date, Parker appears and because Zoe has absolutely no clue what she is doing, she kisses him right there and then on her front step. It comes as a shock to her when she realizes hes her brothers best friend. Talk about awkwardness, huh?If youre a big fan of Contemporary Romances and love the style in which Jill Shalvis does it, then Im sure youll enjoy this one. It has everything I usually like in a Rom Com but as I was reading this one, I felt like I could guess everything that was going to happen. I dont know if its because Ive read so many Jill Shalvis books that I already know her style or if this book was just too predictable.ALL I WANT is a very cute book. Theres a lot of teasing, a lot of flirting and Shalvis builds the tension very well. As this is a brothers best friend novel, this slow build was very important and I think Shalvis pulled it off well. So apart from being a little clichd, I still very much enjoyed the latest installment to the Animal Magnetism series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KBJGYV5G6GB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI026L0#wasThisHelpful","R2KBJGYV5G6GB4","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Guest Reviewed by Jennifer and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogNicolette Hugo is a brand new author to me who came highly recommended. I jumped into The Arrangement knowing it had a BDSM focus and anyone venturing in should know this too. The plot centers around Nell Harper, a successful attorney who has a chance meeting with Vincent Mason, a politician on the rise in Sydney. Vincent brings out the submissive Nell never knew was in her, and at the outset of the book, they have agreed to a six month live-in arrangement. No one could accuse Vincent of lacking in intensity and focus. He seems to be the perfect match for Nell, but the hardship comes when she realizes this arrangement is delving into territory Vincent may not comfortable with. Nell wont settle for less than love and how we get there is the delicious torment of The Arrangement.For starters, throw off any pre-conceived notions you have about BDSM in mainstream erotic romance. Vincent Mason may be well-off, but hes not living in a penthouse with a helipad. Nell Harper is a successful, smart, and accomplished. Shes no shrinking violet and can negotiate what she needs without hesitation. The Arrangement was unique for me in that we dont see the early moments, the budding relationship between Vincent and Nell. It begins with their formal 6 month arrangement. This was a great choice, as new relationships can often be fraught with an intensity and obsessiveness that clouds reason. By the time these two enter into a live-in relationship, it clear that Dom and sub are comfortable in their roles and want to be there. What also sets The Arrangement apart is its character driven focus and its beautiful prose. We are inside Nells head for the vast majority of the story, and through her, we examine what it means to submit, the whys of masochism, the beauty and comfort in non-sexual service to someone you care for. If you are at all interested in the psychology of submission, I think you will enjoy and possibly identify with Nell as a character. All of the intimate scenes are erotic and beautiful, even at their dirtiest. Some were downright mesmerizing. Vincent is a sadist, so his tastes run beyond mild kink. Readers should be prepared for edgier play, but not extreme scenarios. In the end, Nell needs and craves love and a permanence she doesnt know if Vincent can provide. I wanted to yell at these two to communicate! The interplay between them, even the non-sexual scenes, is deliciously poetic. Hugo has a distinct way with words that draws emotion out of you and I found myself highlighting passages that I dont want to leave for good. The Arrangement is a brilliant first book and this only means that more great things are to come. I cant wait to dig into Exhibition, her next installment.spacer","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ES11O4CAE3QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XM75V4S#wasThisHelpful","R1ES11O4CAE3QN","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 StarsReviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogIn book four of the Scandalous Highlanders series, Munro MacLawry finally gets his book. Munro has been present in all the books so far so I was very excited to see who the big guy was going to end up. Perhaps out of the whole bunch, Munro is the one who is keen on sowing his oats and remaining single. So it comes as a big surprise to him when he meets someone that holds his attention for more than one night.When Munro and Catriona first meet, its not your typical sweet, combustible moment. In fact, its just the opposite. As Munro is hunting, Catriona is the one to take down the buck he meant for himself.Since I was already invested in Bears character, Cat was really the only I wanted to learn more about. After running from her home to escape a marriage, she and her sister seek refuge at Haldane Abbey. I liked both girls but I just didnt love them as much as I thought I would. And even after reading it, I still dont know why. Cat is a sweet girl who has a spine of steel. Her character is actually a perfect match for Bear so I was glad they were paired together but I dont know if it was because I had such high expectations but this book was just okay for me. It was missing a lot of the things I loved about the other books in the series, namely the teasing but I think thats because Cat and Bear arent really the teasing type so I couldnt really fault the author for that.If youre looking for a fun and rowdy Highlander series, this is one you need to check out. Fans of Maya Banks McCabe Trilogy would enjoy this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZCNPOSP8DRI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UG9LCUM#wasThisHelpful","RZCNPOSP8DRI4","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Annie and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogWICKED FOR YOU is the tenth book in the Wicked Lovers series. The thing I loved about this series was that it integrated some suspense along with the more erotic side. The action definitely added something extra to the stories but I also think that as the series goes on, its getting harder and harder to come up with realistic situations that the author can put her characters in.Mystery Mullins yearns for the man who once saved her from her dangerous kidnappers. Now, years later, she still isnt able to forget Axel Dillon. Despite the flourishing career she has for herself in, she disguises herself and looks for Axel in a bar, propositioning him like she has always dreamed of.Axel doesnt remember her but after a night of unforgettable passion, hes starting to wonder where he may know her from. The whole premise of this story is a little far fetched for my liking. The fact that Axel doesnt even remember her, even with a disguise, makes me wonder how they can have such a connection on Mysterys part that lasts years and years when he doesnt even know who she is. It takes away some of the romance although I will say that I enjoyed Axels character for the most part.Axel stays true to Shayla Blacks style. Hes intense, protective and hella sexy. He was definitely my favorite part of this book. Mystery, on the other hand, I was a little hot and cold over. She has some very admiring qualities about her but then sometimes I felt that her actions seemed to come out of nowhere sometimes and that really took me out of the story. I wasnt 100% sold on her motivations but I understand that to make a story like this work, Mystery had to be the one to take initiative. It just wasnt my favorite in the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R85FFXM49IIOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI026Y2#wasThisHelpful","R85FFXM49IIOB","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Suzanne and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogNumbers contains books fourteen and fifteen in the New Species series by Laurann Dohner, thats right ladies, get your fans and an icy cold drink ready, we have a double helping of sexy, yet adorable New Species males! The stories are a little shorter, but  Numbers contains two good length novellas so you definitely havent been short changed.Book #14  Mourn formally 140You may remember Mourn from Wraths book (I think its Wrath and Laurans book, I could be wrong!) at that point, he was known as 140 and Mercile were controlling him by threatening his mate. As Mourns name implies, the fate of his mate was tragic and he now feels he has nothing to live for, until Dana comes in to his life and tries to help him through his grief.I really enjoyed this one, it was my favourite story in Numbers Mourn was a little bit wild and still adjusting to his life as a free male, which made him curiously, and adorably, innocent in some ways. And, although I debate the healthiness of replacing one mate with another to give yourself a reason to live, I still really enjoyed it. As expected it was sexy and sweet, these Species men really do know their way around a gals body!Book #15  Hero formally 927To remember 927, now known as Hero, you will need to stretch your mind back to Valiant and Tammys book. When Tammy gets kidnapped she is put in a cage with a New Species male, 927, who does his best to look after her. Now, 12 books later we are getting his book. What Hero has hidden from everyone is that when in Mercile he was raised alongside a human girl,Candi, they shared the same cell and although never consummated anything, were mates. That is, until Mercile decided to play games, resulting in Candis violent death. Her death haunts him; all he feels is a mixture of rage and loss, something he must face when Candi arrives at the gates of Homeland.Candi has to be one of my favourite heroines in this series so far, although human, she has been raised as a New Species and apart from their physical aspects, has all their traits. I really enjoyed seeing Candi and Hero face their past and once again reunite, it was really touching, not to mention sexy as they finally get to explore one another. Another aspect of this novella I liked, was seeing all the females together as they all try and teach Candi about her new world, it was great to see some the heroines from the previous books and some of the New Species women.Over all, I really enjoyed this book, both stories were great, I very quickly devoured them! I now CANNOT wait to see who is next, but Im keeping my fingers and toes crossed for Flame!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ABENXHIUVBDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014FUXNW2#wasThisHelpful","R1ABENXHIUVBDI","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Suzanne and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogTalyn Batur hasnt had life easy, as a male with a missing blood line he is deemed an Outcast, he will never be permitted to marry or have children, and is hated by his own people. But, after years of toil both in the military and as a fighter, he is determined to have something of his own to ease his loneliness a little. However, bringing Tara, a Companion into his life brings more pleasure.and pain than he can ever imagine.Phew, give me a minute! I time to recover, as always Sherrilyn Kenyon has thrown me on an emotional roller coaster and flipped the ON switch on leaving me with barely a second to pull down the safety bar. Im still slightly out of breath and dizzy but raring to go again! I cant get enough of her League series.If you have read Kenyon before, than this book is not going to throw any surprises your way, her standard recipe of: One hero, tortured to the point of near insanity, one compassionate and only slightly tortured heroine, a s*** load of social injustice, a dash of previous characters..then shake together firmly. Voila! A Sherrilyn Kenyon book has been created. And although I am poking fun at her formula, I still cant help but enjoy it, I think maybe she also adds a pinch of crackcos I am a League addict.Talyn and Felicia was almost unbearably sweet together, right from the start they suited each other perfectly and I couldnt help but be invested in their romance having a HEA. Kenyon really puts you through the emotional wringer with Born of Defiance but I really fell in love with the pair. The timeline of this one is also back to the beginning of the series and coincides with the events of Born of Night, around the time when Nyk is discovered by his family, making Born of Defiance take place in a time full of rebellion and action, something which added some extra excitement and danger to the book.Another great book in the League series and I cannot wait to read the next one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T9DT1CRD58I4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OFID7NA#wasThisHelpful","R3T9DT1CRD58I4","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 Stars.Reviewed by Suzanne and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogWhen Honeysuckle Jones, Honey to her friends, admits what she believes to be a small problem to her best friends, they come up with the perfect solution. A pianist. A pianist, with their dexterous hands is bound to solve Honeys little never-had-an-orgasm-issue, what ensues is a series of increasingly absurd dates set up by her friends, all the while, Honey cant help be drawn in by her grumpy, very rude and possible alcoholic neighbour.I picked this book up on the off chance, I wanted something fun and funny that would be perfect to kick back and relax with. I am pleased to say that is exactly what I got, it was a great mixture of funny, touching and sweet. For those of us who love a grumpy hero, this is perfect, they dont come much more ill-tempered than Hal.Hal has recently become blind and because of this his career and his fiancee have abandoned him, his solution; whisky. I enjoyed reading Honey getting to know Hal, even if he wasnt so keen, although he cant help be drawn in by her and her, at times, odd and outlandish life. It was a bit of an emotional ride as the two of them slowly build a relationship.Aside from the blooming, although slightly erratic and reluctant romance that was being built between Hal and Honey, there was also a side story involving Honey helping to save a residential home for the elderly with her team of eccentric residents and her best friends. This all added together to create a slightly off-beat, but fun romance with some charming characters.A really enjoyable read, funny, sweet and charming, I will definitely read another Kat French book in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UXZMZ1LVIZMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T2HWI2K#wasThisHelpful","R2UXZMZ1LVIZMH","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogMy level of enjoyment of POWER PLAY is a case of expectations.  The setup of this series is not something I tend to read a lot because it can get on my nerves, and I guess I didnt realize this wouldnt be an HEA book for the couple, but one of those love triangles that drags on throughout the series.  Ive made those commitments before with some books, but believe me theyre not my thing.  And I wasnt expecting that from this.  I think because of that I didnt enjoy this as much as I probably couldve otherwise.Our heroine Sage is a bit of a workaholic.  She thinks very highly of her successful boss, Parker.  So much so that she hasnt realized that all that admiration is actually something deeper.  When Parker becomes involved in a business transaction with the Russian mob, his old friend Ryker comes around snooping his involvement and immediately becomes quite taken with Parkers assistant, Sage.  Detective Ryker that is.  And Sage finds herself in the middle of a bad situation not only between the two old friends and now sort of enemies, but in the middle of a very bad deal with the bad guys.As far as the suspense element goes, this is actually really good!  Not that its suspenseful per se but its a good story, kind of like a cop show with a bit of flare for the dramatic.  Sage is just naive enough to want to do the right thing and ends up in situations that are a bit precarious.  Shes also in between two men that are polar opposites in many ways.  One the epitome of refined and successful, and the other the leather wearing, bike riding bad boy.  Reminded me a bit of Stephanie Plum in some ways, and the love triangle definitely goes in line with that as well.I was hoping for a romantic resolution in the end, and we dont get that like I mentioned before.  Im not sure if Ill continue and read the next book, maybe if Im in the right mood for it this time.  The story in itself was good so I may pick it up when Im ready for a good detective book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ECZF43LDLDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7X61FO#wasThisHelpful","R13ECZF43LDLDH","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by Francesca and posted at Under The Covers Book BlogI was a lot more excited going into this installment then how I feel now.  I blame this mostly on the fact that this second episode focuses a lot on Dakota Alvarez and the Senator.  From the very beginning we see Dakota as a spoiled brat who couldnt be bothered to really care about anyone but herself, and I really had no interest in her woes or feelings.  WHITE LIGHTNING goes deep into that.  A lot of the developments around town revolve around her from what we can see in this installment and I was just glad to see it coming to an end.  Yeah, Im not a Dakota fan.  Is it bad to wish that something bad would happen to her already so she gets a good dose of reality already?That being said, I still found the whole setup interesting and I cant wait for all the secrets to boil over and explode in everyones face!  Seems like theres no one there thats not hiding something that could potential ruin the life they are trying to build or to maintain.I think in the overall storyline, this one didnt quite provide enough advancement as I was hoping for but Im ready for the next.spacer","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GOPRYTDUTP27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014XJ059O#wasThisHelpful","R1GOPRYTDUTP27","A1JKGTL51HHTU1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JKGTL51HHTU1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this grille at BJs warehouse, was 69.99. I like that it has temperature controls.  The top adjusts to stay level to allow even grilling of thick meat. The cooking surfaces are easy to remove for hand cleaning or in the dish washer. A red light reminds you that it is on. An additional green light also indicates when it is up to the desired temperature. The grease dripping pan slides in from the side and works perfectly. You can use the ribbed side or the flat side of each surface as desired. So far I have only used it for meat and had good results.

"I bought the charcoal grey doormat. The mat is actually black with medium grey stripes. This mat is comprised of 3/4 inch tall plastic bristles which are basically flat blades that are formed to be bent in all directions. The mat is very light weight compared to all other types of mats that I have had. The backing is 1/16th inch thick, which is very thin and should be much thicker in my opinion. You can walk on it bare foot without any problem, but I would not like to stand on it bare foot for any length of time. I expect that it will knock more dirt and sand off of shoes than other mats that I have had. It will no doubt help keep the floors in my house cleaner and in better shape.

"I bought this mm1000 meter from one of the two big home improvement stores for 65 dollars. The first day I had it, I tried it to measure the ohms resistance of a resister. The reading was all over the place. I then held the two test leads together and it was still all over the place. After a while I realized that the test leads were not making good contact in the meter. The leads were pushed straight and fully in. I took the leads from my Greenlee clamp meter and tried the Greenlee leads in the Klein mm1000. The Klein meter works perfectly with the Greenlee leads. The Klein leads brand new are not any good. Soft vinyl that do not support the contact pin and possibly a cheap contact pin that goes into the meter. I probably will just buy the Greenlee leads and keep the meter.

"When I received this mower the rear wheel adjuster was bent over against the tire. I straightened that as best I could, it is very hard steel. Got it acceptable. The next problem was that one of the handle bar carriage bolts was missing and the other with the two knobs were loose in the box. Put one of my own bolts in till I get a proper replacement bolt. Poured in the bottle of oil and then filled the tank with gas. The mower started on the 2nd pull and ran fine. After a few minutes of running I shut it off and noticed a burn smell. Checked oil level again and on the full mark. Decided it must be paint or something on the muffler. So I started mowing the lawn and found that only the highest cut setting is usable for me. I find all of the other settings to low. The rear wheel cut height setting is strange as in the forward adjustment position the back wheels rub the mower deck. The rear adjuster is also lowest in the middle position and raises as you move it to the rear and also raises as you move it to the front. In the owners manual it states that the rear height adjuster moves in opposite directions according to which diameter wheels are on your mower. No numbers on the rear height settings, but the front wheels have numbers 1 to 6 and work as one would expect.  How strange is that. Makes no sense to me. Now after cutting the grass for about 50 minutes it started making a loud screeching sound from around the flywheel area. Shut if off and checked under the mower deck, all ok and no leaks. Restarted and after a few seconds the loud screeching sound was there again. I took it to a repair shop that is listed on the MTD web site for repair. I told the shop that my guess is that the safety brake is dragging and now worn out metal to metal against the inside of the flywheel. They said they may be able to get to it in about 2 weeks. I will update when I get it back and see if I can give it a better star rating or not. UPDATE 8/21/15: The diagnosis was that the recoil starter was rubbing the flywheel. The recoil has tabs that locate it above the flywheel and they were bent down some. Occurred during shipping? They straightened the tabs and it is fine now. So as it stands this mower runs great. Starts quickly and is average on gas usage. Has more than enough power mulching fairly thick tall grass. So I have bumped this review from 2 stars to 4 stars as I can't fault the mower for shipping damage. I hope this review helps","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6RO8CXDTYQZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2VVTY4#wasThisHelpful","R6RO8CXDTYQZH","A25TT44FXNV0F0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT44FXNV0F0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rats cannot resist eating this stuff. Be sure the rats have access to a lot of this, so they all get some before any get wise. Used bait stations to keep other animals from eating it. About five days latter, lots of dead rats. From a distance I sprayed the dead rats with spray nine to get rid of the fly's and fleas before bagging them for disposal. Don't want to come in contact with any rat disease carrying bugs. Wore disposable latex gloves.  Bagged and disposed of them before any other animals would be tempted to eat the dead rats.

"This was a mother's day gift for my mom. Right out of the box, this azalea is very full, nicely shaped and healthy. This was the first time I had tried buying a bush online. The pot came wrapped in a plastic bag and snugged closed  around the stem with a string. That with the roots held all of the dirt in place. The bush part is protected with a looped wicker like rod. A box that traps the pot from moving and covers the whole plant completes the packaging. I must say that I am impressed. I will update this review after it blooms. Update; 7/7/15 it is blooming. It has large beautiful blooms that so far are popping out a few at a time here and there on the bush. So far the first blooms still look good and while it has not fully covered it's self yet it looks great. It is possible that having been transplanted it only about 7 weeks ago has an effect on the bloom rate.

"Hello; this is a very sturdy, well made holder. The steel is heavy with full welds that are dressed. The inside diameter of the opening is 6 inch. So a 6 inch clay pot would be to small for this holder as it would pass right through the loop. Home Depot sells a clay pot at the store that fits this holder perfectly. The pot measures about 6 and 3/4 inch across the top.  The holder came with two screws which are fine, but I used deck screws for extra holding power. I mounted mine upside down from the picture and it is rock solid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VUNOL08QVMG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DI84B#wasThisHelpful","R2VUNOL08QVMG6","A25TT44FXNV0F0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT44FXNV0F0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is easy to set and modify the settings as needed. Turn the dial to each individual part of the program you wish to change and make that change. I bought a 6 foot hose to connect the timer to the faucet. Draped the long hose over an object close to the faucet and pull tied the hose in place. That way if you pull or trip over the hose it won't physically break the timer. So the timer hangs in a loop of hose and any load of pulling on the garden hose is handled by the pull tie.

"After all these years this is still the best rat trap. This trap has the metal bait holder, which has provided far more kills than the trap with the yellow plastic bait holder. I have tried most of the newer easy to set plastic traps. While the easy set traps are nice and safe to set, they don't have a strong enough spring. The easy set traps have weak springs that cause far to many escaped rats and still alive wounded rats. This M201 Victor metal pedal trap is the one to buy. Put out about ten traps, baited but NOT set to kill for the first three days and re bait them each day. That way they won't get trap shy. Then on the forth day bait and set all ten traps to kill. You will have a bunch of dead rats. Clean and Re bait for round two. Avoid rainy days as the rain drops set these traps off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCUI02XET0A1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004RAMW#wasThisHelpful","RCUI02XET0A1H","A25TT44FXNV0F0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TT44FXNV0F0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This trap never wounds a rat. Every rat has been fully inside of the trap and dead. I have had rats so big that they were squeezed in tight but also dead.

One bottle a day has definitely helped his energy, alertness and mobility. I have read that vitamin D-3 is almost certainly deficient in elderly people that do not get sun exposure. I think the D-3 in this drink is helping him think and have energy. He likes the taste and just getting the extra fluid in him is a help. He has only taken this 4 days, which is probably not long enough to credit the Glucosamine or the Chondroitin. It's probably the D-3 that has caused his rapid improvement.

"Bought exactly the same one last week at Lowes for 59 dollars and 95 cents. Probably sold out by now, as only some of the Lowes had only a few remaining on the shelf then. The main purpose for my review is to give you an idea of what the price should be. Great quality shiny material. Looks exactly as pictured. This is a 6 foot tall blow up, so when lit at night it really gets noticed. Has clear lights that are suspended inside. Black plastic fan in the base with legs that fold out. A big inflatable that is bright and looks great. Update 12/23/2014; Olaf blew a fuse in his power plug. I found that the reason was that one of his bulbs had blown (made in China bulbs). I replaced the fuse and he ran a while but then blew the replacement fuse.  One of the other bulbs had blown. I got a pack of 5 amp. fuses at Wal-Mart and 5 new C-7 clear bulbs. He has worked fine since then. I blame it on cheap bulbs, but be sure to move him gently when he is no inflated to save the bulbs.

"This shower head is very good at saving water. Another nice benefit is less hot water usage will lead to a lower utility bill. This shower makes a fairly loud hissing noise, but after a while you get used to it. The black swivel part is plastic and the silver portion is stainless steel. The only down side is that the spray is wide which hits the soap in the soap dish. I can angle it away partly toward the curtain and just be sure the curtain is always fully deployed.

"What I have found out by trial and error. I had a slow drain due to a build up in the galvanized drain pipes. The method that worked the best was to run hot water for awhile to warm the pipes. Then put 1 and a half to 2 gallons of hot water in a plastic bucket and add the lye to the bucket. Let dissolve and pour into the drain. Don't use any water in the house that will drain into that pipe. After some hours (I waited 4 hours), run some hot water to move the sludge along.

"I have a round dinette table in my kitchen with a light centered over it. I felt it was time for a lighting change to upgrade the look. In my opinion, new lighting is a relatively inexpensive way to improve the look of a room. At least compared to some other options, with one exception, that being new paint. This is a good looking light for a small area, since it is only 13 and 1/8th inch in diameter. This light has a single regular sized screw in socket. So you have the option of a screw in CFL, LED or a regular bulb.  My hardest decision is always the same, how long to make the chain. I settled on 18 links, which puts the bottom edge of the glass shade 34 inches below my 8 foot ceiling. Since it's over the table, head room is not an issue. Don't cut your wire to short, a mistake that I have made in the past. Leave enough extra wire to give you a few corrections to the chain length. If you like the look of this light but need something bigger, look at the Sea Gull 65942-962 which is 15 and 3/4th inch in diameter.

"This vise opens really wide, rated for use at 9 inches. Nothing is more disappointing than having a vice that won't open up wide enough for what you want to hold. The screw has a thick square thread and does not have much lost travel. The handle only moves about 1/8 of a turn before the jaw moves. The jaws meet up perfectly without any side or up and down play.  The play is controlled by a hardened triangular gib that can be adjusted by two hex set screws on the side of the vise. Being made from forged steel and welded together is a good indication of strength. The T shape of the movable jaw allows you to clamp some odd shaped items that bulker vises could not. The hardened pipe jaws are replaceable and can also be removed for more clearance if desired. The hardened jaw faces can also be replaced.

"The Wolves of Twin Moon Ranch is one of my favorite PNR shifter series. I have read all the books to date in the series and loved every one of them. If you are just starting out or just like the convenience of a collection, this is definitely the way to go.1. A very good standalone featuring Ty, son of the Twin Moon Alpha and Lana, daughter of an east coast Alpha. Unbeknownst to them, they belong to long term feuding families. Throw in a trouble making coyote shifter and rogue wolves and the recipe for disaster multiplies.2. Cody, the playboy youngest son of the Twin Moon Alpha, and Heather, a human teacher on the run from a vampire who fixated on her and killed her best friend, are featured. After crossing into Arizona, Heather takes a temporary teaching position at the ranch, planning to move on to California when it ends. Cody knows the green-eyed Heather is off limits, but can't stay away from her, while Heather finds her 'no more men' policy going up in flames when Cody is around. Cody believes his dreams of finding his own mate and happy ever after may be within reach. But a vampire is leaving a trail of murdered green-eyed women along the highway headed west toward Arizona, headed straight to Heather.3. All of the books in this series are great, but this is my favorite so far. The lead characters are likeable and engaging, while there is enough suspense that it kept me glued to my reader. Kyle has had a supporting role in previous books as the policeman changed into a shifter by a rogue wolf. Stephanie was forcibly changed by one of the Colorado pack and barely escaped being mated to him, running south to Arizona. When Kyle finds her in the desert, he recognizes a kindred soul, then recognizes her as his next door neighbor from an Army base ten years earlier when they were both teens. But they are both grown up now, different yet the same, and Stef is now the one in danger from the abusive male who wants to claim her, regardless of what she wants.

It is filled with humor, banter, double entendres, and innuendos and is a true standalone. Other books I enjoyed were:  Once Upon a Fiery Christmas,by Elianne Adams; Wolf in Exile, part 4.5, Bound, by Amber Ella Monroe; Bear in Heat, by Catherine Vale; Stranded with a Cajun Werewolf, Stormy Weather Book Five, by Selena Blake and Saving Christmas, by Rebekah R Ganiere. The other books in the collection are also good, and there is enough variety for most to find something to like. At the anthology price, it's a steal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B5E0OXJ7Q58Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NMZD2Y#wasThisHelpful","R1B5E0OXJ7Q58Z","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 212 page addition to the series is a potential standalone with an HEA, but it would be better if read from the first book, Heat, which gives background for the series. I've read the series from book one, recommend it and have it on my reread list.Bryce Connors: member of an MC at seventeen, Marine Corp deserter, drug addict, mercenary, recovering addict and corporate billionaire with a new identity at Archer Holdings.....  Peyton Rivers: daughter of alcoholic mother, killed mother's abusive boyfriend at seventeen, rescued from jail by a half brother she didn't know she had, works for the same billionaire brother, Logan, at Archer holdings, and secret ex girlfriend of Bryce....Bryce and Peyton were ready to take their relationship to the next level when she walked out on him without explanation a year earlier. Now they are at a corporate groundbreaking ceremony when a helicopter with men in black attacks and takes Logan.Blackriver, a mercenary group that works for the DOD, is behind the kidnapping and the Archer extended family wants Logan back. But he is a ghost, a man who doesn't exist and their friend Colonel Lawson can only provide Intel, not send in troops. Bryce volunteers to go after him, but so does Peyton, and when she's told no, she sneaks away to Istanbul anyway.  Their only option now is to work together with a Blackriver insider to rescue Logan, knowing they have to make their move soon or Logan won't survive Benson, the madman running Blackriver. A man who never lets grudges go unpunished.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELIO4FSWVYT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017N4X3JA#wasThisHelpful","RELIO4FSWVYT1","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the opener for the Soldiers of Fortune series, about a trio of Marines who walked away after an attack on their convoy in a small Afghanistan village. They make their way across the border into China and hire on as mercenaries in Africa, where they are recruited by William Archer, a billionaire who sees promise in them, not the broken men they've become. Archer gives them new identities, dries them out, and trains them to run his company.Reagan Archer first met Hudson Banks at her high school graduation party. She is angry at her father for being absent for much of her life, and resents the former soldiers he spends his time with, Hudson included. During college, however, she and Hudson become friends, a friendship that ends after her father's memorial service when they kiss and he walks away. Five years later, she has a degree in political science and is running for the state Senate.  After one of her largest contributors pulls their financial backing because of off script remarks she made in a speech, her campaign manager ambushes her at a political event with a new sponsor, one she swore she'd never take finances from, her father's company. And Hudson is the one who will be holding the purse strings and providing personal protection.

"This ninety page series opener is a quick read, a standalone and it has an HEA. The storyline takes place over several months, but actual contact between the h and H is minimal once he learns she is a virgin. That's because he has one hard and fast rule--he doesn't do virgins. And he would be able to actually stay away from her if only his mind and body were on board.Emerson is a college senior,  the daughter of a heroin addicted prostitute who abandoned her to the neonatal unit at the hospital where she was born. She grew up in the basement of a foster home, but has worked her way through college. Her roommate is her one and only friend, the person who makes sure she gets out and socializes one night a week. And it is on one of those nights out that she sees a tattooed man who looks like he benchpresses trucks, and then she watches him as he watches her watching him get off. They are both completely hooked, they just don't know it yet, and wouldn't admit it if they did. Because he's a SEAL who doesn't do relationships and she's not like any woman he's met before.

"I received an ARC of this anthology from one of the authors in return for an honest review. Maker, by Holley Trent, is book five of the Norseton Wolves series and a standalone with an HEA. It is different from previous books in the series in that Graciella is not one of the four females who answered the mating call put out by Adam, Alpha of the Norseton pack. She is the younger sister of one of them and was brought to Norseton to save her from a potentially abusive arranged marriage. Likewise, Finn is the brother of another of the four women. He had been cast out of his pack and was on his own for years before being brought in to Norseton. These two are strongly attracted to each other, but are trying to honor Graciella's sister's desire to give her time and freedom before mating. Finn wants to be accepted by his new pack and to honor family wishes, but where he attempts to be an immovable object, Graciella is an irresistible attraction.This is an exceptionally good story and there are others in this collection I know will be as well. I'm looking forward to reading them all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QTQVN9VTWVF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160D014K#wasThisHelpful","R1QTQVN9VTWVF8","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good standalone contemporary romance from an author that's new to me. She writes complex, likable characters in a small town setting, with a dash of suspense thrown in. She is an author I will explore further.Harper leaves everything behind when she catches her live-in boyfriend and boss in bed with someone else, running out the door without even her purse or cell phone. She heads for a friend's house, but runs out of gas in the parking lot of a quaint small town bar on the way, just in time to see a man beating a much smaller woman. Harper tries to stop him and is punched in the face, waking up to the face of the most handsome man she has ever seen.Luke came by the bar to make sure Josie, his sister, is safe closing up. He arrives as a blonde  jumps on the back of a big, mean, abusive drunk in the parking lot. When the drunk turns on her, Luke knocks him out, and takes her inside to check out her injuries. Josie talks to Harper, learns she is stranded and comes up with a novel idea to help both Harper and Luke, whose parents are playing matchmaker for him. He has a short term job opening and Harper needs a job. And a place to stay, which he also has. And since he's being deployed in a month, they can add a short term romance to appease the parents to the mix.

"One of the many things I love about Erin Kellison's books is the unpredictability. She incorporates multi dimensional characters into a complex storyline, weaving in suspense, romance, impossible odds and strong MC's who steadfastly go after what they want. The author of the Reveler series has another winner in the Shadow Series and to me, this book is one of her best.Death has been searching for Kathleen since she died while giving birth to their daughter, Talia. She isn't in Heaven, which leaves Hell, and he's furious that she would be punished for his crime. So he has abandoned his duties as the Grim Reaper and has built a gate to Hell with a hammer borrowed from an angel. As he reaches completion, he hears footsteps running outside and perceives a woman being pursued by two thugs. Then he sees the Fate Moira clip the woman's lifeline, consigning her to death.Layla grew up in the foster care system, labeled as ""different"", ""special needs"", and on medication for paranoid schizophrenia because of the things she sees. She now works for the Global Insight, an online journal, where she is writing an investigative  series on the Segue Institute and wraiths. When she trespasses onto Segue property to get pictures of Talia Thorne, Adam Thorne's mysterious half fae wife, Layla is escorted back home, but is given a lead by a disgruntled resident. She follows it to a warehouse listed as belonging to Adam Thorne, but is chased and attacked by two thugs intent on raping her. She escapes and enters the warehouse, which contains an metal gate that compels her to open it. A stranger instantly recloses it as something surges through. The man keeps calling her Kathleen, even after she gives him her name and tells him why she's there.  She is enticed into going with him back to Segue when he tells her he can get her in to see Talia, who he claims is her daughter. And even as more unusual things happen, Layla is slow to believe the things she sees, much less what she's told, because of her history. But as events accumulate, she realizes there are other worlds besides Mortality, Death has his limits and that she is living on borrowed time, especially with a devil, Fate and a group of angels after her.

"This is a series that started out great and has somehow gotten better with each book. In Cry Wolf, Diesel has gone to Las Vegas to meet with the Alpha there, a wolf of power who has refused his calls. He needs a way into the pack's casino and the Alpha' s office and is scouting the back alley when a sultry voice calls to him, asking if he has a light. A few cliched rounds later, they are struggling to make it to her suite before tearing each other's clothes off.Willow is a country singing star at the end of a Vegas booking and trying to find her inner muse to write new music for an upcoming album. She goes out back after her last set of the night and sees a man built like a bodyguard walking toward her. On impulse she calls out to him, and in the banter and attraction that follows, she has the feeling there is something familiar about him. She wakes the next morning to an empty bed and a missing room key card, but over the next week can't get him out of her head. So she takes the band's old van on a trip to Angels Rest, a place Diesel described to her. Because it's hunting season she can't find a room there.  But Diesel finds her at a local diner and takes her to Maddie's. During introductions they learn each other's given names and realize they know each other from when they were seven, a time when he spent two weeks with his cousin then had to leave. But not before making a blood oath that they would find each other again, a bond that marked her and placed a sleeping wolf inside her, waiting. A bond and sleeping wolf she knows nothing about, any more than she knows about the wolf inside the man she is falling for.

This has been a great series and I'm looking forward to the next spinoff series featuring the wolves.After losing her job and her boyfriend, Sloan decided to expand the partial Pacific Crest Trail hike she had planned for the future to the full Canada to Mexico length and to go now. Two and a half months later she has nearly reached a waypoint in Cascadia, the Double Moon Ranch, where she is booked for a couple of days to clean-up and rest. But before she gets there she glimpses a flash of blue back in the trees, something out of place. When she investigates, she discovers an unconscious young man with a dart in his neck. At her screams for help, a naked man appears and gives her directions to the ranch before picking the unconscious man up and trotting ahead of her to the ranch. As she thinks on the oddity of a naked man in the forest, though, she remembers where she is and realizes he must be a shifter.  An ambulance is called and the police's questions are answered. But just as one puzzle is resolved, another presents itself. Sloane becomes the primary suspect in the attempted homicide, and only the resources of the shifters she's just met can help her.Copy received in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DWUOUNFJA7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017OGGY7K#wasThisHelpful","R13DWUOUNFJA7C","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unlike the first two women, Hannah has refused to accept Sean as her mate, even after being changed into a shifter herself, condemning Sean to the rest of his life in cougar form. A month after the curse kicks in, however, Hannah strikes a bargain with the goddess. If she finds a replacement for herself as his mate, both she and Sean will be free of each other and the curse. All she has to do is find someone worthy, a job that becomes more difficult with each day as her feelings for him grow and her new roll as Avenger presents itself.This is an exciting and captivating series by one of my favorite authors.

Other books were a bonus.*Bump in the Night, by Elianne Adams.

Masterson, the sired son of the ancient vampire Master, is very old school, powerful and he takes what he wants. He has been looking for a special type of woman for 600 years, since the death of his donor Peaches at the hands of his sire. Each day is the same for him, looking for a human whose blood is untainted, who will submit without the use of his thrall, one that he will keep rather than kill. Then he visits a coffee shop outside his usual haunts and scents a woman who smells like plums with an undertone of death, a beautiful woman who flirts with him and isn't afraid of him. One he can't resist.

She comes from a long line of she wolves with a special ability, one that is highly coveted for it's rarity and one she has kept secret to maintain her freedom and independence. But Zach triggers something she has never felt toward an alpha male and Zach finds he is also drawn to the female he has been ordered to keep the other males away from. Neither knows about the terms of her trade or the plans the TMR Alpha has for Rae that could cost Zach his life.

The conclave magistrates allowed her to return to work as a marshall, but must approve cases before she takes them.  Not being a rule follower, it isn't long before she's on suspension and vacationing in Florida with her roommate Mai. There are those in Faerie who don't want a half breed princess on the throne, though, and they have a long reach into the human realm.  Florida turns out to be a convenient location for them as well, since it is one of the homes of an ancient fae, a collector of death bringers like Thierry.

They have been sent by the Celts to assist in sorting out the dark shifters aided by the Battle Crow, the Morrigan. But they have come from the past, a past where dragons and nudity were not an issue. So the first order of business is.....shopping.If you've read the prequel to the series, Highland Secrets, the name Jonathan will be familiar, and this is that Jonathan. But things are different than his parents  had hoped and Jonathan is angry and resentful about being abandoned at a young age. This book puts paid to many of his questions about his parentage, while leaving other issues unresolved. But for this HEA junkie it ends fairly well, with lots of material left for the next book.  So I'm now on to Dragon's Dare.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R327A4R6DLV1Q2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HQE9N0#wasThisHelpful","R327A4R6DLV1Q2","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading To Love a Highland Dragon, which I loved, in the anthology Flight of Dragons, I purchased this book, it's prequel. It is every bit as good, if not better. Both books can standalone and while this one doesn't end with a HEA, it has a plan and hope for getting there. When dealing with the Celtic pantheon, that may be better than the norm.  But for those of us with a need for closure, it leaves the door to disaster open a little too much. Being an ever hopeful romantic, however, I've purchased book three and am looking forward to seeing more of Lachlan and Maggie from book two, and to meeting Jonathan, the hope for the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E70LA7EN6BOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KAXWU6#wasThisHelpful","R3E70LA7EN6BOD","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Things have changed in the town of Glen Vine, Michigan. Because of a mad wolf shifter, there are eight new werewolves in town, and someone is shooting at them.Charlotte Wills is a college student who was dumped and stranded by her ex-boyfriend, resulting in her being attacked and bitten by a wolf. She is in the town's coffee shop when she hears two men talking about going after the wolves that kept them awake howling the night before. Her wolf begins to rise and she runs out of the shop and down the street, right into a brick wall of solid muscle known as the sheriff, another recently turned wolf. Kane Martin is known for his one night stands with waif thin women with augmented features. But there is something about Charlotte bowling him over that catches his attention. And that's her scent.

"Hell Squad is a remarkably fresh and riviting series. Each new release brings additional elements to the story and further develops characters introduced in earlier books. To fully appreciate the series, it needs to be read from the beginning.Noah Kim is brilliant, he even has a sign on the computer lab door that says ""Shhhh..genius at work"". And to former naval intelligence officer, Laura Bladon, or ""Captain Dragon"", as he calls her, he is a ""wayward, arrogant, tech genius"". Both had very different lives before the alien Gizzida invasion that obliterated all the major cities on the planet. But like the other survivors at the Blue Mountain Base, they have learned to adapt.

"I love this series and this book is an excellent addition to it. It has strong lead characters who obviously love each other very much, but are fighting against the odds.Tina, the oldest daughter of the Alpha of Twin Moon Ranch has been in love with Ricardo Rivera since they were teens on adjoining central Arizona Ranches. He left for college, then a career in pro baseball, but returned to visit and to ask her to join him. She turned him down, and will always have to turn him down, because he is human, forbidden. What she doesn't know is that Rick recently moved back after a career ending injury to take over as manager of the neighboring ranch and has given himself twenty days to win her over, and another twenty after that if he needs them, until she agrees to be his. But Atsa, Alpha of the coyote shifters, has brought word of an incursion into the Bitterroot Valley by a hellhound. And it will take the entire Twin Moon Ranch working together if they are to have any chance of defeating the demon, and even then there are still no guarantees, increasing the odds against the fated, but star crossed, mates.Copy received in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RNPTOEYN4UZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015UPORGC#wasThisHelpful","R2RNPTOEYN4UZT","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Made up of stories by best selling and emerging authors, this collection is a great value. I found more than one new (to me) author that I will be exploring further, one of whom took my top spot for this book.1. Releasing Her Dragon, by Elianne Adam's, a standalone with an HEA.2. Dragon Reborn, by LC Alleyne. A standalone with an HEA.3. The Dragon's Stolen Bride, by Sadie Haller. A historical standalone with an HEA and a meddling ghost.4. Ice, by Skye Jones. A great menage standalone with a tough MMA cage fighting latent she dragon, the two male dragons who find her and an HEA.5. Forged in Fire, Celtic Dragons, Book One, by Zara Keane. Set in 2158 in a post civil war Ireland, this story is part of a trilogy.6. To Love a Highland Dragon, Dragon Lore, Book One,  by Ann Gimpel. A great time traveling trilogy opener. Highland Secrets is the prequel.7. Demons' Captive, Demons and Dragons, Book One, by Evanne Lorraine. Set in the galactic year 4416 in the Orion Galaxy, this menage is my favorite story in the collection and a great series opener.8. Blue Moon Dragon, by Shelly Munro.9. A Viking's Need, Vikings in Space, Book Three, by Zoe York. A standalone with an HEA between a monk and a woman who loves the natural dragons on his planet.10.

"I read this riveting story in the Flight of Dragons anthology and loved it!  It was my favorite of all of them.  The author provides great character development, world building, and the component that eludes many authors, an emotional hook. Evanne Lorraine is a new author to me, but I will definitely be reading more of her work.A test tube creation, Zaynah has been conditioned from before birth to obey Prado, the Emperor of the Orion Galaxy. At age 25, she is one of his assassins, though she's the smallest and the weakest. So she is surprised when he tells her she is going on a solo mission to infiltrate a rebel mining colony and kill its leaders. But as her space craft nears her target, she is caught in a meteor storm and her craft's systems fail, rendering her injured and near death when a tractor beam pulls her into port.Diablo and his brother, Gunn, are fire demons and  fugitives, falsely accused of murdering their brothers, a crime that was actually  carried out by Prado. They have taken over the empire's mining operation that supplies fuel to the empire and have  forged alliances against Prado, set on avenging their brothers. Because they have interrupted the supply of fuel to the empire for over a year, they expect some kind of retaliation, but not a lone spacecraft piloted by one small woman. One that triggers the mating frenzy in both of them. One that bears the marks of the Emperor's elite assassins, but has no memory of anything before waking in their clinic.Even before she regains full consciousness, Zaynah registers she is in the presence of demons, but is strongly attracted to them in spite of her training.  And when she realizes the attraction is there on their side as well, then lust becomes mating frenzy. A perfect time for the empire to attack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TMH1JB6N6R7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5C486C#wasThisHelpful","R1TMH1JB6N6R7G","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wacky opener to the new Celebrity Bears Series by Kim Fox, author of the Smoke Jumpers Werebear series. A quick read, it is an easy way to lighten up a day, because it doesn't take anything too seriously. If the next book is anything like this one, Kim will have another winning series on her hands.Mason Maloney is an aging action star who's lost his A-lister status, no longer pulling in prime roles. His bear has started pushing him toward finding a mate and settling down. Little does he know it would be a community college film graduate, Joni Meyer, working on set in 'recycling' who would snag his bear's attention.

"I love Roxie Noir' s take on shifters who have come out and are coexisting, for the most part, with humans and each other. This story takes place in the shifter state of Cascadia, carved out when shifters went public. There are questions left unanswered at the end, a possible conspiracy?  Maybe those will be answered in a later book.  Copy was received in return for an honest review.Charlie, an FBI agent working on a task force with the Dept of Fish and Wildlife, has been assigned to capture or kill a feral grizzly shifter who is believed to have killed two wolf shifters. She stalks him until she gets the perfect shot to tranq him, but before she can fire she is attacked from behind by two wolves.  Kade, not feral at all, chases the wolves away and takes her back to the cabin he shares with Daniel, his mate and they begin the long process of nursing her back to health. In the days to come, after she's able to think clearly again, Charlie begins to question information the task force based their decisions on.

Her father left when she was young, her mother makes her feel she isn't good enough and she has no close friends. But Tori has a dream of studying apex predators and has been accepted to assist a professor for a year in the Serengeti while they track collared lions and she works on her PhD dissertation.Heath Sellers has been hired as their guide. He comes highly recommended, but his experience has come with a price and a big secret. He is a former very successful big game trophy guide to the rich who was cursed three years earlier to become a lion shifter after he was involved in the killing of a lion shifter in lion form.

Because of security concerns, she has never been allowed off planet, so when her step-brother offers to take her for a quick space ride she rebels and accepts. But before they can return, a slavers ship appears and she is told to escape in a capsule programmed to return to Terrea.

"I first read Linda Barlow in an anthology and found this book as I explored her other books. It is a great standalone with an HEA, though the two books at the end preceed it chronologically and provide background for Jess, the female lead.Jess, a multiform shifter with Scottish mother and American father, has returned to her grandfather's ranch in Montana from Scotland to get away from her mother's attempts to marry her off to Cameron, another multiform shifter and her second cousin. She soon learns, however, that her grandfather, a wolf shifter, has been keeping secrets when they are involved in an accident and he is  hospitalized.  Before he dies, he alludes to debts and  extracts a promise from her not to contest his will.Cade is Tom's Alpha and long time friend. Jess remembers him from her childhood as the black sheep of his family. His father was Alpha and his older brother was expected to follow as Alpha. But after their deaths, Cade was chosen to lead his pack, winning over another contender, Brandon. Cade's ranch adjoins Tom's and he has made an offer to buy Tom's land. Tom also gains his promise not to contest his will.When Tom's will is read, both Cade and Jess are present, both stunned. Tom has left his ranch and home to both of them. But to claim it, they will have to marry and stay married for six months. Otherwise the ranch will be sold to a land developer and the proceeds will be donated. Both promised to follow his wishes, never expecting to be snared in an arranged marriage. For Jess it's out of the frying pan and into the fire. For Cade it a win win-sex with an end date.

It follows Travis as he backpacks through the Sierras, not realizing when he sets out that he has been bitten and turned without his knowledge or consent by a female cougar shifter during a brief hook up. He encounters other shifters on the trail, bear and wolf, with mixed results, getting a brief intro to shifter 101. Then he meets Becka, a human park ranger working a remote camp for the winter, keeping track of snow depths and trying to get on full time for a summer position. He is instantly attracted, but knows natural cougars are loners, just like the shifter that turned him,  and he doesn't want to treat her badly by leaving, an inevitability.

It has made my reread and recommend lists and this book is an excellent addition to the series.Jameson is a born wolf and a strong member of the Feral Breed MC. A year earlier he found his mate lying among the dead bodies at a massacre and has dreamed of her and grieved her loss ever since.Aoife is an archer, necromancer and deadtalker who helps spirits transition into the afterlife. Overcome by the sheer number of new spirits, she was in a trance between worlds when Jameson found her and thought she was dead.

But when she and Percy, a childhood friend and foreteller, travel to a lighthouse near Merriweather Fields to help witches under attack, she sees a man she thought existed only in her mind. Guided by Percy, her arrows bring down wolves attacking a coven and a man distracted when he sees her, his shock evident.Jameson is confused and temporarily immobilized when he sees the woman he believed dead, opening him to an attack by the enemy.  But when he falls, she comes to his defense, felling wolves with arrows that shouldn't be able to permanently stop them, but do.After the battle ends, it isn't over, though, because the nearby  Merriweather Fields is under siege and Blaze has been challenged by a shifter named King for the presidency of the NALB.

Call of the Dragon, book one in the Return to Avalore series is also quite good. I haven't yet read Complication, from the Shifters Forever After series, by Elle Thorne, but am intrigued by the excerpt and will be watching for it.

In the first, a daughter refuses to believe her father's death was a suicide. No one will take her seriously, though, until she calls the protectors and an attempt is made on her life at the first meeting with her assigned guardian. In Book Two, an actress witnesses the murder of her agent and long time boyfriend, barely escaping with her life. But the police treat her more as a suspect than a witness, and she calls the protectors.  Book Three is my favorite of the set, flowing more seamlessly than the previous two.

And while each of the books can easily standalone and have their own HEA, they are better when read in order because of background and context. I highly recommend this book and the series and will be watching impatiently for book four.The third Immortal brother to be freed by the goddess Weysa from eternal punishment (in his case from burning like a star from the inside out for daring to drink from the fount of life without permission), is in the process of conquering the port city of Kriza in Weysa's name when the story begins. After the city falls, he encounters a naked woman, Jileana, near the beach where he goes each night to burn. Jileana looks nothing like the Krizians, intrigues Jaykun enough to take her back to the castle, and  saves him from an assassin's blade the next morning. He is completely smitten and his brothers are suspicious, but Jileana has asked for three days with him before she has to return home to Serenity, a city on an island concealed by perpetual storms. Jaykun has agreed, but at the end of their time together, he realizes three days isn't enough and impulsively begins a forbidden journey that will change all their lives.Copy received in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38N43322TAZKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055339343X#wasThisHelpful","R38N43322TAZKO","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Containing the first three books of the Blood Rose Series, this set is a bargain. After reading Embrace the Dark in the Dark and Dangerous anthology, and the first two shorts from the Blood Rose Tales, I was eager to read Ethan's story in Embrace the Magic. Like the other mastyr vampires, Ethan is very alpha and totally dedicated to protecting his realm from the deadly Invictus. Guilt and betrayal keep him from believing that he will ever bond with a Blood Rose, if he even finds one.  Samantha is a graduate student and jewelry maker in Shreveport. As part of a class assignment she is interviewing 'others' in a bar that caters to them. Then Ethan enters the bar and everything stops. Even the vampires who have been pestering her fade away into the crowd. When he sees Samantha, Ethan is struck by several things: she is a Blood Rose, she is a very powerful part fae, and she has no idea that she is either. Belatedly realizing Samantha is in grave danger from a rogue mastyr, Ry, Ethan takes her to his home in the realm and calls for assistance from the strongest fae he knows to help Samantha learn of her heritage and abilities.In the third book in the Blood Rose Series, Quinlan is in pursuit of a new conquest. Batya is an artist in Lebanon, Tennessee, and mentor and healor to other expats in the area.  Since meeting Batya two months earlier, Quinlan has pursued her relentlessly and is outside her shop when the ancient fae and two supersized Invictus attack. Once Quinlan and Batya realize Batya's assistant was the intended target, and why, they join forces to get her to safety. But of course, nothing simple is ever easy.This book, like the two before it, is beautifully written. The novellas in the series are compelling and impossible to put down.  And while they, along with the Blood Rose Tales shorts, can be read as stand alones, they are much better read in order within the series.  I highly recommend the series and this set is a great way to begin","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QC0BY07XJSG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013IHKGAA#wasThisHelpful","R1QC0BY07XJSG6","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved this book and the way Holley Trent has of writing complex relationships that don't automatically go to an HEA.  She is one of the few authors who is able to  convey emotional highs and lows, strengths and fears, miscommunications and epiphanies that make her characters real and likable and her storyline captivating. This standalone is the first book I've read in the series, but I'll definitely be reading the rest.Megan Scott Coffman Rozhkov is tired of being ""Poor Meg"", the ex-wife of the cheating, emotionally abusive rock star ""Tight Spike"" Coffman. Which is why she has entered into an arranged marriage with one of her college circle of friends. Sergei ""Seth"" Rozhkov is a Russian born, US educated astrophysicist/aerospace engineer raised by his Romani grandmother.  He's reached a stage in his life where he believes he will never have a wife and family. Erica, a mutual friend and matchmaker, sees something in both Meg and Seth that she believes makes them a good match and convinces Seth to go along with the marriage.  But their agreement calls for only a brief marriage, a separation and an end date. And while they find there are some things they are very good at, communication isn't one of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGVWJYJ1XD5NY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF7ZF7M#wasThisHelpful","RGVWJYJ1XD5NY","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Windswept, Serendipity Adventure Romance, Book 3, by Anna Lowe. A standalone with an HEA.This latest book in the Serendipity series is in my opinion the best in series to date. It is set in the small southern Caribbean island of Bonaire, known for it's pristine water and premier scuba diving. Mia Whitman and her sister, Melanie, are taking their turn sailing Serendipity, the 32' sailboat left to them and their cousins by their grandfather so they could 'reconnect'. Mia has taken a temporary job as a scuba instructor on the island and is shocked when one of the divers on the excursion is her ex, Ryan Hayes, a former SEAL and current NYPD diver. He says he has followed her to apologize for his part in a betrayal that ripped them apart weeks earlier. But Mia is on a mission to forget, not forgive, until she witnesses a crime and becomes the target of a rich and powerful consortium.

"Roth: Hell Squad, Book 5, by Anna Hackett.It's been a year and a half since the alien invasion of Earth and a small force of survivors are fighting back from a hidden military installation outside Sydney, Australia. Avery Stillman, a Coalition Central Intelligence Agency agent on the fast track to the top, spearheaded negotiations with the alien Gizzida before being betrayed by a politician on the team. She was handed over to the aliens and placed by them into a genesis tank to change her into an alien raptor. A year later she was pulled from the tank by Roth Masters, leader of Squad Nine from Blue Mountain Base. She has huge holes in her memory and Roth is pushing her hard to remember anything that will help in the fight against the invaders, but his incessant interrogations haven't shaken anything loose. So, just as Roth realizes she really doesn't remember and that he is beginning to care for her,  Avery elects to go through a dangerous memory retrieval procedure.  Success could mean an increased chance of survival for the base's inhabitants, but the procedure could also leave her brain damaged or worse, take her life. Regaining her memory could also clear her to return to active duty and to join the  search for the man who betrayed her and the billions who died because of his cowardice. Roth doesn't like the risk, but is determined to give her something he provides his teammates everyday --backup.Copy received in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W1G60SE0T4PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015P4QDVU#wasThisHelpful","R2W1G60SE0T4PC","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gabe: Hell Squad, Book Three, by Anna Hackett, 211 pages. Set in a post alien apocalyptic Sydney, Australia, the books in this series can standalone, with their own HEA, but would be better read in sequence. They are addictive and I can't wait to read the next book, Reed.The very scary Gabe Jackson has been in a tailspin since dinosaur like alien raptors killed his twin brother on a mission three months earlier. He is obsessed with killing as many of the aliens as he can, without regard to his own safety, putting himself in the doghouse with the leader of Hell Squad, Marcus. The only bright spot in Gabe's world now is Dr. Emerson Green, Blue Mountain Base's head of medical services.Emerson has been fighting her own nightmares since being captured and beaten by a raptor on a recent mission to rescue  human survivors held in a lab by the aliens. The bright spots in her sleepless nights are when a silent Gabe slips into her locked room.  Emerson wants more, wants a real relationship, but Gabe is certain she deserves someone better than a genetically altered soldier with an absence of feelings and words.  In this there is no middle ground, especially in a world where the Gizida reign, and each mission could be their last.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVO5FAUPKXN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAQU2WQ#wasThisHelpful","R3PVO5FAUPKXN5","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Blood Flame, The Flame Series #1, 182 pages, standalone series opener with an HEA.This is a fantastic series opener in the vein of the Blood Rose and Guardian series, but set in Phoenix, or a version of Phoenix. Connor is an Officer with the Border Patrol, an agency that patrols the Five Bridges area, which separates the five paranormal territories from each other and from Phoenix. Ten years earlier Connor's wife died suddenly and in his grief he took the drug Blood Flame, not realizing it was laced with Alter, a serum that changed him into a vampire. While he is a moral man in an agency on the take from drug and sex lords, he also has done things he regrets. And since seeing Iris in action as a Tribunal Public Safety Officer, he has become obsessed with the witch, watching her from the shadows, even though he knows that as a witch she is his mortal enemy.Iris and her sister were kidnapped and given Blood Flame laced with witch serum nine years earlier. Iris was abandoned by her captors, but Violet was forced into slavery and killed by a group of vampires high on Flame. Iris has sensed Connor' s presence as he studies her, and she is likewise interested in him, but wary. Then they are each called out on a reported drug runner, then on a homicide of a TPS witch and border patrol officer.  And it quickly becomes obvious someone is setting Connor and Iris up to die as well, unless they find a way to work together.Copy received in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTPSAD6C7D6I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147RGTJW#wasThisHelpful","RTPSAD6C7D6I7","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! What a ride. The story begins with the Phoenix brothers on a treasure hunt when they are tased and taken captive by Galactic Institute of Historical Preservation agents. Niklas Phoenix, an astro-archeologist and former employee of the Institute, is at first furious, then bewildered when the encounter turns into a job offer. Avril, a young Institute director, wants Nik as part of an expedition she has put together to Dark Earth, a planet destroyed by nuclear war and still highly radioactive. New technology and medical advances will allow the treasure hunters to enter targeted sites to look for treasures left behind by evacuees before the apocalypse. He refuses the offer, but is awakened that night by an intruder who informs him she has been hired for the expedition and that a rare manuscript will be available to the hunters.Nera Darc, a beautiful, ruthless and deadly treasure hunter has intrigued Nik for most of the series. So, of course he calls Avril and accepts her offer, much to the dismay of his brothers.I loved this story. It has been a long wait for Nik and Nera to finally come together, and it's as exciting as it is romantic. There are Institute baddies, treasure hunter baddies, mutant jungle cats, rampaging zombies, a sex slave and surprise characters. Through it all, Nik and Nera hold steady, watching each other's backs as they face off against one surprise after another. But they are up against increasingly overwhelming odds, even for someone with Nera's skill set and Nik's intelligence. For me, this is the best book in the series to date.ARC received in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FT5FIMDT7VO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01540DXZO#wasThisHelpful","R1FT5FIMDT7VO7","A1RCVV077UAKKV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RCVV077UAKKV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In the intro, she recommends reading Wolf Claim first, which provides background for Brett, but all of the Willow Bend books are exceptional, so that is no hardship.

Luc Danes is a lone wolf who was tracking a strange scent when hit, resulting in two broken legs, a broken arm, a skull fracture and week long coma. He needs to get out of the hospital immediately to maintain his human form, makes arrangements for an AMA discharge and hires the human Colby to drive him to his former pack in Westchester County, NY.  By the time they arrive at the remote destination, Luc is unconscious and Colby is looking for a phone to call for an ambulance. That's when Brett Dalton, Alpha of the Hudson River Pack, finds her in his kitchen with his landline in hand, smelling of Luc.

"Nathan Kamchatka is the enforcer for the North Star clan's Alpha, Brock, who is traditional, a separatist, and brutal when he believes he needs to be.  They were best friends growing up and Nathan fell into the role when Brock became Alpha.  Because of the things he has done, Nathan doesn't think he will ever have a mate, because he doesn't deserve one  Then Brock orders him to help with security at a bethrothal ceremony between a member of their clan and the Yukon City Alpha's daughter, an alliance Brock badly wants.  But Nathan is shocked when he sees the bride to be, Leah Whitehorse, because he feels things he thought were myth.  If he didn't know better, he'd think she was his mate.Leah hadn't met Ian before the betrothal ceremony, but her father made the arrangements and told her Ian is her mate.  She wonders why he doesn't make her feel the way Nathan does, though.  And as much as she tries to follow her father's orders, all she can think about is Nathan.This is a great addition to the North Star Shifters.

"I'm loving the look I get with Garnier Curl Stretch Loosening Pudding. Garnier is a quality manufacturer of affordable hair care products. I believe that everyone with curly hair should give this excellent product a try.I like using Garnier Curl Stretch to get the 'surfer dude' look my wife likes. Keep in mind that as a man, I have relatively long hair (not quite to my shoulders) but probably shorter than most women; so I get a lot of style from using just a small amount of Curl Stretch. All I do is apply Curl Stretch to towel-dry hair and massage in.

"I've been a satisfied Vega Sport customer for several years and very pleased to see its new Performance Protein is better than ever. Vega Sport is the leader in plant-based performance supplements using nothing but ingredients of high integrity.

I don't want to consume a lot of red meat so I need an alternative protein source. Vega Sport is exactly what I need. It's a plant-based protein that is free of glutens and soy (a food I need to avoid because I have thyroid issues). Plus there are amino acids and glutamine to provide a complete solution that aids in muscle repair and recovery. For me, it doesn't get any better than this.I also like the vanilla flavor.

"The Happiness Industry by William Davies offers a thoughtful, passionate and powerful critique of the capitalist state.  Mr. Davies is a U.K.-based educator and social critic who spent five years writing this exceptionally well-researched book.  I believe that everyone alarmed by the intrusions of capital into our personal psyches will be empowered by this eye-opening book.Mr. Davies believes that Jeremy Benthams conceptualization of money as a proximate measure of happiness set the stage for psychology and capitalism.  The subsequent rise of consumerism has eviscerated the political subject: labor is endured merely to gain the money necessary for purchasing happiness.  Mr. Davies talks about how an increasingly sophisticated marketing industry that is maniacally focused on surveillance, manipulation and profit.Mr. Davies contends that decades of Thatcher-style individualism has produced several generations of insecure workers who have internalized their precarious, impoverished circumstances. The pharmaceutical industry has gained enormously as the powerless seek relief from their depression through medication. An important takeaway from the author's lesson is that competitiveness and the management of happiness go hand in hand.Mr. Davies discusses the exploitation of the individuals social capital for marketing purposes, which he believes is steadily eroding personal friendships and altruism. Problematically, the enormous quantity of data captured by government and industry has allowed the powerful to manipulate individuals with precision; while few of us are capable of fully understanding the invidious media that feeds upon us.  Mr. Davies believes people can fight back only when it is admitted that unhappiness is the product of a coercive capitalist culture that has succeeded in beating down the working class. In fact, the author argues that the relative happiness of workers in employee-owned companies suggests that economic and political rights are keys to achieving real happiness.I highly recommend this excellent book to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PBRRQQAKBNMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PCKYU#wasThisHelpful","R1PBRRQQAKBNMN","A2F6NONFUDB6UK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F6NONFUDB6UK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Tickle"" by Opus Five is a terrific straight-ahead jazz album comprised of all-original tunes.  The members of Opus Five are among the very best musicians active in the NYC jazz scene today: Seamus Blake on saxophone, Alex Sipiagin on trumpet, David Kikoski on piano, Boris Kozlov on bass and Donald Edwards on drums.What makes this project special is the rapport these five virtuoso musicians have developed due to their frequent collaborations on the Criss Cross Jazz label. In fact, ""Tickle"" is the fourth collaboration by Opus Five to appear on the label.  Although any one of these musicians is more than capable of riffing for minutes on end, you won't find any egos run amok here. Instead, what you'll find are songs that stretch out just enough to allow each artist time to make their individual statements; and then step aside to allow their band mates to build on their creativity.To my ears, the music on this disc proves that the Opus Five collective has grown stronger with time. All five contribute at least one song to the project - and there are no weaknesses.  The collegiality, respect and professionalism that exists within this group allows for nothing but first-class material to make the cut.""Silver Pockets"" cleverly plays homage to a Horace Silver riff, setting up a series of tasty improvisations in the pocket. ""Tickle"" is a dynamic tune kick-started by Edwards and featuring Sipiagin's signature fiery trumpet stylings. ""New Old Ballad"" is setup very nicely with Kikoski's magnificent piano and followed up with soulful, thoughtful statements from Blake, Sipiagin and Kozlov.  ""Five Corners"" showcases the five player's telepathy, instincts and good taste to produce an enjoyable upbeat jazz tune.  ""Crack to the Crevice"" gets the funk out with some great playing by Kikoski among others. ""Equilibrium"" is yet another fine example of how well the players support and balance each other to achieve a kind of timeless, classic jazz sublimity.  ""Murzake"" is a classic wine-and-roses tune that surely belongs on a romance playlist.I highly recommend ""Tickle"" to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17WEE02VQPDPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014FXU5Q6#wasThisHelpful","R17WEE02VQPDPV","A2F6NONFUDB6UK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F6NONFUDB6UK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Philosophy and the Idea of Communism"" is a transcript of a conversation recorded on March 23-24, 2012.  The subject is the renowned French philosopher Alain Badiou who was interviewed by Peter Engelmann.  This intellectually challenging short book has moments of value but suffers for being far too esoteric.The book has two chapters.  Chapter one is the interview from March 23rd.  Badiou and Engelmann muse about various fine points made by Hegel, Kierkegaard, Lacan, Nietsche, Sartre and other philosophers. While I suppose that this content might be most interesting to philosophy students, as a general interest reader I found value on several points. For example, Badiou's perspective on ""the death of God"" in the 1960s as a harbinger of late capitalism and its emerging nihilism was helpful to me..Chapter two is the discussion on March 24th.  The conversation is more historically grounded. Badiou has a knack for taking the long view and connecting events in ways that many of us have not considered before. For example, Badiou says that failures of the Paris Commune in 1848 led subsequent generations of revolutionaries to the conclusion that the Party was necessary.  Badiou believes this is why the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in the disaster of state-run communism. Badiou goes on to noodle over the issue of a new communist subject who has transcended the limitations of state citizenship. Badiou suggests that people have the potential to be part of something larger; where love, art and democracy have gained full expression.To be sure, this book contains numerous small insights. However, the wide-ranging inquiry leads us from one issue to the next without fully satisfying our curiosity. Problematically, these two brilliant people seem to enjoy discussing esoteric philosophical and historical subjects that frankly aren't of much value to most readers. For these reasons, I came away from this book slightly disappointed. Although there are insights to be gained, it seems to me that a more on-point discussion about the issues that matter to us today would have been far more valuable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZGSBT04Y63DD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745688365#wasThisHelpful","R2ZGSBT04Y63DD","A2F6NONFUDB6UK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F6NONFUDB6UK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Like Neame, all of the very capable supporting players are young, like-minded Brits who are serious about their craft.  The ensemble includes Tori Freestone on saxophone (and flute on one song), Jim Hart on vibraphone, Tom Farmer on bass and Dave Hamblett on drums. I think the quintet format really allows Neame's well-crafted songs to breathe as good jazz music should, allowing many fine moments of interplay, feeling and improvisation.I've come to appreciate the subtleties in this recording that keep me intrigued and wanting to play it again and again. The predominant influence on tunes such as ""Personality Clash"" is post-bop where the players delight us with their virtuosity, passion and inventiveness. ""OCD Blues"" and ""Crise de Nerfs"" feature shifting time signatures, challenging the ensemble to show range, personality and adaptability.  Of course, the title song, ""Strata"" is a clear standout where the acoustic sound is nicely complemented by light keyboard and sound vibrato effects (in a just world, ""Strata"" would be a sure-fire Chill radio hit). Suffice to say there are no weaknesses on this recording; just a compelling mix of creative, fresh sounds played by the next generation of jazz musicians. I think the future is in good hands.I highly recommend this excellent album to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6TPDF7RXLSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YHYS68S#wasThisHelpful","R3H6TPDF7RXLSX","A2F6NONFUDB6UK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F6NONFUDB6UK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I believe that everyone interested in the health benefits of magnesium should give this excellent product a try.I like to stay fit and value magnesium for its role in cell formation, heart health and blood pressure. 1 tablet equals 50% of the recommended daily value, meaning the 240 tablets in the bottle is sufficient for 4 months if I take the full daily dose.

"I'm very pleased with Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed. To me, Scotts is the gold standard in lawn care products. I believe that everyone who wants to start or replenish their lawns should give this excellent product a try.I have a mature lawn that gets stressed by heat and sun exposure in the front yard and pets in the back yard. I aerated the yard before applying Scotts Grass Seed to the areas that needed it the most. I was impressed with the relatively large size of the individual seeds and their distinctive blue color (which is useful because I can easily see where I've applied seed to the lawn).Care is easy.  I lightly sprinkled to keep the seeds from drifting.  Scotts Grass Seed absorbs the water unlike any other seed I've used. I like that there's very little chance of run-off.At this time, I am waiting for my latest application of seed to lead to regrowth.  However, I have used this product before Depending on weather conditions, I expect the seed will sprout within 1 to 2 weeks.

"As an owner of two small breed dogs, there's nothing I don't like about Solid Gold Star Chaser.  Solid Gold is a specialty pet foods manufacturer who deserves attention for its highly nutritious, holistic dry dog foods. I believe everyone who values their dog's health and wellness should give this excellent product a try.The top ingredients (in order) are chicken, chicken meal, peas, brown rice and pearled barley. This explains the high crude protein (26%) and crude fiber (4%) content. I like that Solid Gold blends eggs, super foods (carrots, pumpkin, cranberries and etc.), vitamins, Alaskan Pollock meal (also a good source of protein), omega fatty acids, probiotics (for digestion), taurine and L-carnitine. It's simply a splendid dry dog food.I find it useful to introduce Solid Gold food incrementally. Although probiotics no doubt helps, this is a very nutrient-rich food so there is a possibility of indigestion. My 25 pounder had no problem but my 12 pounder did get upset, so I cut back on her portions until the food was well-tolerated. But now that the adjustment has been made, I definitely plan to make Solid Gold a cornerstone of my pet's nutrition.I highly recommend Solid Gold to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VR5NO1T1P15D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIGK2C#wasThisHelpful","R3VR5NO1T1P15D","A2F6NONFUDB6UK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F6NONFUDB6UK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The UE Boom 2 is the wireless speaker I've always wanted. Logitech, who is well-known for its quality computer accessories, has applied its engineering skills to create a category-leading Bluetooth speaker. I believe that everyone looking for wireless sound on-the-go should put the UE Boom 2 at the top of their list.I found several things that distinguish the UE Boom 2 from most other wireless speakers I've tried. First, the wrap-around speaker design works really well. It distributes sound all around, filling the room in a way that other speakers cannot. Second, the UE Boom 2 is touch-sensitive.  I can pause and skip songs by tapping once or twice. Third, a free app allows me to customize the EQ settings just the way I want, when streaming music from my iPhone.And yes - as has been suggested elsewhere, the sound output is impressive!  The UE Boom 2 has no problem at all producing rich, deep bass sound (which can often be problematic for small, portable speakers). In fact, I am satisfied with the bass response without pushing the EQ anywhere close to the limit!  The UE Boom 2 handles the treble and mid range sounds just as impressively. All in all, I am very pleased with the full-spectrum sound produced by this great portable speaker.It should also be mentioned that the UE Boom 2 includes a protective case to store the UE Boom 2 and accessories, including instructions, a power plug and USB cable.I highly recommend the UE Boom 2 to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J0Y8FFMJALV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014M8ZO8S#wasThisHelpful","R1J0Y8FFMJALV","A2F6NONFUDB6UK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F6NONFUDB6UK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Empire of Self by Jay Parini is an authoritative biography of Gore Vidal, one of the giants of postwar American cultural, intellectual and political life.  Mr. Parini is an accomplished writer and English professor who literally spent decades friending Gore.  Written with unsurpassed insight, compassion and perspective, this exceptional book will appeal to everyone interested in Vidal including why his life mattered.To me, Vidal will always be the knowledgeable, empathetic and quick-witted intellectual who faced down the pompous William F. Buckley, Jr. in a series of debates at the 1968 Republican Party Convention. While I was too young to fully appreciate their exchange  which was considered cutting-edge for television at that time - it was easy to admire Vidal as a role model who could forcefully speak truth to power.  Here was a man who put his intellect to work for the people!In fact, reading Mr. Parinis biography has only deepened my appreciation.  Mr. Parini explains that Vidal was a progressive whose work often prefigured or predicted what was to come, including postmodern philosophy, the gay movie subplot, LGBT rights, drug legalization, the commercialization of sex, and the rise of religious fundamentalism versus the national security state (to name but a few).  Put simply, Vidal was a brilliant, well-traveled and exceptionally literate individual whose unique insights into American society have rarely been matched; and certainly, never duplicated.Mr. Parini writes about Vidals colorful social and private lives.  Vidal seemed to know everybody who was somebody in the literary, entertainment and political worlds in at least a half dozen major cities around the world.  Mr. Parini shares many dozens of colorful anecdotes that bring the story to life.  We gain access to amusing, tantalizing and interesting glimpses of a bygone era as witnessed through Vidals trademark wit and wisdom.  Of course, Mr. Parini writes at length about Vidals complicated love life in the most honest, sensitive and respectable way; which has become possible only due to Vidal's passing in 2012.I highly recommend this outstanding book to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26AM1PGZ1GYWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537565#wasThisHelpful","R26AM1PGZ1GYWI","A2F6NONFUDB6UK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F6NONFUDB6UK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think that Duru Shower Gel is a good economy-priced shower gel. I ordered the variety pack and split the individual bottles between myself, my son and wife. I suspect that Duru formulates its products with the female consumer in mind given the emphasis on floral-scented fragrances, but I think the Mango scent works for men, just the same.Duru is not an all-natural or organic product but it is cruelty-free (not tested on animals). I can't say that Duru lathered up as well as other soaps I've used. I need to squeeze out quite a lot of liquid whether I was using a loofa or a towel. So while it's inexpensive, the trade off is that I'll probably use more to get the same result.Overall, I think that Duru represents is a good choice for households who are less worried about buying an organic soap (which can easily cost 3 to 4 times as much) than getting a fair deal for the money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL7FRRWPKSVYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CCM02Y#wasThisHelpful","RL7FRRWPKSVYP","A2F6NONFUDB6UK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F6NONFUDB6UK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The top ingredients (in order) are deboned turkey, turkey meal and chicken meal. No doubt this is why the crude protein content measures a very impressive 33%.

Suffice to say it's all good.But that's not all.  The nutritionists have blended in other things to make this a kind of superfood. A generous 250 mgs. of glucosamine and 200 mgs. of chondroitin for joint health are included in each serving. Flaxseed and salmon oil contribute to skin and coat health. Finally, the kibbles are coated with probiotics to support digestion.Having said this, I found that my two small breed pets needed a little coaxing to appreciate the food.

Lucien Piccard is a world-class watchmaker who is respected for bringing Swiss know-how to the quartz watch business.

To protect the most expensive electronics.The most interior large pocket has thick padded, that also goes through the the back of the pack, so that cushion is on your back.I like the small slot, at the top the best, that is a horizontal way to store your phone, with a nice soft cloth sack, that you could even use to clean the screen.  It's a better option than the vertical pockets on the back, that are more narrow, and require you to dig down to get the phone.  There are 2 mesh compartments that make it easy to see stuff you store.  And the outer most flap is great for pens, and extra memory cards, etc.Water bottle mesh holder on the side, with yet another small zippered pocket.

The crown jewels are several iconic structures, such as the Woolworth building and the Singer building.  It really provides a good overview of the changing landscape in construction techniques and social structure.This is not a ""Saturday night"" couples game night, but more of a Saturday or Sunday with the kids that provides enough challenge for both kids and adults alike.

If you use one of the settings in between carpet and bare floor, the suction is considerably stronger on carpet.  While this isn't too loud, I wouldn't say is was quiet.

"I've used this type of device previously, in rehabilitation of a problem shoulder, and with acupuncture.I believe in it, and it seems to be effective for me.This particular product is not some cheesy gimmick.  A lot of development and thought went into this product.I love the fact that it is rechargeable and when not charging, it is mobile.There are 99 different settings on this, so you can build up to different levels, or whatever you feel comfortable with.When turning it too high, I get what might be described as an arm ""cramp"",  so be careful how you throttle it.You can set the intensity differently for each arm.  (that was probably a setting of 29 or 30)It has an automatic timer of 10 mins per session, that turns off when it's done.I feel refreshed when it's completed.The biggest downside are the gooey pads that you need to putThe side with the cross hatching, make sure to take the cover off from the middle of the pad, where the arrows indicate. I was trying to pull it up from the side, and that wasn't working.Also save the covers, as you need to cover the gooey pads after you use it.The other downside, is that it has a lot of wires, so it takes a bit getting used to, to put it on, without getting tangled.Otherwise, I've noticed a difference in my arm tone and feeling after a week of use.I like it as a supplement to my regular workout routine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T57XPC9FB8YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011U19SX2#wasThisHelpful","R2T57XPC9FB8YN","A8WXLST0944GZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8WXLST0944GZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:40 Mins I weight 200 pounds and am 6ft tall.This bike carries me speedily with no problem.Even small hills are not a problem, although slower.I will update my review as I continue to use this.I'm most curious about the battery life.UPDATE 6/14/15:  I use this bike more than any manual bike I've ever owned.I now better understand the handlebar battery level lights.  When you have it at full throttle up a hill it may only show red.The same full throttle on a flat surface might only show yellow or even green if laying off the throttle a bit.In summary, it seems to indicate your available batt life ""if you continue at your current pace"".The battery does take a FULL 5.5 hours to charge.

"Picked this up on sale recently, because I wanted to update some of the features on my camera. (like wifi).I was also looking for something I could carry around a little easier, than my full size DSLR.This camera exceeded my expectations in both performance and features.It's simply amazing, in this price range.  The only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't have a raised hand grip handle, which makes it slightly more difficult to hold one handed, but it's not really that big of a deal.If you have a wifi ecosystem at home, but more specifically, other Samsung products, this camera pairs nicely and easily with those devices.Another really nice feature of this camera is that the display screen on the back is also ""touchscreen"", so you can opt for that is an option, if you don't feel like fumbling for which button is the ""return"" button or the ""cancel"" button.  It just makes it easier.This model takes the micro-sd cards and it does NOT come with one, so make sure you have one of those before, if you want to save a little bit.The camera takes VERY good quality pictures in low light, but does have a reasonable pop-up flash, for most, close range shots.The other thing that I LOVE about this camera, is that the normal full range picture, has a VERY wide picture angle. Almost the equivalent of a fish-eye lens but not quite, and not with the curve.  The zoom, does sometimes take a few seconds to adjust and zoom in, but when it does, it's worth it.  I will try to update this review as I continue to explore the features, but for the money and the features, this camera is a WINNER!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PR9OSKDTERS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VYAKZUK#wasThisHelpful","R2PR9OSKDTERS9","A8WXLST0944GZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8WXLST0944GZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a very well done book, but it didn't do it for me.  It was not a cover to cover read (which most D.B. books are).It is the first book in a series, and I struggled to get into the book.  I think I was 4 chapters in before I wanted to continue.  I persevered b/c of the author.  I pushed myself to finish it, but this book did not have that intangible quality for me that made me want to put the world on hold to finish it.  In fact I had to struggle not to read another book that came out that day instead.  This is not usually the case.I thought Amanda was a little...over the top.  I never really connected with her, and her mission to prove that she could do this was just not plausible for me.  I never saw her drive, or the reason for it.  She wanted to go into the green- but she had been sneaking in anyway.  This might just be first book issues where it is laying out the series, but I guess overall that is what I felt, that this book was a layout and there was still a lot to come that this book did not answer.  A lot of the plot seemed forced so that outcome B could happen so they could move on to next thread of story.This also chemistry wise was a bit flat.  I was glad we were being told they werre attracted to each other b/c did not feel it otherwise.  I am not trying to bash the book.  It was well done, for whatever reason for me the story did just not resonate.My rating system is 5 stars - Need next book now now now, where can I pre order4 stars - definitely getting next book, but have a couple others will read before that b/c sometimes back to back shows flaws3 stars - good book - would buy the author again, maybe not this series unless I liked preview2 stars - finished it1 star - utter crap not worth the downloadFor me this fell right in between auto buying next book b/c I love the author and checking the preview.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R380CL3PLTUU2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WBFNVM#wasThisHelpful","R380CL3PLTUU2H","A3NNQL8PGWP33S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NNQL8PGWP33S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They do a great job painting the picture of what they went through.I highly recommend this story if you want an accurate account of what happened without all the speculation that you get from the press.These men have a remarkable story that should be known.

"I love this series, which is interesting because I had trouble getting started with the first book.  Now it is one of those books where I must own the second they come out and Susan Ilene does not disappoint.When I read the premise of this and what was happening at the beginning it wove a fine tension around me wondering what would happen.  Would this hurt their relationship?  I am not going to answer that because you should feel the same emotions.  I will say the author did a wonderful job pleasing this reader with the outcome.Melena is such a great Heroine - she has a good strong character, she is flawed and she is NOT irritating.  It is so nice to have a strong female lead that doesn't cross into psycho B trying to prove how tough she is.  She is a good balance of smart aleck and responsible adult.  In other words she is real.Lucas is wonderfully arrogant, while still being so great with Melena.  Again, a balance is struck with this Hero, and it makes him really work as a character.Kerbasi - I think he has in some ways become my favorite side character.  He is coming along so well.  He always makes you wonder where he is at as he evolves.  I think it is further than we suspect.The world building is fantastic.  The characters have depth.  You should not read this as a stand a lone, it needs to be read in order.  I will give you the booklist, just so you don't have to search :).  (I hate that)1. Darkness Haunts (Full Book)2.

What a maroon!!!  She is supposed to be older and smarter than this.  I expect this delusional martyred thinking from a 22 year old not a 40 year old.On the other side of this coin, I was fully invested in the book, I was literally asking my husband, ""What is she thinking?""  and he just rolled his eyes and turned up the news b/c I was ranting over a book.The reason this does not get 5 stars is b/c Claire turned into total bridezilla,  I don't understand freaking out of the cost of something minor, but then having crazy over the top stuff that she doesn't bat an eye on b/c she won't ""compromise"".  Only part of the book I did not really like.  This happened multiple occasions.  It made me dislike her a little tiny bit.  She totally redeems herself, but really??? It must be this, this, this and this, and if it isn't I will pout.  WTH???So book is still amazing, but Claire is a little grating.  Jonathan is perfect as always.

"Glazed DonutIt tastes nothing like a donut - they are a relatively soft bar, they consistency reminds me a little bit of (this is dating myself) food stick's from the 70's. Kind of soft and chewy. The flavor is NOTHING like a donut - if I were to name the flavor it would be maple oatmeal or something like that with out the oats. There is a distinct after taste, not sure what it is - not soapy like someone else said, for me it is more like the flavor after touching your tongue to a battery. The flavor kinda numbs the taste buds or something.Here is the thing - if there was another option out there for being strict paleo, I wouldn't touch these on a bet. Problem is there is not. So if you are willing to choke it down b/c you have trouble getting meals in and want something portable, buy it. Kudos to the company for making these and giving us ANY option. But unless these are a necessity for health reasons of some sort, I would pass.Chocolate Mint - 1 of the most disgusting things I have ever put in my mouth - Definitely got Soapy on this one. My opinion is if Soap and crayons made a baby, this would be it. Ewww, Ewww, EwwwFudge Brownie - Tingly tongue like I touched it to a battery still, but sorta chocolatey. Could be after the mint thing, anything would be better.Cinnamon Roll - Again, tingly tongue - but edible. I have beeen eating 1 a day as lunch meal, and I don't know if I am getting used to them, but I sort of liked this one.Caramel - Not as tingly and I liked it. Maybe they are also brainwashing me, I have noticed that some of the bars when I open them have a white waxy build up on them and they tend to be the most disgusting of the group. So maybe something happened temperature wise to affect some bars???? IDK - but I paid 40 bucks for meal replacements and I will finish them - well all except the other chocolote mint that tastes like waste from a crayon factory.Last 1 in the box was moldy and I was releived.

"OMG!!! So glad I skipped the negative reviews.  I downloaded this at 11:00 last night and could NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!!  I loved it so much I purchased the sequel and finished that at work.Claire is 39, hallelujah - she has life experience and I was hooked on the first page.  She was outspoken, real and believable (if you are anywhere close to this age bracket). She had depth and children, and yes she suffered from martyr syndrome, but she is a Mom, so that was completely real to me.Jonathan is pretty much a walking Orgasm near as I can tell.  Loved him.  He just gets better.  The background on the characters fill them out fully.Side characters are interesting.Plot - pretty good, basically this a like the best smut sandwich anywhere - hawt sex, likeable characters, long story that can stand alone, very reasonable price.  So if you like your smut with a possessive alpha, and a woman that does not roll over and like the whole story behind it - this is the book for you.I have already purchased and read all her other books since reading this last night, haunted her website which after you read the 2nd book - you have got to read the Mocha Monday follow up - PS dying here on that.This was fantastic and I have a new auto purchase author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R286IFH23HJMVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DODQAJK#wasThisHelpful","R286IFH23HJMVI","A3NNQL8PGWP33S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NNQL8PGWP33S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed the book and will read the sequel (probably)This book was a quick read, but there were inconsistencies in the story.  H only saw in black in white, but then later talked about when she was a little girl watching tv and being in awe of the colors of the wings.  That throws you out of the story a bit.This is one where if the sequel would have been out, I would have downloaded it fairly quickly to read the next book, but the longer I have away from it the less pressing the need feels.  I read a lot and the book really needs to stick with me for me to continue series or I will forget about it.  This one while enjoyable in the now, is not turning out to be memorable for me.If you like Urban Fantasy YA, I would give this one a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XRBWL527NC86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5U6O24#wasThisHelpful","R2XRBWL527NC86","A3NNQL8PGWP33S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NNQL8PGWP33S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Enjoyable read.  Lots of plot lines coming together.  This book was very solid and enjoyable, and to date, my favorite of all the Melinda Leigh books.While a couple parts seemed improbable it was put together well and I think it is more probable than I think.  I just can not believe the things people will do sometimes.  There were some unexpected twists which is always nice.  I do like it when it is not completely predictable and this wasn't.  Normally I can figure everything out, and in this a few things took me by surprise.The characters were strong.  There were a couple times I wish Ellie would have trusted Grant sooner, but could understand why she didn't.  Grant is great, and the kids just broke my heart.I will purchase next book in the series.  While, I wont be dying to read it (which is why not 5 stars)  I will definitely get it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32XA0C3936RUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTBWMVO#wasThisHelpful","R32XA0C3936RUM","A3NNQL8PGWP33S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NNQL8PGWP33S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had this for about a month now and I love it.  I wear it even when lifting weights and it does not bother me in the slightest.The only thing I have noticed is that my finger under the band developed a slick spot???  Skin is peeling a little and dry from the material. It does not itch, and I do not notice it unless I slide the band around; however, I do have peeling dandriffish type skin that comes off when I remove my ring, or builds up if I leave it on, and that is a little gross.  Don't know if this is a just me thing, but it is the reason I did not give it 5 stars.I also purchased a matching one for my Husband and he is pretty happy with it so far.  He works in automotive, so he feels he can wear this safely.For me this is also a great solution when I travel to other countries.

"Update - Purchased and started using in September, it is now April, and I am starting to get dark imprints on papers.  I think it is getting low and not performing as well now.  Still think this is a great deal over the cartridge I normally purchase for 150.00.  Just bought my replacement for this and everything is working great again.  We are a light/medium office copy wise as we move more things to digital.  So I would say I probably got 3500 copies out of this before replaced toner.Bought this on a chance and have waited to write a review,  I have had this for over a month now and no issues, is working great.  Even if wasn't working great the price is worth the risk.

"This book was so repetitive.  The characters didn't grow, they just kept repeating the same immature mistakes.  Lots of yelling, lots of crying. So much immaturity it was no longer adorable or sexy, it was just Grow up already!!!I was in disbelief the longer I read the book because you knew he was going to start clenching his hands and she was going to start getting nervous, and he was going to be a complete and utter publicly embarrassing dipstick and she was going to look like an idiot for putting up with him, and she did and he was.The immaturity was just over the top on this one.  There wasn't a relationship  - there was sex and temper tantrums and little else.  Oh wait, there was also alcohol.  This book felt totally useless to the series.  Best part was the epilogue, would have liked to have seen how he became that person rather than dealing with the same exact issues from previous 2 books.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OV1832TQW17A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MR5VEXS#wasThisHelpful","R3OV1832TQW17A","A3NNQL8PGWP33S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NNQL8PGWP33S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Fox and Molly are a great couple but I was much more interested in Charlie and Gabriel and Noah and Kit.It looks like next book is going to be David and Thea.

I could not put this book down.  I tried the sample and bought immediately and then devoured this book.  I have already pre-ordered the second book.I saw in other reviews that this was not a complete story.  It was when I Purchased it, so if it started life as a serial it became a complete book.  And what a book.  Natalie was wonderful.  Strong, smart, funny.  She is fantastic.  And S - oh just, no other way to put it, he is a total panty melter.  Goodness, I haven't read an Alpha that good in a long time, and even when N thought he was being a jerk, you could tell he was torn up about it.Best part of the book is Natalie didn't want to change him, just understand and share the burdens.

It was very well done and realistic.I am looking forward to reading other books by this author.I thought the way the community broke down and some of the problem faced to be entirely real.

"I loved and pampered this stupid machine for 2 years.  I only put bottled water in it so it wouldn't get mineral deposits, I faithfully cleansed it with vinegar.It gave me hot coffee.  I like it not super hot, my husband likes it REALLY hot, after about 90 minutes he would need to microwave it and I thought it was finally coming out at a drinkable temperature.  When I pour my first cup out of the pot as it finishes I only pour 1/2 a cup and let it sit for about 5 minutes before I can drink it.Flavor was good.  We really had no issues at all until this am.  We hit the brew button and it gave us a high pitched shriek not unlike an enraged R2 Unit, the only way to shut it up was to unplug it.I do feel a coffee maker should make it more than 2 years which is why it got 4 stars.  That said, because I will have a back up carafe and all the filters already, I will be replacing it with same.  I see that coffee makers have shorter shelf lives these days.

"After reading his book I looked into purchasing the next in the series;however,the synopsis did not do anything for me. Then I found the note the author left at the back of the second book chastising readers in advance if they did not like her book.I hope getting that off her chest makes up for lack of continued purchases.The book is fairly solid.  If there is a complaint about it it was the way Syrus was continually compared to a child.  Once or twice fine.  But over and over it becomes hard to see him as a romantic interest.I don't want to give spoilers.  The book is fairly fast paced and moves quickly.  The H/H are strong although I did not quite connect to Syrus. Again I feel that could be the juvenile comparisons.  Forest is a very intriguing character that has a lot of depth.  This would have been 5 stars had Syrus been that way as well and I would have not read synopsis would have just purchased next book.I found the book overall enjoyable and had the synopsis sounded better on the next book I would have eventually purchased it.  Finding out about a rant at the end of the book took that away.If you want to rant get a blog.  Pre whining to readers is very immature. Also I daresay you have returned something in your life.  Get over it. If your writing is good loyal fans will build your reader base.  If people don't like your book they may return it and tell people they didn't like it.  This is the part of life that sucks dealing with customers.  All self employed people are sympathetic but that means vent to friends and other authors not the customer.  Normally I would not get into this, but you out this in the public forum.I found your book to be solid which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I won't take your personality out on your book.My overall opinion of this book is if you like paranormal you should like this.  It is more relationship driven than action.

"In order to make our son's teeth brushing routine more appealing to him, we got a fun electric toothbrush and these colorful flossers. I'm going to start with the cons because they're are more of those than pros.Cons:-Not really fun animal shapes as I expected-Not sturdy. They are so flimsy that they would kind of lean and bend when trying to floss his teeth-Floss isn't very strong. A couple busted when trying to floss and we weren't doing it very hard-They hurt my son's mouth I'm going back to regular flossers because these are just awful.Pros:-They're colorfulI'm not happy with these at all","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10OXSMB87U6RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UB6UJ22#wasThisHelpful","R10OXSMB87U6RA","A2MTPVW8JI634V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MTPVW8JI634V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My daughter likes to teethe on the silicone beads too.I like that you can clip toys and other baby safe things to keep your baby occupied.

"Although we do have a dish washer, we always make sure to thoroughly scrub our dishes beforehand. This comes in a set of two. We use one for our dishes. These heavy duty scouring scrubbers work nicely because they help remove all of the food and grease very easily. It works better than our old sponge that was too soft and wouldn't remove everything very well. Also, our sponges would end up tearing apart and not lasting very long. The material on these scrubbers is way better quality and I can tell that they will last a lot longer than the old sponges. They're tough on scrubbing but don't scratch up the dishes, wish is great.Since this pack came with two, I use the other one to scrub fruits and veggies. It works excellent for that.

"I bake and I grill food often. These are cool gloves because they are made from high quality silicone and are therefore resistant to heat. I've used them for both grilling and baking and they kept me from burning my hands. They have tiny bumps all over them that helps you grip things, such as a hot cookie sheet, pan, tongs, etc. This way you won't accidently drop whatever you just cooked. I've actually had that happen before. So sad.These also work for when you are taking baked potatoes or food that's in foil out of the oven or off of the grill. You can't feel the high heat on your hands.These are nice for almost anyone's hands. My husband's hands are larger than mine but they fit both of us just fine and there is still a tiny bit of wiggle room for both of us.

"This is one of the most useful tools to have in your kitchen, especially if you need something to slice or shred up your veggies.

It does slice evenly and when the piece gets too small, you can use the ""handle"" to hold the veggie in place and scrape against the blade until done. It does save you some time since cutting with a regular knife can take a while.You can toss all of the pieces in the dishwasher which is convenient.I received this product at a discounted price in order to facilitate my review.

"Now, although I worked in the bar industry for several years, in the past, I feel that there is still a lot if things that I didn't know though about.  Bitters is actually one of those things. It's fun to come across a book like this because after reading  it, I've learned how to make a drink go from boring to new and fresh. A book like this would be perfect for a new bartender or even someone who just likes to make their own drinks. It's fun to try new concoctions and be able to serve them like a pro when you have company over.Mixology can be so much fun when you actually know what you're doing.One thing that I did learn long ago from working in this industry and it is also stated in the book---you can never make a drink exactly like the last. A drink will always be slightly different. One tiny difference can also make a drink go from not too bad to amazing.The recipes in this book sound very appealing to me and many of them will be tried out in the future, when I'm no longer nursing. I'm also looking forward to making handcrafted drinks and trying them out on other people and seeing how they like them.I received this book in exchange for my unbiased review.

"I like wine, but im in no way a wine expert.

"My favorite time of year is finally here and I'm always looking for new materials and ideas for my costume. I'm a do-it-yourself kind of person and prefer making my own, rather than buying something pre-made.

"This nursing cover has a very pretty design on it. It is opaque and provides excellent privacy when nursing your baby. It has an adjustable neck strap and a collar that is round instead of flat so that you can see your baby as he or she feeds. That is my favorite part, especially now that my baby is older and doesn't like being covered much. With this, she can see my face and is content while eating. She can also breathe better with this sort of cover.I have a couple of other similar covers, but this one has a few nicer additional features. It has pockets, which are nice to store tiny toys, a pacifier, pamper, a couple of wipes (in a ziploc bag), or wash cloth inside, to take with you. It's nice to have that option so you don't have to get up and disturb your baby. Also, another feature my others don't have is the strap that ties around your back like an apron. This is good because it simply holds the cover in place better.  It's just one less thing to worry about since your cover won't blow away and expose you outdoors, in a windy area.It can be used as a car seat/ stroller cover or thin blanket for your baby as well.This cover can be folded up neatly and stored in the little matching drawstring bag that it comes with.I don't really have any major complaints, because this cover doesn't what it was intended to do. However, I do think that the part of the collar that rounds out could be a little thicker so that it stays round and doesn't fold up. Then it would hold up better.I received this product at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

"I've been nursing my daughter for a few months now, but her feeding patterns have changed quite a few times, so at times I do end up leaking again. I was using disposable nursing pads but I get tired of buying those over and over and tossing them in the trash. These reusable nursing pads are simply more practical. They come with a few extra so all I have to do I can just switch between them . Then they can all just go in the washer , get cleaned, and then are ready to be used again.The material on the pads is very soft and thick enough to help keep leaks from soaking through my bra and onto my shirt. They absorb very well. I feel more confident when I go out because I don't have to worry about embarrassing myself with a soaked shirt.I'm very pleased with this product. They're a pretty pink color, are the perfect size for excellent coverage, absorb well, are machine washable, and fit comfortably inside of my bra.I received this product in exchange for my honest review, since I blog frequently.

"I needed something like this in my entertainment room in my house because we usually have quite a few things that have to be plugged in and not always anywhere to plug them into. This makes it so simple because they can all be plugged into the same outlet with this handy little wall mount. For some reason, it was easy to screw this onto the wall, but it just would not lay as flat as I hoped. It still worked correctly thought.I do like that you can cover the outlets not being used. Also, it will let you know if it is grounded and safe for use.The coolest part about his device is that it has a couple of USB slots on the bottom of it. How great, right?

"This is a GREAT ring sling carrier. It's thick and very supportive under my baby. It feels good on my shoulder-it rests flat on my shoulder and doesn't cause any strain or pressure when my baby is carried in it.I love the colors I chose, which are the blue with brown (blueberry brownie). I also like that the rings are not made from metal like on my other sling. The rings seem to really hold the material just fine without it tangling up. The rings are tough and they don't look like they will wear out or break easily.I love putting my baby in this sling when we go out. She likes to look around, is always smiley and alert while in this or sleeping really well.  I am so happy to have this product.

"I like the fact that this product has coconut oil and argan oil, which are two products that I use on my hair regularly.I actually tried this product on my son's hair since he loves to wear his hair in a fauxhawk. I applied it to his hair and it stayed up for about an hour. I didn't apply too much but I was hoping that it would keep his hair up longer. Even though it didn't keep it straight up like I had hoped that it would, it still kept his hair styled and looked cute on him. This product is a sticky pomeade so it does hold little hairs together well. It isn't stiff or thick, so this is why it won't hold it up for more bold hairstyles like I mentioned before. It does say ""medium hold"" though, so that makes sense.I do like that this product is not completely filled with chemicals. It's alcohol, paraben, and sodium-chloride free.

"I love how great these glasses look in my kitchen. I also love the way that the glasses are designed.

Not that I care what people think, since bursting id's 100% natural and my baby's gotta eat,but a cover does provide some privacy. I own other covers that I do like, but this one is unique since the collar part curves out. The person who created this was really smart to design it this way. With this cover, you can actually see your baby while he/she is eating. That is perfect. Normally I have to blindly adjust mutt daughter with my hand or lift up the cover to see what I'm doing. With this one, it's so much easier. Also the collar part is adjustable and the material is thin and light. It won't cling to the baby's skin, nor is it too heavy on baby either.

"This is such a wonderful product. It is the type of thermometer that I've been wanting and needing for a long time. It is very easy to use for either reading forehead temp or inside the ear. I like that it has a backlit and easy to read display too. It comes with a nice cradle to hold it in, as well as a little blue carrying pouch. It all fits easily in a bag for traveling purposes.This thermometer is great to have around, especially when you have young ones. I'm happy to have it since taking an oral temp is not always easy to do with my son and my baby is too young for that. Now I have just get a forehead or ear temp reading in a matter of seconds without any problem.UPDATE*****I've had this product for a few months now and it was working great up until yesterday. It is malfunctioning. We haven't damaged it in anyway. When I tried to read my baby's temp it kept saying 134 degrees and up. When I took my own temp it was over 270 degrees. I figured maybe it needed new batteries. I put new ones in and it won't even give me a temp now. It beeps and just says L and Fahrenheit sign. Really frustrated.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

"Social media is huge right now. Practically everyone has either a Twitter account, Facebook, Instagram, tumblr, or other social media account. It's the ""in"" thing right now. I have every one of those and others.Although so many people use social media in one way or another, not everyone realizes just how powerful social media is today. Companies can lose a ton of buyers  if they receive even just a handful of bad reviews. People from one side of the world can read what people on the completely other end of the world think about products, celebrities, restaurants....the list is never-ending. The internet is so huge and is only getting bigger. Social media can be used for both good and bad.I like this book a lot because it tells people who are completely unaware , although that's a bit hard these days, all about the impact social media has. It's an eye opening book for so many people out there, I think especially for older generations. I will be sharing this book with the older people in my family who don't believe that social media can be so powerful. Very informative book, in my opinion.I received this book for reviewing purposes.

"This is by far the best biography I have read of Lincoln, and possibly one of the best biographies in general. Donald's unique approach is to tell only the parts of the story that Lincoln himself was aware of. So little is said of the Confederate government, since Lincoln generally did not know what they were doing. He does not dwell on battles, but only explains how they came about and what their effects were. The story is centered entirely on Lincoln and all that he thought and experienced.Donald does a wonderful job tracing an already familiar story and telling it in a new and thoughtful way. He emphasizes the incredible stress and pressure that fell on Lincoln as president. The frustrations were immense, yet he retained an incredible degree of wisdom throughout. Donald shows that Lincoln made some poor decisions early on, but quickly learned how to manage his Cabinet, generals, and Congress.This book will leave the reader in awe at Lincoln's brilliance, for such a humble and unassuming man. Even those who already revere Lincoln will find cause to admire him even more. This book is not a hagiography, but it simply highlights the challenges Lincoln faced and the masterful way he met them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13HH66SBD22XY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTJY542#wasThisHelpful","R13HH66SBD22XY","A28YBL28P03P8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28YBL28P03P8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fascinating book. Svenson bought a piece of land that had once been the site of a minor Civil War battle. This book is an account of his cultivation of the land, fitting into the community, and learning about the battle and the experience of the soldiers. The main narrative is about his taking care of the land. Interspersed into this is his accounts of various aspects of the battle. It is fair to say that Svenson became an expert on the battle, as his accounts are highly detailed and nuanced.Somewhat surprisingly, I found the narrative to be the best part of the book. His stories of building a pond, learning to farm hay, etc all are well written and enjoyable to read. His accounts of the battle, however, are dull and confusing. There are insufficient maps, too many minor details, all of which leave a muddled picture of the battle. I bought the book for the Civil War part of it, but thoroughly enjoyed it for his narrative. Depending on your interests, you might enjoy this book. But don't assume that every Civil War buff will enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Z989UAG7ZEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0571197981#wasThisHelpful","R22Z989UAG7ZEY","A28YBL28P03P8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28YBL28P03P8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Symonds wrote this book as a sort of response the classic ""Lincoln and His Generals"" by T. Harry Williams. Symonds suggests that William's great book left out the significant contributions of the navy. So this book examines closely the role of the navy and its various admirals to the war effort. But, unlike Williams' great and enjoyable book, Symonds' book seems more disjointed and less focused. Perhaps this is because of the reality that the navy did not contribute as significantly or as consistently to the war effort as the army did. This means he had to spend several pages explaining the achievements of the army before he can explain how the navy contributed to their actions. This makes for dull reading for those who are already familiar with the course of events.This book does succeed in focusing on the role and contributions of various admirals. The intrigue and emotions of the Navy Department, the role of Gideon Welles, and the top admirals are all laid out here. Lincoln's dealings with various admirals is also well-addressed.

The red side (actually shown as blue here, so not sure about why that is...) will play all instruments and change songs. But you can hit each other side to stop/start that instrument. So you can play just one instrument or any combination of them.

But it's not very ""springy"" and maybe it's not supposed to. It doesn't try to retract when stretched out. For fans of Toy Story, this is a pretty cool toy, and it's really big, which is fun for kids.But a couple things I wasn't too excited about. The dog looks depressed. The box shows a happy looking dog from the movie, but the actual toy looks like a miserable dog. Secondly, it has no structural integrity. It's head sags constantly.

"This is an awesome kids game that adults will enjoy playing. There are four train engines, many animal cars, and some moose cabooses. The goal is to build up trains based on matching colors on the edge of each card. Once you have a long train and a caboose that matches, you can play the caboose and take all the cards in that train (except the engine). The goal is to get as many cards as you can. You obviously want the trains to grow long, but risk someone else grabbing it from you. But if you take them too short, you might run out of caboose cards.This is a lot of fun! It teaches kids a little bit of critical thinking and strategizing. An adult could easily beat a kid in this game, but if you play nice it could be fun for both kid and adult. And certainly kids can play this on their own without any adult help.The artwork is great as well. The cards are better than most regular playing cards, but could easily be destroyed by little kids. It would have been nice if these were a stiff cardboard, but that's okay. Lots of fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZUD1M4YIU03O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013INMJWC#wasThisHelpful","R2ZUD1M4YIU03O","A28YBL28P03P8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28YBL28P03P8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good deal for mouse-traps. And these are much nicer than the old-school wooden ones. Because the snap-bar is an L-shape, it allows you to lift it and release the mouse without having to actually touch it. That also makes it easier to reset and reuse. I've had great success with these. They are very sensitive and I've never had one go off without catching the mouse. They are powerful, so it's certainly instant death for the mouse (often the tip or flip because of the force). Not quite as nice as the Tomcat Press 'N Set Mouse Trap, 2-Pack, but still quite nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DV0ZVLJ6KZGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B9XPOO#wasThisHelpful","R1DV0ZVLJ6KZGZ","A28YBL28P03P8V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28YBL28P03P8V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When our kid was born, we used mostly swaddling blankets. We had one swaddle outfit, but it was a heavy fleece, so not always the best. The problem with blankets is that even when they are tucked in right, a wiggly kid can often work them loose. These are brilliant because they use Velcro, so there is no risk of them coming undone. They are a nice, soft fabric and have subtle but clear patches where your Velcro should attach. They open up enough that you can change diapers in them without removing the swaddle entirely, but it's still kind of awkward.The colors here seem like they could be uni-sex, which is really nice. The lions are cute!The only thing that had us baffled was the slit in the back. Turns out its for harness straps for swings or whatever. On the one hand, this is brilliant for parents who want to have their baby swaddled in a swing. On the other hand, it's an odd, ugly hole in the back for parents who just want a nice swaddle suit for a crib. I've never seen other swaddle suits that have this, so I'm not sure how important it was to include. Anyway, they have nice patterns and designs and are clearly well-made.

"The idea of mechanical colored pencils is pretty brilliant. I didn't think this kind of thing existed, but it's nice because I prefer mechanical pencils to begin with. This makes it far less messy for sharpening as well. These work really nicely and have a triangular shape, which isn't my ideal, but not a big problem.The only thing that I would consider a drawback is that compared to regular Crayola colored pencils, these are not as vibrant or bold when you are done coloring.

"I haven't been able to give this a full grow cycle, but Amazon wants this review. So, it seems pretty cool. The LED lights are nice, but they are SUPER bright. I am tempted to put this in my garage or a closet, but that's probably not best. It's so stinking bright, it's awkward to have sitting around unless it's in an out-of-the-way room of your house (which I don't have one of those).But the pods that come with are very easy to set up and most of them sprouted in 5-8 days. The sensors seem pretty smart and able to tell you when it should be refilled, which is nice. You can kind of forget about it, as long as you pay attention to the warning lights.The light adjuster seems a little wobbly when you are raising and lowering it, but since you don't need to do that much, that's probably okay.It's supposed to produce full plants in six months, but you can start harvesting once they are started. The nice thing is having fresh herbs in the winter and because you only pick what you need, it just keeps growing. This is totally carefree, which is good for me, because otherwise they'd probably all be dead.

"We have an Evenflo forward-facing car seat and just got this one for our other vehicle. This is twice the cost, but it is so much nicer. This can be a rear-facing infant seat, forward-facing baby seat, and toddler booster seat. The fabric is very nice and sturdy, and there is plenty of padding to make it comfortable. It has recline settings, so even forward-facing kids can sleep without their head falling forward. The recline lever is under their legs, so easy to reach for forward-facing.The infant insert is easy to remove and the seat belt is easy to adjust. The head rest moves up and down very easily. There are slots to put the buckles on the side when not clipped in, so they are easier to find (so your kid isn't sitting on them), but the buckles fall out easily and are more hassle than they are worth. The chest clip is annoyingly difficult to undo, compared to other carseats. Two cup holders, but work well for holding toys as well.Overall, we are very pleased with this carseat.

I tried one from the recipe book that comes along with it and it was tasty, if kind of ugly. It's great for cooking tomato sauce without it splashing all over the place.

"This trundle bed is so cute. Please remember it does come unassembled so you will need a screwdriver to assemble it. It came with easy to follow instructions and I put it together in less than 5 minutes. The trundle part of the bed is basically a freestanding drawer that slides in and out but is not attached to the bed at all. It is a very cute design. I did have one issue when assembling the trundle drawer. On the side in the front where the screws go in, the little piece of board that the screws screw into broke in half. I used my glue gun to glue it back together. I noticed the other corners of the trundle were also starting to crack. This is likely due to the board being a little bit thin. Even so it was an easy fix and I know my girls are going to love playing with this. It fits the 18 inch dolls perfectly. For the price this is a really good buy even with the issue that I had. I easily could have spent double or triple that amount buying one from the name brand all stores. I recommend this product to anyone that has children who likes to play with the larger dolls.

I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a better luxurious shower head.I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4GM8OG0YI7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0YUWXE#wasThisHelpful","R1P4GM8OG0YI7K","A309AHGTGYTURE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A309AHGTGYTURE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used TheraBreath perhaps around 20 years ago. They were probably a small dental office, but they already shipped worldwide. My goal then when I was in the dating scene was to have awesome fresh breath day and night. My problem was not really chronic bad breath, but I was sensitive to foods with high amounts of sugar including fruits. Any consumption of those and guaranteed my breath would not be as pleasant as the bacteria in my mouth feeds into the sugar. I was amazed how effective the product is but how much expensive it was.Fast forward to the present and look how big TheraBreath has grown. From the packaging to the product line. But one thing that hasn't changed is the price. I was hoping in a decade or so TheraBreath or other manufacturers will follow suit is mass producing the revolutionary concept then. It appears major toothpaste manufacturers are disappointingly not into this simple effective idea of highly oxygenating the mouth.Trying this TheraBreath Plus Professional Formula is like visiting an old friend. It's still as effective and revolutionary as it was back then. The good is they have a winning product and command of the market. The bad is that the price is still out of reach for the common people to work as an everyday product to replace the commercial toothpastes.Until they can bring the price down to competitive levels, people will always be hesitant to try the TheraBreath line and even if they do with highly effective results, the sad truth is it simply isn't sustainable economically.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32P6FW08NRGM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFU5GXG#wasThisHelpful","R32P6FW08NRGM2","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like everyone else wanting to be healthy, I consciously try to buy organic and/or one with natural ingredients. The current shampoo and body wash I use for my kids right now is the Honest line which isn't organic, but is claimed to at least be less toxic than say the shampoo and body wash we all grew up with.I had high hopes for the Natures Baby Organics Shampoo and Body Wash. For a scant 16oz and especially for it's price, I would have expected a great product that's thick. I would have imagined you don't need to use much and that the bottle will go a long way. I also would have expected great packaging.For the first issue I pointed out, the liquid was too watery I ended up having to use more. This means the product will not last as long as I expect it to be than the other products I use. You know that occurrence when you try to extend the life of a liquid soap by adding more water? It's that yucky watery feeling.The second issue is that the liquid content arrived leaking all over the box it arrived in. I can't understand why vendors think they can just seal their product with a cap. For an organic product, they don't attempt to place a proper seal to protect the contents first of all from contamination and then from leaking. Then there is the issue of the cap in itself not being water tight. So anytime the bottle is not upright during transport, the liquid will seep through.And that's what happened to this product when I received it. The bottle was wrapped in plastic as if the vendor already knew the issue and tries to resolve it by not securing the actual liquid from leaking out from the bottle, but by securing the bottle so it won't leak as much on the box. Well it did. I got a wet soapy box.The only redeeming factor is that the smell of coconut and pineapple is lovely. It's just a shame it's too watery and not properly and hygienically sealed to prevent tampering.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J04YZ9E83WSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2IN9GA#wasThisHelpful","R3J04YZ9E83WSG","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't expect much from this Jackson Safety V50 Calico Polycarbonate Eyewear, but when these arrived I was surprised how awesome these look, feel, and are constructed.These are from Kimberly-Clark Professional division which I use their blue professional automotive one-time use gloves.

"Holy peanut butter cups! This is 66.7 ounces of chocolate peanut butter goodness. That's 4 pounds / 1.89KG to you!It's the classic Reese's Peanut Butter Cups we all love in a smaller sized version. Disclaimer: When I say we I mean everyone that grew up with Reese's and are lucky not to posses peanut allergy.In any case, I love these individually wrapped smaller cups which I can store in containers at home and at work within reach from the keyboard.What made me refrain from giving five stars is that when I see the word miniature, I was expecting smaller single-serve cups. These ""miniature"" cups are still too big. Well, of course these are small than the original Reese's size, but I wouldn't call these miniature.I'm still waiting for the actual miniature cups.

"It's okay. It's cute to look at and it will make you laugh with your baby wearing the towel. However for the price of this towel I expected a lot more than laughs. I expected quality construction and premium thick cotton material. Instead I sewing of the ""teeth"" on the towel is questionable. They didn't sew it properly that two of the teeth are falling apart because the thread didn't completely touch on all the teeth fabric.Then more importantly the towel is a bit too thin especially for this price. I buy ultra thick towels around four times thicker than this one at wholesale stores for half the price. This towel is too thin I'm afraid it will get limited use from each laundry. The thinness makes it feel cheap.Overall the price coupled with the thin cotton material and imperfect sewing deserves two stars at best.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RW67MGAXM5U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3R99E0#wasThisHelpful","R2RW67MGAXM5U9","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun product to have in the household. It's definitely for kids of all ages. My four year old kid is having fun playing pretend. Then when he's done, it's my turn to have some fun. I consider my hands in the Medium-Large range, and these Fists are big.What is it? It's actually simple molded fists made of soft rubbery foam material. You can probably throw punches at your Dad for making you do household errands. But do not attempt to throw punches at your Mom or sibling or these fists will disappear in no time.For the price, it's a great buy.Why not five stars? It's cheap and it's simple, but one that brings lots of laughs. The only thing lacking from getting full five stars is because the finger slots should have been built with individual inserts so they can all move independently from each other. Right now only the thumb section is separated from the rest. The remaining four fingers are stuck together so there is limited movement.It will make it more expensive, but it will make it more authentic in role play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KX43ZYVPK3OW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND5ZPLI#wasThisHelpful","R3KX43ZYVPK3OW","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not like how they used to make them.  I've been a Vornado fan for decades.WHAT I LIKE:1. I like the tactile snap on the rotating knobs that does the on/off and speed selection. It doesn't feel cheap.2. I'm also sold on the ""vortex"" concept of moving air by creating a stream of circulation versus just blowing air directly at you.3. I like the look which doesn't look like your traditional grandma's fan. If I have to own a fan, I won't be ashamed and showing off a Vornado.4. Tilting head just as all fans should be.5. Construction. Make. Durability. The plastic material doesn't feel cheap. The metal tubes will definitely than those flimsy metal tubes of other fans.6. Easy removing of grill via plastic tabs.WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:1. No more variable speed. Vornado used to make fan with variable speed selection. That was the best as it caters to virtually infinite speeds. Now you're stuck with only three typical speeds.2. Only three (3) speeds? I have a five (5) speed Vornado fan that still works like a charm. It's a trade-off for not having variable speeds. Three speeds is a joke really for something as expensive as this.3. No height adjustability. You only set a low or high height and that itself involves the extra tubing and a screwdriver. Once you have selected your speed, there is no more adjusting after-the-fact.4. Needs a remote control these days. Yes we can all easily walk at the end of the room to turn it on and adjust the speed. We can say the same for TVs. At this price it really needs a remote. You set it on one end of the room and control the ON/OFF and speed function wherever you are. No need to walk back and forth.OVERALL:I went from owning a Vornado and then thinking that by purchasing a Dyson bladeless fan was a move up. I tried to love the Dyson fan, but really couldn't get any practical use on it other than it looks cool and can belong in a modern museum display. The fans on them wasn't strong at all and was equally noisy.For the living room, I eventually replaced the Dyson and went back to purchasing this Tornado 783 stand fan. I admit it doesn't look nearly as cool as a Dyson, but this one does the job better and still produces the same amount of fan noise at high speed.I did wish Vornado improved on this fan as we hit 2014-2015, but was sad to see it was even more dumbed down with no variable speed, only three speeds, and still no remote control function. And at over $100+, it only deserves 3 stars at this day and age.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R247GSP18QJZB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E5XNAK#wasThisHelpful","R247GSP18QJZB8","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up with snacks like Pocky biscuit sticks. I was excited to see that they finally jumped on the matcha green tea flavour bandwagon. Better late than never.If you're not a fan of matcha green teat taste, then this flavour isn't for you. Unlike other snacks that claims it's matcha flavour (calling Kit Kat) but basically drowns it with milk and sugar, this one definitely has a stronger taste of matcha in every bite.It's a bit of a change from the usual chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry variety.

Of course each monitor is of different calibration so I can't blame the mistake on others. I kept the shirt as the fit is perfect. The trim tape accent is very subtle you'll have to do a double take.

But a simple pull of the tether in front will release the seat for easy transport. I also got the leather seating option because although you can almost easily remove the cover, I'd rather wipe any minor spills without having to worry about it soaking through the material like my previous car seats.Not to mention the padding for the bum is thicker than any booster seat I've seen.

"Like most of you, I've grown tired of constantly purchasing Gillette safety razors year after year. I thought each update of their razor would bring a better shaving experience. Perhaps. But still the razor blades would dull faster than you can afford to replace. I've been a Proglide user for years. Last year I was given a free Proglide Flexball. It didn't offer a revolutionary shaving experience. And the next catch of course is to continuously purchase the cartridges.So when my cartridges ran out I refused to purchase another set. Then I came across users of old-school razors.Then I thought to myself, if I were to make the switch and since the cheap blades will pay for the actual razor over time I might as well purchase a more expensive Merkur. So I looked at the Merkur Vision and Futur line. Especially the gold ones. I read the reviews and they all liked it because it was a Merkur not to mention the modern styling. But the complaints looked valid. The fatigue on the metal. The ability to change blades. The question it will last long.And that's how I ended up with the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor 34C.PROS:1. Perfect weight. As the others have stated, you let the weight of the razor work for you rather than use it to press against your skin.2. Great size. The short handle for beginners like myself allow greater control over the razor.3. Awesome construction. All metal. I want to pass this on to my son not for being a cheapskate, but for sentimental value. I will teach him to shave with this razor.4. Easy blade handling. It's not as easy as the butterfly opening of other razors, but the two piece construction allows the blade to be grasped and changed safely. No balancing of the blades or mis-alignment as the blade will sit securely on the top part and you can just drop the whole handle on it with the centre guide. After which you screw it back on.5. Simple. No complicated adjustments to allow any metal to stress and break.CONS:1. The included Merkur blade to get you started isn't something to sing about. I find it a bit dull and I will be looking for something sharper, but still for beginners like myself. Possibly the Astra blades before I move up to the Feather blades.2. No protective cap. I wish Merkur provides a plastic protective cap to allow me to transport while on the road. A simple one similar to toothbrush caps will be best.OVERALL:I'm very satisfied with this razor blade. I'm glad I didn't go splurging like I normally do for a more expensive model. I was even thinking of this 34C in gold plating, but I also read reviews of the gold plate chipping and fading away which will make it look cheap. I want something that will look old school and last just like those without the tacky upgrades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPI1C90WVV984/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QYEK88#wasThisHelpful","RPI1C90WVV984","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would never have imagined to want a laminator for the home especially in this day and age. However, it appears with the digital age where printed photo preservation isn't the goal, I find myself looking for a laminator for my family's travel needs (luggage tags), kid's projects, as well as the occasional certificate preservation.INITIAL IMPRESSIONI have to be honest I was expecting a more compact device as well as one probably with a hefty metal shell. Why not? It heats up. I was surprised to find a unit as big as the box it was packaged. While the shell feels like cheap plastic that there are tiny cracks and the edges aren't smooth. So I had to remind myself how relatively cheap this gadget costs.USE:Visual imperfections aside, it's very simple to use and works with almost any laminator pouches readily available from Amazon or elsewhere for way less than $0.20 a piece. You turn it on. The red light turns on. Then wait for the green part to light up to indicate it's ready state. It's not advertised in the box, but wait time to heat the elements is a whopping 4 minutes. Doesn't seem long, but at this day and age is surprisingly too slow.You simply insert the paper to be laminated into the laminate pouch. Then you insert the whole pouch with the sealed edge first to ensure the top and bottom align properly and are fused together bubble-free. The roller latches on and brings it out the other side in under two minutes for an 8.5x11 film.The largest width this can take is letter size (A4).PROS:1. Cheap price2. Easy to use3. Auto shut off after 30 minutes4. Jam release leverCONS:1. Bulky2. Cheap plastic shell. Would have preferred better quality plastic or even a metal shell.3. 4 minute wait time to heat up the element4. Plastic jam release lever looks fragile5. Tiny plastic cracks for visual imperfectionOVERALLWell you do get what you pay for. It's not the most elegant home laminator I've expected, but at $30.00 there really isn't something to complain about at this point. I would happily pay a few dollars more for a metal shell casing or one with high quality plastics,  a more compact design, and half the time to get things going.Other than that, this is cheap and does the job done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9L5T0FD5YCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM7WTFS#wasThisHelpful","R3F9L5T0FD5YCK","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Linksys has released a wave of Wi-Fi Range Extenders including this latest N600 Pro model RE4100W. Not to be confused with the older model RE4000W under the same name. Both have very similar features. The only main difference is that the older one had dual fast ethernet ports, while this newer revision has only one fast ethernet port with the second port featuring an audio out port so you can stream wireless audio signal to your receiver or powered speakers.SETUP is easy and just like any other Wi-Fi device. You simply power it on and wait for the solid green light to indicate it's ready. You can either use the WPS mode or for more control you connect to it via your computer browser by accessing the default 192.168.1.1 address. From there you simply follow the on-screen set up instructions so you can connect this extender to your router.I did not experience any setup difficulty. No problems trying to connect with my existing router. I went through the whole step by step procedure on the browser and after the final restart, it was good to go.To ensure maximum benefit you would want to have the extender positioned midway between your router and the area without Wi-Fi. That means having 50% of your routers Wi-Fi signal available. That means don't expect miracles to happen. The wireless speed has already decreased at this point, but the extender will attempt to boost and salvage what it has picked up.FEATURES:- Simultaneous Dual-Band - 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz.- Data Rate up to 600 Mbps (up to N300+N300 Mbps) - each band is allocated 300Mbps where 2.4Ghz has 300 and 5Ghz has another 300.- Compatible with 802.11 a/b/g/n - please note this is not AC capable as with newer smart phones and tablets.- One (1) 10/100 Fast Ethernet port with auto MDIX sensing - although Gigabit ethernet is the norm, this product speed will not be able to use it so a fast ethernet port makes sense.- One (1) Audio Port - The extender allows you to stream music on your network and play on speakers through the audio port. Just connect a mini audio jack from this extender to your receiver or powered speakers.- Two (2) spatial streams - This allows the extender to have two data streams communicate at the same time (i.e. communicating with the router and communicating with the device connected to the extender all done simultaneously. This is versus the older models where you have to technically wait until one is done communicating before it communicates with the next device.- Wi-Fi Protected Setup Wireless Security- Cross-Band Technology - Maximizes simultaneous use of both bands for high speed data transfer and uninterrupted streaming and gaming.- Up to 7500 sq ft coverage. This is the featured coverage bearing in mind no obstacles. Any other obstacles like walls and other Wi-Fi signals in the area and it begins to limit.OVERALL:I was excited to have this not as a Range Extender, but for it's audio out port so I can transmit wireless audio signal from the iPhone/iPad to this Extender and then onto the receiver. It does not disappoint in this area. As a Mac user, it showed up just like any other AirPlay device on my iPhone. I select this Extender and then stream music from iTunes.It's just too bad at this price they have not equipped this extender with the latest AC wireless capability and hence, no existence of a gigabit Ethernet port either. The price would have been extremely justified then.If you really wanted to extend your wireless signal and have a 7,500 square feet home then you should have the capability of wiring the home than relying on wireless to boost your router signal. Your second option is to have a Powerline AV extender where you plug one end to your AC socket and the other end to your source. If all else fails due to wiring, this wireless extender will work. Of course at this point, don't expect fast communication as you have already essentially split your signal.For what it is, it works and as advertised in a simple set up experience with no experience of hiccups during the process.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZE7T0X0WTXGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSSCAZE#wasThisHelpful","R2ZE7T0X0WTXGF","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stating one has the ""ultimate"" keyboard case is calling attention into itself to be judged in the ultimate way. The Belkin QODE Ultimate Keyboard Case for iPad Air 2 is a great case for sure, but it is not the ultimate.PROS:1. Great construction.TOP PART - The top part - the shell casing where you snap in the iPad Air 2 - is high quality plastic. It's tough build with smooth construction.- There is a rubber backing in the center to protect your iPad from being scratched as you open and close the case. It has an interesting texture similar to felt. While the outer part of this rubber layer is covered with faux leather.- As with any other case, there are cutouts for the controls and the camera. Just make sure you are purchasing the correct case version for the correct iPad model or it won't line up properly.BOTTOM PART- The bottom portion is what makes this case expensive because the outer shell casing is mostly made of aluminum along with the bluetooth electronics that couples to your iPad as you hammer in your keystrokes.- The keys are plastic, but of high quality feel and have a familiar short stroke feel of the Apple keyboards. The spacing is surprisingly generous and almost equal in spacing with my MacBook Pro 13"" keyboard. They tightened it up a bit especially at the ends. Otherwise, typing on it feels very familiar if you're already a keyboard Mac user.2. Easy ON / OFF- Turning on the keyboard is just as simple as flipping the case open and letting the top part rest on the bottom part via the built in magnets. There are three resting places to suit your viewing angle. Just align the cover to any of the three markings and the magnet will do the rest.- To turn off, just remove from the magnet. No unnecessary power button. Smart and simple.3. Charging via common Micro-USB cable- The micro USB port is located on the right side of the keyboard. Just use the included USB to micro-USB cable and plug into any USB capable charger.4. Magnetic opening and closing between the top and bottom part.CONS:1. A bit heavy.- For a keyboard case made of aluminum, it is nice and classy but it does add weight to the feather light iPad Air 2. Yes it can be expected whenever you add an accessory, but this is a really have accessory that may be a love / hate extreme point of view.2. Aluminum bottom shell- Because the bottom part is made of aluminum, it will eventually dent and scratch over time. Of course it's better to put the wear and tear on this case than the actual iPad, but for $130.00 it may be a bit harder to swallow still.3. Top and Bottom part cannot be detached- This is my biggest pet peeve of the case and the reason I cannot give it a perfect 5 stars even if I overlook the other flaws. Accidents may happen as well as wear and tear. So if the rubber top part splits and tears over time from strain on the material, it doesn't appear to be user replaceable. You'd want to salvage the bottom part most especially being the driving force on the price. And in this case, you would want the option to be able to replace the top part yourself. Even exchange it for other colors to express your individuality. At this time you're stuck with choosing a black case or a white case which means the top cover is black or white. Why not offer being able to replace the top with a multitude of colors. This will give better life to the keyboard and will enable them to recycle the bottom.OVERALLSo you see to call it the ultimate keyboard case is too much. Ultimate in price most likely, but they do have a tough competition with another keyboard maker for the iPad which is Zagg. You can't go wrong with any of these manufacturers. I just wish they actually offer a well thought of case if they are to offer it at this price and then call it the ultimate one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16O2MUIM0POIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTDTNLE#wasThisHelpful","R16O2MUIM0POIM","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A good toy from Fisher-Price for your future rocker. For the price, the plastic quality and construction is nothing to complain about. This is for my baby girl, but my 4 year old boy also occasionally likes pretending to strum along to it.It's a great purchase if your daughter knows the TV character, Dora.PROS:1. Two ways to produce sound - acoustic or electric - by flipping the lid up or down.2. Various phrases and music are played.3. Good quality plastic for the cheap price.CONS:1. A bit hefty and can be tiring to carry for the little ones.2. Volume is not adjustable and can be annoyingly loud.3.

"For this particular price range, this is one of the best headphones I've owned. Like many of you looking for accurate headphones, I've gone through quite a few from Sennheisers and the likes to Sony and the likes. Some sound good, others over equalized. There is also the issue of the fit on the head. Some can be uncomfortably tight especially when worn over long periods of time, while others a bit awkward with pressure points.COMFORTOf course fit is subjective and will depend on the shape of one's head, but this headphone for me feels just right. I have a medium-large head and it's very comfortable after having been broken into after wearing a couple of short times.This is not for active wear please, so don't think you can go exercising around with it. What this headphone is made for is extended wear even for hours if you have to. Either commuting on a plane or because of your work demand like audio and video production.The padding on the ears and on the head sits just right. There is adequate amount of pressure to clamp on your ears, but not annoyingly tight like the other headphones I've owned. It simply rests easy on my head.FIT AND FINISHI've been pleasantly surprised with the production quality of these headphones. These are high quality plastics that don't look or feel cheap to the touch. There is definitely some weight to the headphones.Even the faux leather padding on the ears and head feel soft on the skin.Construction feels tight. Handling it on a frequent basis on and off the head, rotating the earpiece, and removing the wire all perform nicely.SOUND QUALITYThis is where the headphone particularly shines. However for young generation looking for the ""cool-looking"" headphones, please don't compare this to your Bose, Beats, Urban Ears, etc. These are not your over-equalized, over-emphasize treble and bass, made to impress the eyes headphones.I've seen people write to ask how this compares to the above headphones. Or complain there isn't enough bass. Or even the oldies complaining there's too much bass. Sigh. Let me get this straight. These Audio Technica ATH-M50x headphones was created to reproduce your audio source as accurately as possible. There is no bass enhancing passive or active equalization to make you pretend the source sounds like candy to the ears.These are meant to have a flatter frequency (any more flat and you're delving on $500 and above price range). That way there are no added surprises or disappointments. What your source gives, it will simply reproduce.Of course this also depends on your device powering the headphones. The better the quality of the amplifier and signal path, the less distortion and more sonic quality will reach your ears.SPECSThese are efficient 45mm drivers at 98db sensitivity with a range of 15Hz - 28,000Hz. So unless you're one of the lucky few that can hear beyond the normal human range. Or you're a lucky dog with you're owner giving you a pair, then these headphones are more than adequate to provide you the necessary tools for accurate listening of your source.OVERALLI listen to a variety of audio on a couple of studio monitors. This headphone plays along quite well when transitioning from studio monitors to wearing the headphones and back. Usually your ears will need to be accustomed to the changes, but in my case both are reproducing the audio sources with no further adjustment.My first purchase was the limited edition BLUE model with TAN padding that reminded me of Hermes. My wife kept on taking it away from my desk.So I decided to buy another one this time in WHITE. She wouldn't touch that one and said it's all mine laughing they looked like ear muffs for the Winter. I agree the colour is not too impressive despite white being the ""in"" colour in everything with Apple products dominating the market. In this case, the white on these headphones are a bit too much since it's a big piece of head gear. Even my 4 year old who uses the blue for his iPad didn't want to touch the white saying it was for his sister.BLACK on the other hand is just too plain there has to be a bit more of a two-tone accent or a change in hue. With that said I am excited with the new limited edition GREEN with BROWN padding. Definitely brings class to this headphone line just like the BLUE/TAN predecessor.If you're looking for headphones that don't scream newbie, but simply get the respect among audio enthusiasts and audio engineers, this is the one to get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1OC6634UG86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVLUSGM#wasThisHelpful","RH1OC6634UG86","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price, I had high expectations for this product and especially for this company. From the photos, it looks awesome. In person it equally looks as stunning and will fit any modern home or office space.FIRST IMPRESSIONSThe lines are smooth. The construction has a very tight tolerance. If Apple were to design and create a portable Bluetooth audio speaker, this is what I could have imagined they will create. The quality of the plastics is top notch. I did a double take thinking the fascia was aluminum. Of course it isn't. That would be reserved for the higher priced Braven 850 - which is essentially the exact model of this Braven 805 with the addition of the silver aluminum fascia which essentially mimics the old Power Mac G5 desktop.Even the packaging is nice. Apart from the actual Bluetooth speaker, it comes with a power adapter with interchangeable international plugs to ensure you can plug it into just about any socket around the world. There is a mini stereo jack to connect practically any device that has an audio output to connect into the AUX port.Buttons have a nice touch. Very high quality. It would have been better if there was a bit more snap when pressing to create a better ""click"" as feedback. There is a subtle click right now which is good enough so it's a matter of preference at this point.PROS1. 2 x 10W speaker drivers (20W total output) + 2 x passive radiators at the rear2. Built-in microphone + speakerphone so you can pause your music and answer all in one3. SRS WOW HD by DTS to enhance treble (high) and bass (low). It's added equalization on steroids.4. Built-in 4400mAh rechargeable lithium-ion battery giving the bluetooth speakers an 18-hour playtime and the ability to recharge your mobile phone or tablet (keep in mind there is a maximum of 1AMP so larger power hungry devices may not charge at all). If you do so then the playtime will obviously be less.5. USB charging port to take advantage of the built-in li-ion battery.6. 3.5mm stereo input for old devices that cannot connect via wireless Bluetooth pairing7. 5 LED lights to indicate charge level (reminds me of the MacBook LED lights on the side as well that does the same)8. Lastly and best of all is the ability to pair another for true stereo imaging. I have owned two similar portable Bluetooth speakers and none can be linked together to create that true stereo. This one can. Finally!CONS1. This model is not meant for portability as that would be their outdoor line, but a retractable handle or notch at the rear would be good for easy handling. Right now it's so slick there is a possibility of dropping if moving to clean or transport from room to room.2. Audio feedback to power ON / OFF, pairing mode, turning on SRS WOW HD mode, and when maximum volume has been reached is too loud and is tiring to hear. There should be the ability to lower the feedback volume or mute it completely.3. With all the loud audio feedback, I'm surprised they do not have feedback for whenever the volume button is pressed except for the fact that the volume is getting softer / louder. But at least LED lights to confirm the input has been acknowledged as well as a few lights to tell me how near or far I am from maximum. I actually had to count the number of steps from zero to max volume and there are 32. So really at this point a few LED lights to indicate min to max is being reached (I don't need all 32 LEDs, but just an indication on how far than none at all at this stage).4. The 5 LED for the battery indicator needs to stay on while charging so I know how near I am to having it done. All it has is a single blinking light to show it's charging which stops blinking once done. But how near is it to being done? How much capacity has it reached recharging? As of right now on my version 1 unit, the LEDs do not report the state of charge in real time except only when I power ON the unit. It will show me the number of LEDs then the lights will turn off. I will have to constantly press the battery charge button to see how many LEDs are lit. I understand this is to conserve battery, but not in the case when the unit is plugged to the AC where it is probably charging.This is also true when the power is OFF. I cannot simply press on the battery charging button to peep how near it is to being fully charged. I will have to power ON the unit in this case. This needs to be changed.5. Buttons need better haptic feedback. A bit more snap and ""clicking"" sound to let you know your input has been received.6. Extremely poor customer support. Before receiving the unit I researched online and read the manual. I had questions so I emailed their Customer Service. I had never heard back despite a second follow up. Not even an acknowledgment that my email is being looked into and thanking me for my inquiry. If they couldn't answer or acknowledge my technical questions, how much support do I expect to receive when the unit needs service?LACKING CUSTOMER SUPPORTAs I indicated above, I emailed them on January 9. Then a follow up on January 19th. Both met with no answer to date. My questions were as follows which was not discussed in the current manual (if they update it as a result, then it's beyond what I received):-----1. What is the maximum speaker power output in Watts? It is not stated on your online specifications.- This one I actually found online. It is not EXPLICITLY stated on their product specifications then nor as of this writing. However if you go through the website you will find a mention that the speaker drivers are 10W.2. Are the internal batteries user replaceable? What is the expected number of chargers before needing to replace.- Still unknown.3. Once the batteries are fully charged, will the Braven 805 shut off further charging of the batteries? Such that can you leave the AC plugged continuously (i.e. forever) instead of using the internal batteries all the time?- This would be helpful to know.4. When you leave the AC plugged, will this signal the Braven 805 to use that power source instead of the internal batteries and will this help use AC to power the unit as well as power the USB for the device being charged instead of the internal batteries?- I would like to know.-----SO HOW DOES IT SOUND?In spite of the above, the unit and the sound quality just speaks for itself how much the company had put into their product. This is second to none and the price in this case justifies the results. It is very classy and I would be proud to show off the Braven 805. I have the black/black which will fit any room, but they do have a total of 9 distinctive popping colors to match your own style.Turning on the SRS WOW HD is a matter of personal taste. I find this too much of an artificial boost in treble and bass it becomes fatiguing to my ears. This is no audiophile speaker, but it's not a slouch in performance in being a portable unit. It has a pleasant sound output (when in non SRS WOW HD mode) that isn't distorted. The over equalization with the SRS can be annoying depending on your music genre, but I'm pretty sure the younger generation will love this and compare it to their Beats or Bose.As I mentioned above these aren't audiophile or studio monitor speakers so please don't try to compare the quality of sound output in this regard as these have different applications. There is some slight distortion and the sound isn't perfect. But among Bluetooth portable speakers the sound here is top notch. When I'm at a patio or beach, I'm not aiming for accurate listening. I am however aiming for rich audio output that won't put my music selection to shame.Of the previous two I have owned, I highly recommend this Bluetooth speaker above all. Construction and sound output, it's the one I'm most proud of to have.If only for their lack in customer support, I would have given it a solid 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36R33QYDGKQHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1SHBOO#wasThisHelpful","R36R33QYDGKQHU","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PLEASE NOTE THIS REVIEW IS FOCUSED ON BEING ABLE TO USE THE NETGEAR NIGHTHAWK X6 AC3200 R8000 AS AN ACCESS POINT THAN A REGULAR ROUTER.PROS1. Super fast, powerful and stable.2. Three separate wireless network bands for better speed management to separate legacy wireless devices (B and G) away from the most common N devices to the latest AC equipment.3. Automatic setup via Netgear's Genie user interface that detects existing network settings.4. Fanless operation with generous airflow opening for better heat dissipation.5. Dual 1GHz processing.6. Six configurable external antennas for better placement.7. Beam forming for stronger wireless signal direction.8. Access Point ability via the WAN port, preserving the 4 LAN ports for your wired equipment.9. Available USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports for hard drives and wireless printing.10. iTunes and DLNA music server capability.CONS1. Massive and awkward size. Almost twice as big as my previous AC1900 router.2. Irreplaceable antenna.3. Super bright LED lights that can only be turned on or off instead of an adjustable brightness.4. Lacking eSATA port.5. Lacking Wireless Bridge capability (which I don't recommend, but may come in handy for others).BREAKDOWNI am impressed with the performance of this router. I was coming from a dual band D-Link DIR-880L AC1900 that was fast as well especially for the price, but I need a router at this day and age with lots of flexibility including being able to set it up as an Access Point (AP).I understand manufacturers are trying to ""dumb down"" the settings and make it more user friendly especially interface-wise. And that's fine with me. But what I don't find appealing is when they also don't give you the flexibility by hiding the advanced configuration with no access at all. This Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 router gives you the middle ground. It doesn't give too much, but it doesn't give too little.I have 20 wired and wireless devices connected to this router from a basic wireless printer, to various home automated devices that manages the lights and door lock, to a gigabit switch with load balancing to two NAS. In between are your usual smartphones, tablets and computers. Thus my need for more network speed that helps each device communicate at it's optimum without slowing down the others.Enter the Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 (R8000) Tri-Band router. Okay if you want to go technical there are only two unique bands - a 2.4GHz and a 5GHz. The third is not an entirely new bandwidth, but another 5GHz network transmission. So what you actually have are three separate networks operating independently and all communicating back to the router.The benefit of which is segregating devices according to their speed into three groups. The first group is the 2.4GHz where your legacy B, G, and even N devices will reside. The second group is for your 5GHz N and AC speeds capable of 5GHz transmission. The third group is a repeat of N and AC 5GHz transmission. So ideally the first 5GHz network is for the N devices and the second 5GHz network is for AC devices. If you don't have AC devices, yet, then you can configure the router to load balance the two 5GHz networks. That way it will assign each device into either so that the faster N devices are in one group and the slower N devices in the second group. In order to achieve this you will have to assign both 5GHz networks the same name and then click on the ""Smart Connect"" option. In this case you don't have to overthink where you want to connect each device unless you have specific needs and you know each capability.ACCESS POINTAll routers can be configured into an Access Point even if the router doesn't explicitly have a setting for it. Of course you'll need to know your cable modem IP address and subnet. You will also need the DNS of your internet provider. They usually have two addresses. I had to do this static routing option with my prior router, D-Link DIR-880L, because it didn't have any explicit setting to operate as an Access Point. That router only allows to function as a Router or a Wireless Bridge (which means it picks up the existing wireless signal and re-transmits it).In my case, I have an internet provider that supplies a cable modem with built in router and wireless transmission. I turned off the wireless transmission, but left the routing function because my home is wired with LAN ports and I made this cable modem do the routing for the home. But for the wireless aspect and other devices, I am letting this Netgear Nighthawk X6 do it's job. And do it's job it does excellently.Unlike other routers where you manually configure as an Access Point, but need to use a LAN port and not the sole WAN port, this Netgear allows you to use as an Access Point without losing a LAN port. That also means by utilizing the WAN port then it is able to detect when you are connected to the internet. When I used my old D-Link DIR-880L as an Access Point, I can definitely go on the internet but it doesn't know I'm connected to the internet. The interface annoyingly tells me that I am not connected and advices me to repair when there is nothing to repair.SETUPWith this router all I need to do is plug the ethernet wire to the WAN port, power up the router and either connect to an available LAN or join the factory Wi-Fi. Launch the browser and let the Netgear Genie take over to detect your internet connection and settings. If you want to manually configure it yourself, you can do so yourself.I tried the Genie and it was able to detect that I have an existing router in the network. So it asked if I wanted to set it as an Access Point which I did. Then it asked if I wanted it to get the IP address setting dynamically from existing router OR enable fixed IP settings on this device which means I manually input the settings which surprisingly it does not recommend. I understand the recommendation if you don't have advanced network experience. Otherwise if you have specific needs then manual input is the way to go.From there it detected the network settings and applied to the router. It will tell you to allow a few minutes before it restarts. In my case I waited a long time and it looked like it already hung. After 10 minutes, I powered down the router and powered up expecting I would repeat the process. It actually applied the settings and came back online as an Access Point.After which I fine tuned some settings to my liking under the Advanced options. The router like any router will default to Basic settings. But for advanced users there is always an Advanced menu.ISSUESIf I have an issue with the router, it's the shape and size. It's so wide it's 3/4 the size of a PS4 but does much less.Moreover although I like the placement and partial flexibility of the six external antennas, these aren't replaceable should you accidentally break any of them. So be careful.There are 13 bright led lights (power, internet, 2.4Ghz band indication, 5Ghz band 1 indication, 5GHz band 2 indication, LAN 1, LAN 2, LAN 3, LAN 4, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, WI-FI ON, WPS) which you can shut off or leave steady on than blinking during data activity. I would prefer them on but it would be better if you can adjust the brightness.OVERALLI highly recommend this router. At the top end of the router devices, there are two competing standards right now which is this so-called AC3200 that offers three separate network bands to ideally split the B and G, N, and AC devices so that they don't intermingle and effectively slow down the other. This router is SU-MIMO (Single User Multiple Input and Output). The other standard is the AC2300/2350 MU-MIMO (Multi User Multiple Input and Output). Theoretically the MU-MIMO is faster on paper because it allows up to three simultaneous users at the same time rather than all current routers actually taking turns sending and receiving data (you just don't notice this because each one takes turns in split seconds). The problem with MU-MIMO is that as attractive as it is on paper, you cannot harness the speed unless the client side (meaning your devices) is also equipped with MU-MIMO capability. And since I don't have any device that can harness this capability, the Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 is the most practical and obvious choice by providing blazing fast speed with your existing gear all by offering three separate bands like a three-lane highway to allow segregation of different speeds.Of course until the 8 antenna AC5300 Ultra Wi-Fi routers come into market later this year, this is one of the fastest available and most capable router for people with more than a dozen wireless and wired connections in their homes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26RWBWIQ3M5GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWHMR6G#wasThisHelpful","R26RWBWIQ3M5GY","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE: JANUARY 16, 2015For some odd reason this camera conflicts with the AirPlay protocol forcing the devices to reset and lose connection with the router. I thought it was my router, an Apple Airport Extreme Dual-N. So I switched to a D-Link DIR-880L AC1900 router. Still doing the same. Whenever the camera is on and connected, the AirPlay devices are kicked out every now and then.I again switched to the Netgear Nighthawk X6 R8000 AC3200 thinking this will surely solve the issue. Not at all. Still reset and loses connection from the router as a result. So today I searched for anyone else having the issue and apparently it is a known one for similar AirPlay users.It happened to the Wemo Insight as well and AirPlay but stopped with a firmware update. Now they are doing it again with the Belkin Wemo NetCam HD+. I am hoping Belkin with these reviews are addressing the problem. Once this is solved, I will update my review once again.So I am downgrading my review to 3 stars until it is fixed. Otherwise, will have to return the camera and find another one that doesn't cause issues.Belkin Netcam HD+ F5Z0559The Belkin Netcam HD+ model (take note of the ""+"" designation which is different from the Belkin HD camera) video quality is the best I've seen so far for a consumer level camera at this price. It has HD capture and transmission and equipped with glass lens for better picture quality. Those familiar with the Wemo setup will find comfort in the simplicity of this as well. You power on the Netcam, download the specific Netcam app. Connect your smartphone or tablet to the camera by specifically connecting to the wireless transmission as if you were connecting to your router. Once connected, you then launch the Netcam app and the final setup process will comment from there in which you can rename the camera (if you have multiple cameras connected around the house) as well as change settings.There is a two-way push to talk feature via the app. To hear audio feed, you will have to always turn it on each and every time you launch the app. There should be an app setting to know if you want default on or off.

The app itself will inform you of the update.However for better features including cloud storage, you will need to sign up for a monthly ($9.99) or yearly ($99) to harness it's full capability.

Which is where the convenience of monthly cloud storage fee kicks in.FINAL THOUGHTSI can't give this 5 stars. The lacking feature for the Belkin HD+ camera compared to other lower priced competitor cloud cameras are as follows:- Lacking Pan and Tilt function. It has a wide angle lens, but a pan/tilt ability will make this camera with HD transmission a winner.- Lacking On and Off remote switch in itself so you can turn it on and off within the Wemo app. I had to pair it with a Wemo Switch to be able to turn it on and off remotely.- Lack of SD card slot for your own storage capability rather than be forced to sign up with their cloud service.- They should incorporate this webcam straight into the Wemo app without having to launch another Netcam app the way it is doing now. Similar to the Wemo Insight that has added monitoring features but already built into the Wemo app itself. This way you have one solid Wemo ecosystem.Also Belkin did not actively market in the packaging nor on the instructions that they have a remote viewing via a web browser the way competitor cloud cameras are highlighting. I can only surmise they have been pressured into building a Netcam viewing platform over the web which I have accidentally found so they can compete with the other consumer cloud cameras that offer no fee viewing. I can log on with the sign up details I set up through the Netcam app, but unfortunately it looks like a beta stage at this point and again as of this writing because it cannot work with the latest Flash plug in which if you are technologically savvy (the fact that you buy into these products) your software are all updated by now.Until all these have been addressed, I am putting my hopes up for this Belkin platform that they are able to offer updates sooner than later they way they have addressed their Wemo products.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5SZHXBKCP9G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNM763E#wasThisHelpful","R5SZHXBKCP9G5","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm liking this value combo pack from Belkin. I was pleased that the included Belkin F5Z0559 Netcam HD+ camera is incorporated into the Wemo ecosystem. Clicking into the Wemo app launches the specific Belkin Netcam app (once you have downloaded it to your smartphone) in order to view as a cloud camera.Individually priced as of this writing the camera is purported to retail at $129.99 and the Belkin Wemo Insight at $59.99. So as a package you are saving quite a lot (theoretically). However if you do search from retailers online you can find a deal as well. If you need both, then this is a no brainer package to purchase.It is also worth noting that Belkin is offering a cheaper Belkin HD+ camera and Wemo Switch combo package, but if you can find this more expensive combo package on sale then might as well get the one with the Wemo Insight.I was able to get this even cheaper on sale at a wholesale store and that's a great deal in itself.Belkin Netcam HD+ F5Z0559As for the Belkin Netcam HD+ model (take note of the ""+"" designation which is different from the Belkin HD camera), the video quality is the best I've seen so far for a consumer level camera at this price. It has HD capture and transmission and equipped with glass lens for better picture quality. Those familiar with the Wemo setup will find comfort in the simplicity of this as well. You power on the Netcam, download the specific Netcam app. Connect your smartphone or tablet to the camera by specifically connecting to the wireless transmission as if you were connecting to your router.

Which is where the convenience of monthly cloud storage fee kicks in.Wemo InsightPlaying into the original Wemo remote switches, this has been in the market for quite some time and has their share of bugs over the few short years I've owned a Wemo. This specific model does the same remote switching of the outlet through the specific Wemo app no matter where you are in the world. The only addition to this model is it gives you an ""insight"" as to the power draw of the component plugged into the Wemo Insight. You will be able to view your consumption through the Wemo app.I chose this Belkin model because I have over two years built a home around the Wemo ecosystem from their first offering and then clunky Wemo Switch and Wemo Motion. To their Wemo Light Switch. All of which have gone through numerous firmware updates as well Wemo app updates. Early users like myself were frustrated then, but I'm happy to report the Wemo products and app has become more stable and responsive of late thanks to their updates.I don't really need the Wemo Insight specifically as I'm not obsessed to know what my power consumption is for a specific appliance. But what I do need and what I (sadly) use the Wemo Insight for is just as a remote on/off switch for the included Belkin HD+ camera - because the oversight of this camera is not having a remote switch in itself. So strangely enough it fits into the Belkin Wemo ecosystem, but is not able to power on or off itself remotely. So what I do is just plug the Wemo Insight to the outlet then plug the Belkin HD+ into the Wemo Insight. That way when I am home and I don't need to monitor myself, I turn the camera off. When I am away from home and need to monitor my kids and the Nanny caring for my kids, I simply remotely power on the Wemo Insight. After a minute, the camera powers itself on and appears operable through both the Wemo app and Netcam app.FINAL THOUGHTSNo matter how good of a package this Belkin is at it's price especially when on sale at the Wholesale store, I can't give this 5 stars. The lacking feature for the Belkin HD+ camera compared to other lower priced competitor cloud cameras is as follows:- Lacking Pan and Tilt function. It has a wide angle lens, but a pan/tilt ability will make this camera with HD transmission a winner.- Lacking On and Off switch in itself- Lack of SD card slot for your own storage capability rather than be forced to sign up with their cloud service- They should incorporate this webcam straight into the Wemo app without having to launch another Netcam app the way it is doing now.

"For the price of this Pro model, I honestly would have expected more build quality. When picking up the unit I didn't expect to feel so much plastic and fake chrome siding. Other than that, the display is pretty simple and straightforward.- There is a power button.- The temperature readout is shown.-There are left and right arrows to basically scroll through the 1 to 4 probes you may have connected.All of this is operated by 2 x AA batteries that are supplied by the manufacturer so you can get going right out of the box. Acclaimed battery life is a cool 200 hours which is more than enough if you plan on cooking by smoking.Once powered up you can use it as is. But the shining moment of this unit and the reason you're paying for it is the advanced Bluetooth Smart 4.0 built in which you download the app to your iOS or Android smartphone and tablet. From there you can monitor the meat and cooking temperature up to 150 feet away. You set grilling temperatures and get alerts once this has been achieved or even an alarm when minimum and maximum temperatures have been achieved.Out of the box, it comes with two pro grilling meat probes which is adequate for a household. If you have different levels of doneness then you simply remove and re-poke the probe to the next meat cooking longer. Otherwise this unit can take up to four probes which is essential if you really want to monitor each meat. The pro meat probes measures temperatures between -22F and 572F. This means it can measure ambient temperature especially if you like to smoke your meat.However for more accurate ambient readings, iDevices is selling extra probes including a specialized pro ambient probe which comes with a rounded tip and a grate clip so you can position the probe right next to the meat without poking. To poke into the meat, you will want to simultaneously use the pro meat probe with the sharp ends. Cost is $25.00 per probe. Please don't buy from unauthorized sources as this company had old probes with voluntary recall due to melting of the silicone on the probes.The iGrill 2 comes with a rubber mount that has a magnetic base so it can attach to your oven or griller. It can also be positioned 180 degrees facing up or down depending on your viewing and grilling position.The probes are multicolored and the case they each come with actually snap together for easy organization.The app itself is a little bit iffy in operation where my iPhone says it's connected to the iGrill 2, but the app itself states there is no unit connected. This was after pairing the two together. I connected the probes and it says no probes connected. While I downloaded it to my iPad and there was no issue connecting this time and reading the probes from any of the four terminals. By the way, make sure you download the correct app as the manufacturer has an iGrill app for older units. The correct app is the iDevices built for the iGrill 2.My gripe in not giving this 5 stars is because for a ""pro"" device and for the price, they could have built the actual unit with a bit more heft and weight to it with heavy duty plastics and actual chrome metal rings.Also it would have been nice to have an AC powered option for indoor use.If they can update the iOS app to fix the bugs and stability issue then this latest iGrill2 can deserve a higher rating.Other than that this is the device to get for the high tech grilling lifestyle these days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN57KNR9A4127/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC4KU42#wasThisHelpful","RN57KNR9A4127","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to impress your child or your friend's children, this is the gift to give this year. It's big. It's hefty. It's Baymax!The plastic material is substantial. Baymax is heavy. If I were a child I would find this toy awesome.For a big, clunky Baymax the posable ability of this toy was done well. The elbow is tight so it stay into any position. While the knees part clicks which helps when you want to make him stand on his own. Baymax has small feet so the weight of this toy helps him stand up just fine without being wobbly or clumsy to place into position.A great plus is that this toy is electronic. He has an on/off position at the back and a subtle button by his chest. Like any decent toy manufacturer, batteries are included. Pressing on the button makes his helmet part light up and he makes robotic sounds. When you attach Hiro to his back, pressing on the button again will make him begin to talk. With Hiro still attached to his back, if you put Baymax into flying position he will make various flying sounds (similar to the flying Grover doll).There are two more buttons. One button at his back will make him spread his gigantic wings. The other button by his left arm will enable Baymax to shoot his hand. Because of the weight of the hand alone, it really won't go far out. But it's a good addition to the toy.So why only four stars? Well my issue is with the Hiro figurine. They planned it out well with Baymax, but it seems they half-heartedly included Hiro in this set just for the sake of it.For one he isn't posable at all. He's in an awkward position ready to be strapped in the back. You can't really play with him alone and move his arms, legs, and head just like a regular figurine.Second, attaching him to Baymax isn't strong and can be disappointing at times. He easily falls down so playing with him attached to Baymax isn't too exciting. Yes he has magnets on his hands to activate Baymax and attach to the back. But they should have gave the figurine stronger magnets on the hands and knees so it can attach just by magnet. You don't need to align it exactly and the plastic pegs that he has right now doesn't loosen up.So I am knocking down one star because of this mis-step in construction. Otherwise, it could have been a perfectly awesome toy to play with for the child or the child in you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R834HQMRTKSJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1YC920#wasThisHelpful","R834HQMRTKSJF","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Star Wars Command Star Destroyer set comes with the following:1. Star Destroyer space ship2. Remote Control3. Four (4) pcs plastic missile ball4. One (1) Metallic-painted Darth Vader5. One (1) Gold-painted Luke Skywalker6. Three (3) Storm Troopers7. Three (3) Rebel SoldiersThe only assembly required is for the Star Destroyer space ship which is an easy snap on. After which there are a few creative ways to play with this Star Wars Command set even without the required batteries.Your child can simply play with the plastic figurines alone. They are molded plastic that aren't posable. These are similar to the classic green Toy Soldiers Army Men. Nothing exciting here, but plain old imagination.One can play with the Star Destroy space ship without batteries. To be able to fully use as intended, then you are required 4 x AA batteries for the space ship and 2 x AA batteries for the controller. None are supplied. Despite that they recommend Duracell which is a turn off in marketing. If they recommend a certain type of battery, please supply it as well.To operate the remote, there are hand movements to learn. One to make it go forward, another for reverse, and then finally to shoot the green transparent plastic balls.What your child does is set up the figures and he puts them into line of sight for the spaceship to fire upon.The quality of the pieces are what's expected from a known manufacturer like Hasbro.The gameplay is another matter. Without posable figures, it gets boring. The construction of the space ship is fine, but the construction of the figures is plain lazy. Yes, you get Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader that have metallic painting that grown ups will appreciate to collect. For the actual child they could care less.For that reason and for the lack in supplied batteries doesn't make this too attractive to purchase for it's given price. It's an okay toy to probably give without having to think further. But for my son, he just moved on after less than an hour of play.Your milage of course will vary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TPTHD61SH8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILA2766#wasThisHelpful","R30TPTHD61SH8B","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This WB-120 Wall-Mount Kit is specially made for the Bose CineMate 120 Home Theater System. This simple two piece metal bracket understandably is not included because not everyone has decided to wall mount their TV and hence their sound bar.One metal piece goes into the soundbar via the included screws. The other metal piece goes on the wall also via included drywall mount screws. However if you really want a solid setup on your drywall, I would suggest using a better quality drywall hardware package to ensure your drywall screws doesn't get loose and fall out over time.Once connected to each piece - the wall and the soundbar - all you need to do is hang the soundbar metal over the metal connected to the wall. There is a rubber piece you stick to the metal so the soundbar plastic doesn't get damaged from the metal or vibrate annoyingly if you put it to the test.So why only four stars? Everything is included including the annoying template all manufacturers fall into. They supply you with the convenient paper template for you to cut out. Unless you have an awesome paper cutter or a robot hand, you will never be able to cut the template straight.When manufacturers supply you with a wall mounting template, I demand these to be pre-cut already and actually printed on a hard cardboard sheet. Not on a paper for you to manhandle and attempt to cut straight.Like all paper templates, I skip using these and actually use the actual speaker measurements and screw height measurements. I then use the wall markers and finally a leveler to ensure proper vertical and horizontal installation.With the quality that Bose is injecting into their image, I wish they can improve their template and actually give owners who are demanding a Bose hassle-free installation the same ease in wall mounting their products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KA6BWNQ7ONXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O66Q2LA#wasThisHelpful","R2KA6BWNQ7ONXM","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE SEPTEMBER 29, 2015:So Bose releases the SoundTouch 120 which is actually just this CineMate 120 plus the addition of the SoundTouch Adapter in the box. All it means is that you don't have to buy them separately. At the same time Bose dropped the pricing of the CineMate 120 to below $1K and then priced the SoundTouch 120 to the previous pricing of the CineMate 120.The odd thing is that at their current pricing you can actually save more by buying the CineMate 120 and SoundTouch Adapter separately than buying the SoundTouch 120. Either way, they are the same system.UPDATE AUGUST 29, 2015:Signal Cutting Off With The Acoustimass Module Every Few SecondsI failed to provide an update sooner, but around two months ago I resolved an issue I've been having. The Bose CineMate 120 is now positioned in a small apartment less than 900 square feet. Everything is wired to the internet from the audio and video equipment, the LED lights, the wall switches, internet camera and motion monitoring, down to the door locks. The main router that's handling all these wired and wireless signal is the Netgear Nighthawk X6 R8000 AC3200. It's a powerful beast that it may be conflicting with the wireless signal of the Bose Acoustimass Module such that the sound is cutting off every few seconds.I called Bose customer support and described the issue and they knew exactly what I was talking about. They suggested I first change where my router is setup, but I told them this was not possible because of the size of the apartment and that everything in the house is transmitting wireless signal anyway.They mailed me a mini coaxial cable that you connect from the Bose receiver to the Bose Acoustimass. So instead of a wireless transmission that is always disrupted by the other wireless signals around the home, it's now a traditional wired speaker which I don't mind. The sound doesn't cut out any longer and I am more than happy with the solution and customer support.I only wish they provided this cable from the get go and part of their FAQ as it doesn't cost much and will help people with the same issue not return the Bose product altogether.SETUP:Bose has carefully and thoughtfully packaged the CineMate 120 so each content can be pulled out in an orderly way from one box with the console, the other box with the accessories - remote, speaker cables, power cables, and HDMI cable. Then the next layer is the carefully packaged soundbar. The bottom layer is the acoustimass module.As you unpack, I would suggest setting up each to your location of choice as your remove the plastic wrapping. That way you can just route and connect the speaker and power cable wiring to each component.POWER UP:Once the cabling is done and the placement of your components are all set, it's time to power up the console and the acoustimass module. The sound bar is powered by the main console on behalf of the proprietary Bose speaker wiring that connects to it. While the acoustimass module has it's own power source and communicates via wireless. Although placement of the bass module can be anywhere within 30 feet of the console, I would suggest placing it as close to the sound bar as possible so there is no disconnect with the perception. I will touch on this more later.ADAPTIQ:Adaptiq is Bose's own term for their audio calibration process. This is your first order of business to ensure optimum speaker performance based on your room size, wall, furniture and drapery placement. You just plug in the minijack to the side of the console and wear the Adaptiq headset.It essentially takes five measurements based on where the five people in your household will be sitting.This process is similar to my existing THX home receiver that does auto calibration for best audio performance. Both shoot out high and low pitch tones to measure the speaker output and your room environment. The only difference is that Bose forces you to take five measurements than is necessary. Unlike my home theater set up by the living room. This Bose CineMate 120 I have placed in the bedroom. So I really have an audience of 2 most of the time with maximum of 4, if ever. I think the least Bose can do is give you an option to add more or do less measurements than force you to find five positions. Because mine is in the bedroom, how many listening positions do I really want on my bed. I can think of more than five positions in the bed, but not with the Adaptiq. Thank you.So once the five measurements are done, it's time to start connecting your sources if you have not done so already.CONNECTIONS and ARC (Audio Return Channel):My Bose console is mainly connected to my 2012 Samsung LED TV. It's worth noting that if you have sources directly connected to your TV instead of the Bose console, then you should select the HDMI port on your TV with the ARC (Audio Return Channel) capability. This means that any source that plays on your TV will route it's audio to the Bose via the same HDMI cable that you connected from the Bose console to the TV. This is unlike the old days where you needed to feed a separate audio cable from the TV to your receiver in order to hear audio that the TV is playing. If you don't have media sources connected to your TV directly then this is not a concern. Or rather the work-around is to connect them to the Bose console than the TV.The problem for me is that because the Bose console is too limited in function other than being an audio playback device for four HDMI sources, I have to play my other digital sources stored in a USB stick and hard drive via USB connection to the 2012 TV that can handle playing these various media. That way the TV plays the media then feeds the audio back to Bose.HDMI-CEC / ARC issues:That's not to say the ARC feature isn't perfect and I don't know who's fault it is at this point - Bose or Samsung. For one there is a set up in Bose's console that times out the console if no audio is playing for some time, with ARC via Samsung it plays the audio then eventually shuts off the audio. This means I'm listening to the Bose audio at one point then when the console shuts off automatically because it thinks there is no audio (oddly enough) then the audio goes back to the Samsung TV. The workaround for me is to disable the auto shutoff on the Bose console and it will play the ARC audio from the Samsung TV just fine for hours.The second issue for me is that there is an annoying Samsung display stating their ARC (or what they also bill the feature under their Anynet+ branding) is routing to the Bose CineMate. Sometimes it will appear for a few seconds then disappear completely. But other times it will flicker on and off continuously. It's very annoying. So clearly Samsung and Bose are not 100% compatible with their HDMI-CEC (Anynet+) with regards to properly detecting and passing the ARC audio. But with regards to basic functions such as turning on and off the console, the TV power will also turn on and off just fine.BOSE Remote control:Kudos to the Bose remote control. I like how it's made. The size is big, but it appears to be the one simple remote I can live with to replace my TV and Arris cable box remote. Of course with the button naming and placement, there is a learning curve but after an hour of playing with the Bose remote to control my cable box I believe I have it all figured out.The HDMI-CEC did not work for me. I had to program the remote for my cable box as well as the Samsung TV in order to have proper commands directly seen by each devices. Which is not a big deal once programmed. The Bose manual will explain how to program and the included program booklet codes is easy to find based on the most common devices out there.If all else fails then you'll need to program your remote the old fashioned way by learning each commands. This will take time and patience. If this were the case, I would just use multiple remote controls than program each button and then learn the use of each buttons.CONSOLE:I find the Bose console too basic in function. It's small like a basic DVR. It can take four HDMI sources with video and audio as well as well three additional audio only sources via the optical audio (Toslink), coaxial digital audio, and analog RCA audio. There is a fourth bonus analog audio input via the Adaptiq on the side. It can be programmed as an Aux audio in or even a headphone out jack. For this feature, I'm impressed Bose has thought of it to program this way than an exclusive Adaptiq jack that will theoretically be only used once.My gripe with the console is that there is no on-screen display that feeds to your TV. I was disappointed and surprised at this day and age Bose with it's price range has not built this feature. Instead I have to look at their tiny console screen to go through the menu and setup. Honestly for over a grand in purchase of even the basic CineMate 120, I can only scratch my head at this omission.And more omissions which is true to Bose, they don't really discuss or even reveal their specifications. Such that this console actually only acts like an HDMI pass through. There is no upscaling of your sources unlike my THX receiver of the same price range. Anything I feed into my home theater receiver, it looks awesome because it tries to output like it's a 4K source. The good news is Bose is able to display 4K resolution if your HDMI source is 4K as well. But the bottomline is that it will display whatever your source is the same way it's being fed into the console.But what if I have THX sources. As an audio and video enthusiast I do have THX media. Or DTS. Or Dolby Digital. So far I have seen that Bose will detect Dolby encoded media and actually display this to their mini display on the console for a few seconds or when you adjust the volume. Other than that, there is no way of knowing what Bose is receiving or actually doing to it.Which means I don't like the lack of transparency of the console. I don't know what's happening, how Bose is processing it and spewing it out. I know Bose simply wants you to forget about those things and just listen to the output. If you like what you're hearing then that's what all you should be concerned about.I have to note that Bose was criticized for this awhile back. They don't publish their specifications. Again as an audio enthusiast that cares about audio, I want to know what is the dynamic range of the Bose console and speakers? What is it really capable of? How low can the Acoustimass module go? It seems Bose wants you to forget about these technicalities. This marketing will work with people with money and no concern for anything else. If it works and seems to sound beautiful then that is all that matters. For other people like myself who are much deeper into the audio and video world, we also want more information.SOUNDBAR:Bigger is better, of course but the Bose CineMate 120 is perfect for my application. I have been wanting to buy a sound bar for my Samsung TV but everything is too long and too big. I never knew this CineMate 120 existed until it was offered to me. Actually I was not looking into Bose at all for the same reasons I said above.But 17"" in length x 3.1"" in height of a sound bar is perfect for my bedroom application. My 55"" Samsung LED TV is big enough hung on my wall, I don't need another equally big sound bar the size of my TV to show how big the picture and sound should be in my normal downtown sized bedroom. This Bose sound bar as soon as it was set up is more than loud enough to wake up the neighbors and shake their walls.I had to separately invest in the Bose WB-120 Wall-Mount Kit (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O66Q2LA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1). It costs a quarter of a Benjamin and they supply the special metal brackets. I understand why Bose does not supply it, not many people are wall mounting their TV or speakers. It's a simple bracket and did the job just fine.AUDIO QUALITY:Despite Bose criticisms from audiophiles, Bose does even say in print when I opened the package that they don't colour the sound with exaggerated highs and lows unlike other speaker systems that make you believe they sound good because of this added equalization.I raised my eyebrows then I played my audio sources. You know what, it sounds really nice. The Bose sound quality that they were known for is very evident. The mid-range is at the front and center and very clear with no audible distortion despite cranking up the volume. And at normal listening levels, dialogue was crystal clear coming from the compact sound bar. Very impressed.My previous experience with personal audio setups with studio monitor speakers and separate subwoofers now carried over to my living room, I did find shortcomings in the lower range of the audio spectrum with the sound bar and Acoustimass bass module crossover. I find that, as with all Bose crossover and their tiny speakers, the crossover is too high. Because there are no specs, it's at least at 110Hz or even higher versus the conventional 80Hz for true non-directional bass support.Because of this high crossover point, the Acoustimass module cannot really be placed anywhere despite being wireless because it tends to be directional than non-directional. So even low talking voices are split into the main sound bar and the Acoustimass module which means if they are far apart you hear the audio from two far apart sources. So to truly have a fuller effect in audio range, I would suggest to place this bass module closer to the sound bar than farther away. This will make the audio blend into one seamless dynamic range.As for the highs, there are no surprisingly annoying high notes that jump out. And that's a good thing. Bose seems to actually play the sources you feed according to how it demands to be sounded. Of course you have to bear in mind this is taking into account their proprietary processing based on their compact speaker sizes and how it affects your actual room and furniture placement.MISSES:For a system that costs over a grand, it's got to be a joke not to have wireless connectivity options already built in. Bluetooth audio has to be the standard at this point for pricey systems. In order to get wireless streaming, you will need to buy an accessory for the console. If this was a couple of hundred, it's probably understandable. But not at this price range.FINAL THOUGHTS:Just to let you guys know I did patronize Bose in their early years in the professional music DJ scene with their Bose 901 as well as their outdoor speaker application Bose 101. Then they became well known to the masses with the release of their Bose Acoustimass series speakers. By then Bose marketing was everywhere. You sit down and pretend you were listening to big speakers until the final reveal where they show you tiny speakers all around and a small bass module that drives the whole audio. My parents bought one for their home theater (and still works to this day). Then the independent testing came out. I grew up and delved further into the audio and video production where critical listening mattered. I needed to know my specs and suddenly Bose to me didn't exist.But because of this experience and for applications such as bedroom where I don't need critical listening or critical setup of speakers, but where I definitely don't want to rely on the measly flatscreen flat-sounding speakers. This Bose CineMate is a force to be reckoned with in these applications. I will choose this Bose for it's small size and powerful output over the sound bar of the other guys. At least with Bose I get an elegant looking and well constructed speaker system. It's not tacky or cheap especially when hung to the wall next to your big TV.If I were to do it all over again, I would probably still choose Bose for my bedroom and all other rooms that needed a sound bar set up with less complications than a 5.1 wiring and still output a rich sound especially for movies. The expensive price of any Bose is another factor, of course. But the seeming simplicity of their product versus the audio quality that you can get from their small speakers IS their selling point. Not to mention the build quality. You aren't getting a cheap looking product mind you. Everything is built solid.The only issue is that the missing built-in wireless connectivity at this day and age for a system costing over a grand is an unacceptable commission. Do manufacturers really have to nickel and dime the features by selling more accessories that will occupy another space on your set up as well as your power supply receptacle? It seems only Bose has thought this was a simple decision for a company that touts simplicity in their products.This will not replace your elaborate home theater speaker set up that demands critical listening and a variety of audio sources and proper certifications. This will however play along just fine with the big boys that don't care about those things as well. For a sound bar set up, Bose is definitely up there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTKB6OZ0LZBHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJTX92A#wasThisHelpful","RTKB6OZ0LZBHO","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am impressed with these small Yamaha HS5 studio monitor speakers. For my home theater set up by the living room, I went through a few speaker sets including the first version Mackie MR5 (impressive performance for the price), then the KRK RP6G2 (good design more than sound), then back to the Mackie MR5G3 (great sound, bad design). My go to speaker for the living room became the KRK because I got one of their limited edition colour scheme and with a 6.5"" woofer, produced a more robust sound. Then one day one of the KRK speakers just died. There was power, but there was no sound output. I checked it in the authorized KRK repair shop in my area and they quoted me a repair cost equivalent to the same price of a brand new speaker.Since I had a previous generation speaker, I set out to find a new pair of studio monitors. Then I came across these HS5 which is the latest version to Yamaha's infamous HS50.DESIGNUnlike KRK and Mackie of trying to one up each other in speaker design that it's getting ridiculous and tacky altogether, Yamaha has gone the traditional route of offering a boxy speaker that look like your typical bookshelf. What sets this apart is their iconic white woofer cone set against black speaker cabinet. This is further highlighted by the white illuminated Yamaha logo when powered on.In one of my old reviews I did give bad marks on the latest speaker design of the Mackie MR5G3. While it's true speakers are meant to be listened to and not looked at, as a reviewer I beg to differ. You review everything from it's design and build quality down to it's audio output quality. Plus if you buy studio monitor speakers for it's flat response to showcase in your home the way I do, then yes design does matter especially when price among other studio monitors are comparable.Like all studio monitors, this is an open design. There is no protective grill to cover the actual speakers. Except for the massive 1"" tweeter which has a metal grill.SOUND QUALITYI hesitated to jump on the Yamaha HS50 speaker because of it's reputation among audio mixers. I was looking for a decent sounding speaker that could try to achieve a flat response considering the price point. I wasn't after a $1K a pair studio monitor as I wasn't doing critical listening. I just wanted less coloration for my home theater.When the HS5 came out last year, the positive reviews started pouring in. Yamaha was able to tame the sound quality and provide a more pronounced mid-range which is perfect for overall listening.I find these speakers offer a clearer sound quality than my Mackie or KRK of similar price range. The vocal frequency range is crystal and the highs is balanced.Of course for a 5"" woofer, there practically is not much bass. It's a good thing if you want to monitor how your audio will sound in everyday speakers. For extended bass, I added a subwoofer at 80Hz cut off.OVERALLI would highly recommend these speakers if you're looking for relatively affordable studio monitors for everyday listening. For a 5"" woofer, yes these are more expensive to the comparable sized KRK RP5G3 and Mackie MR5 III but the better sound quality makes it worth the added cost.You get what you pay for. No gimmick in speaker design. Just straight up honest sound quality which I can't complain for it's price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DTL2S63A0YQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFOX420#wasThisHelpful","R2DTL2S63A0YQO","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE D-Link Wireless AC1900 (DIR-880L)UPDATE: JANUARY 17, 2015I have now moved on away from this router. It's too basic for my specific needs and although the router is powerful and will serve a majority of home users, the capability for advanced settings and control is not made available.I have an existing cable modem + router that I can set as a cable modem only and shut off the ""routing"" function. However because my home is also hard wired with ethernet sockets all around, the routing function is useful to distribute wired ethernet around the house. But the wireless function of the cable modem + router is outdated and should even have existed. Enter the need for more advanced wireless routing solutions.I needed an advanced router that will take all my 20 wired and wireless devices into a mixed environment from b/g, n, and ac connection standards. But I also need this to act as an Access Point. Yes, you can configure this router as an AP but by doing so you will lose one LAN port and the router will tell you, you are not connected to the internet simply because there is nothing connected to the WAN port.I was hoping D-Link would update their firmware to allow explicitly being an AP by using the WAN port and by still being user friendly without further advanced tinkering. Unfortunately I could not wait any longer. So I moved on and found the Netgear Nighthawk X6 R8000 that fit my needs. It allows being an Access Point by connecting your existing router into it's WAN port. It also auto detects and configures based on your existing router settings. No tinkering needed.When D-Link updates their firmware to allow being an Access Point as well, I may bring this back to life from storage so I can connect more wired devices into it.It's great for people seeking basic plug and play fast connections without any real technical needs. If this is you, it's one of the routers to consider.UPDATE: JANUARY 06, 2015Last late November 2014 there was a firmware update for the router bringing it to 1.02 and lists as follows:-----Problems Resolved:1. Sync to D-Link SVN server with GUI2. Update DHCP reservation's behaviorEnhancements:1. Update FCC band 1 output power2. Update mydlink agent-----It honestly doesn't mean much to me as I use the router as an Access Point (AP) with my internet server's cable modem as the main router. However the update does allow more stability in playing nice being used as an AP. Prior to the firmware update, this router would not allow static routing and having the same DHCP IP Address range as your main chosen router. With the update, it picks up the DHCP IP Address Range of the main router so now it can actually function as a true Access Point.I do still have one more thing to contend with this router and it's because as an Access Point I have to plug the main router ethernet to the LAN port versus the WAN port, as is the case with all routers being used as an AP.The difference is that with my old Apple Extreme router, I simply set it as a wired Bridge with static routing then it's able to detect and report having an internet connection with the main router. With the D-Link DIR-880L router as AP, it does play nice but it reports on the GUI screen and external light on the router itself that there is no internet connection and it needs to be repaired. Despite those warning, I do have internet connection. The Apple router is able to detect such, there should be no issues this 2014 router can do the same.Now at 2015 this router is not the top of the line in the consumer range. So at this point people may be buying it as an Access Point or Bridge as well and have an AC3200 act as the main router. If D-Link can listen and update their firmware to allow to have not only a Bridging option, but an Access Point option so that by doing so you can plug the main router cable to the WAN port and have 4 free LAN ports that need it. This will also allow the router to detect that there is in fact a live internet connection and will report as such.In any case I did call D-Link technical support which ""routed"" me to another country. I asked to clarify what the ""coexistence"" setting is which has been added in the new firmware, but he didn't have updated documents on his side and said it does not exist and to have me re-check what I saw. I am shaking my head with disappointment.Next I asked if he can provide ""technical support"" on how to set this up as an Access Point. He said there is no function to set it as such. Again this is incorrect because I have done it. All routers are access points and it's just a matter of setting a static IP address. If Apple can make this happen, I'm surprised D-Link cannot provide support on it with their technical support team.Lastly the version 1.0 manual talks about the Bridge mode which lets you know that if your internet provider gave a cable modem / router unit then the Bridge mode for this router will come in handy. This is only partly true. Setting it to Bridge mode will kill the WAN port and will force you to connect the D-Link router to your main router via wireless only. Unlike Apple routers, you cannot ""bridge"" via wired connection. So again I urge D-Link to update their firmware and correct the Bridge mode or add an Access Point mode so that you can truly connect this router with your existing cable modem / router unit via wired ethernet through the WAN port.When this does occur one day, I will post an update.ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS BELOW:I was surprised how slow my Apple router was until I replaced it with this D-Link Wireless AC1900 (DIR-880L) router. I didn't realize how much the router was holding up on the data transfer as I thought it was my internet provider. Swapped it for this D-Link and suddenly my computer's browser sprang to life. So if you have a dated router like I do and with limited budget, now's the time and you could be their target market.Set Up:- Super quick and easy I didn't need the actual manual to get started. You unpack the router to find the base unit and three antennas that you screw into place at the rear. You plug the ethernet cable (provided) from your internet provider's modem port to the rear port of this router that's labeled ""INTERNET"" which is also color coded yellow.- Plug the power adopter and apply power to the router.- If you are trying to connect wirelessly for the first time to the router then there is a small business card with the default router name and password. Follow that to connect either to the 2.4GHz or 5GHz bandwidth. If you are connecting via wired ethernet cable, then take any of the four gigabit ports to connect directly to your computer.- From there you simply launch your web browser and go to [...]. The set up Wizard will take over where you can finish the setup depending on the type of modem you have as well as change the broadcast name and password to your own liking.- Let the router re-start to save your settings and you sign back on with the new broadcast name and password. Once connected back in, you are now up and running.- For more advanced users, there are more settings that enable you to control the flow of data in a very easy to understand graphic interface.PROS:- Easy set up it's scary how powerful this router is, yet how intuitive it is to turn you into an advance user.- Dual core processing power that enables you to interact with this wireless router with less lag than previous router.- Fast data speeds. It's not the fastest, but it's up there in the top considering the prices of other wireless routers it's competing with.- Smartbeam technology which allows the router to concentrate on the wireless area depending on the demand of the devices in range.- Able to host and stream practically any recognizable file these days - video, audio, photo, etc.- USB port for printer and hard drives- GUI with drag and drop ability for smoothest set up.- Wall-mountable with the included hardware.CONS:- Despite being the most current model of D-Link it's still not the fastest among the other AC1900 players. However, the price of this unit makes up for the lack in speed. For regular users who are upgrading, this is plenty fast enough. For advanced users who need the most control, this may not be their cup of tea.- Odd shape. I've been used to the boxy wireless router. This one has an awkward shape with lots of edges only PC people will appreciate. I don't mind the three protruding antennas, but the footprint of this router demands more space. While the thought of hanging this doesn't really warrant being displayed, but more of hidden.- Typical plastic construction that demands to be tossed once outdated.- Very limited Bridge mode and Access Point mode. I'm glad this has a bridge mod, but it's it's too limited in feature. While it has also been pointed out to me that any router can technically act as an Access Point which after researching online is true. The problem with this router is that it is trying to analyze your input in the settings and is telling you otherwise that there is an error, etc. While trying to do Access Point manually, this router will point out that you are not connected to the internet and is suggesting to repair the settings. It will even tell you that you have no clients connected to the router. But that is not true. In my case, after manually inputting the settings to act as an Access Point all my 9 devices were able to connect wired and wirelessly to this router. They all access the internet as well as communicate with each other with the 10th device on the main router supplied by my cable provider. Despite this successful connection, I am warned I have no internet and the internet light by the front panel is not lit up. This router wants to be a smart router, but ends up being annoying.My out-dated Apple router acts as a Bridge and Access Point altogether. All I need to set is for it to be a Bridge. Then I state whether the connection is wired or wirelessly. From there is determines whether it becomes an Access Point with Bridging capability. This is what I expected from this 2014 router that boasts of it's Wizard capability.As such I am disappointed that although it has Bridge mode and everyone can manually set it as an Access Point, it cannot act as an Access Point with Bridge in the first place. If you choose Bridge, you are forced to connect wirelessly than wired which then slows you networking capability right there. Instead, you are forced to bridge from a wireless signal. If I want to improve my wireless connection I want to take the best possible source which is via the gigabit wired port. The last thing I want is to take an already degraded or reduced wireless connection and feed it into the router especially if the wireless signal is 2.4GHz rather than the latest 5GHz to begin with. This was a major disappointment for a 2014 router.OVERALL:If I was starting from scratch, I wouldn't hesitate choosing this router. It's fast and it has a powerful wireless signal. For those like me who want to expand their existing connection, it's not advantageous to choose this model.I hope D-Link is able to upgrade the firmware to allow seamless Access Point with Bridging capability via wired ethernet cable right from the Wizard setting just like my 2010 Apple router so I can truly use this as a replacement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H1S6G601MILO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8NCVX4#wasThisHelpful","R1H1S6G601MILO","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may seem like an unfair comparison, but I need to point out that it somehow reminds me of the Rabbit Air MinusA2 SPA-700/780A air purifier which this Lasko HF25630 unit will give the Rabbit Air a run for it's money. Hold on, you say as the Lasko is a third of the price of the top of the line MinusA2 SPA-780A. Let me explain later in detail.Dimension-wise the Lasko looks huge because it's tall. But it also is thin. This is versus the Rabbit Air which on the other hand looks deceivingly smaller because it's short, but it has a hefty width to house the 5 stages of filters and it's filter housing. The Lasko is thin because it has 3 stages of filters. It also comes with a non-replaceable UV-A LED to aid in killing germs which the Rabbit Air does not have. Both air filters do come with Negative Ion generators which suppose to mimic the air quality in mountains, forests and beaches.I can't complain about the plastic quality. Although I want it to be feel more solid built to the touch so it can feel classy. The lighting on the other hand is a bit not too elegant. It's a nice concept, but needs more finesse in execution. There is a light strip at the top where the flat touch-sensitive buttons are located. Within the light strip are small LEDs that light up at the bottom of the flat buttons to let you know what options have been selected. The quality of the lights look cheap although the blue colour similar to the blue hue of the Rabbit Air is soothing.Set up is easy. You remove the whole unit from the box. Remove the plastic wrapping on the unit as well as on the filters. The filters have sticker markings to let you know which side faces out. These are claimed to last a full year before replacement. Except for the carbon filter which last 4 months. So you have been provided with 3 pieces in the package. Place the filter without the packaging back and turn on the unit.Controls are easy from fan speed, timer, UV-A, Negative Ion Generator, and Sleep Mode for reduced operating noise and lighting. It also comes with a Child Lock button so they don't go playing around with the unit.Now back to the relative cheap pricing of this Lasko HF-25630 air purifier versus the 3X pricing of the Rabbit Air MinusA2 SPA-780A. The Lasko is claimed to have an effective coverage area of 200 square feet of space. The Rabbit Air claims to have an 815 square feet. So you effectively pay a third of the price, but a fourth of the capable cleaning area. What you do save up on with the Lasko is the air filter cost that comes out around 23% cheaper. But then realizing there are only three physical filter stages on the Lasko versus five physical filter stages on the Rabbit Air, it comes out to be more expensive considering there are less elements in the purchase and that the filter kit is designed to filter a fourth of the coverage area.The Lasko has another weakness such that the metal stand is not adjustable or removable. That means it also has no capability to be hung on the wall.Still the Lasko is relatively cheap and does perform well. Not everyone is willing to shell out 3x more or has the need to filter a 815 sq ft of space for their intended need. At which case, this Lasko is your next best bet to do the job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R40EPS88GJUUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JLANFKC#wasThisHelpful","R40EPS88GJUUR","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't realize how basic this router was in today's day and age. For one Benjamin, I didn't expect much but I didn't expect too little.This router is for beginners and that's what the selling point is. It's for people who just want to get on wirelessly without any hassle for complicated settings or features. That's a good thing if you just want to connect via a tablet or smartphone. However if you need multiple wired and wireless combination, then it's best to look elsewhere.Pros:1. Simple setup2. Smartphone app setup and controls3. Multi-voltage power adapter4. Wireless and wired connections5. USB 2.0 printer /  external hard drive capabilityCons1. No Gigabit LAN. Only 10/100 connection2. No Bridge / Repeater Mode to extend a wireless connection3.

Needs to be better for today's standards.I was hoping to use this as a wireless connection and turn off the wireless feature in the cable/modem supplied device.of my home internet provider. It cannot act as wireless bridge.Wireless signal despite the two ugly antennas was not any stronger than my current wireless cable modem.Perhaps as a senior this would be most appealing .

"I like this product. I have always trusted 3M for its innovation. I have used a few of their automotive chemicals in the last but not in this form of a complete kit.The product came in a box within a box. The outer box is from Amazon's shipping department which basically places the 3M packed box inside. As for the 3M box, the bottles are packed right inside via a brown crumpled paper to fill in the gap. This however doesn't stop the contents from moving and shifting around when in transit so I understand how spills can occur. My 3M box had a slight spill from one of the bottles because basically each bottle doesn't have an inner seal. And for bottles with chemicals, this concerns me. So if a cap comes loose during transit, the liquid leaks out slowly as what happened to one of my bottles or severely as what happened to the others who reviewed the product.Even at half price it may be expensive but the performance each product gives is satisfying. Don't get me wrong, there is no magic in here. Just effective chemicals and elbow grease to make your detailing time worthwhile.The 3M Car Wash Soap is as I have expected with other car soaps very sweet smelling like cherry. Perhaps it's psychological but it does make washing the vehicle more enjoyable. This preps the vehicle.From there you grab the Lens and Hard Plastic Cleaner to remove any surface contaminants from the aging process.Then into the Wheel and Tire Cleaner that effectively removes grease and grime.If you haven't waxed the paint in awhile then you need to go with the Synthetic Wax Protectant. The chemical binds to your paint to form a protectant while giving a great shine in the process.The Quick Wax Detailer is an in-between wax for the maintenance of your vehicle protection and shine. Do this until you are ready for your next major wax job.Now that your exterior has been taken care of. Time for the Leather and Vinyl Restorer. This is one of the better products I've used. Like I said it's not magic but it does work effectively. The best part like my other favourite interior cleaner is that it doesn't leave an oily residue.Part of the 12-piece pack is actually just 5 pieces of similar micro fiber clothes which if you already care for your car you may have purchased these in bulk quantities like myself. So this isn't really a selling point and doesn't impress me to create a ""12 Piece Kit"".I wish they went further and equipped the kit with brushes for the wheel and interior. That would help anyone who wants to build a kit or to simply replace their existing ones.Overall highly recommended kit especially if you want to replace your micro fiber cloths.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFUZW20260V3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KI8EE6#wasThisHelpful","RRFUZW20260V3","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow this was better than I expected for the price it's being sold. I was ready to receive a flimsy device but it's actually a bit more substantial to hold.The body is made of solid plastic and has metal and rubber accents. The former is to add more class. The latter is for better grip. All three components are well put together.It is a simple hand pump. You pump to suck the air out of the bottle with the aid of the supplied stopper. Once it gets harder to pump then most of the air is expelled slowing down the oxidation process.Two stoppers are provided logically for red and white wine. The seal is tight so to release the stopper you simply press down on the grey tab and voila almost fresh wine ready for another round.I wouldn't hesitate recommending this product.

"I like this glass lid. Amazon states it's made in Germany, but the box states it's made in Italy.

The glass is thick and unlike other glass lids it has no metal ring around where food particles can collect over time.There are no sharp folds so clean up is easier and smoother when using a sponge.The top handle is plastic, but substantial to hold.It's an expensive purchase for what it is, but worth the price it's being sold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J8OVBCVP8OS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057U0AQW#wasThisHelpful","R3J8OVBCVP8OS8","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a good looking stainless steel polished to a mirror shine 8"" pan suitable to cook for 1 person. For the small size of the pan, it's quite expensive. Despite Amazon's claim it's made in Germany, the packaging clearly states it's made in China. I've emailed Amazon about it. Because of this and because of the price, I'm still debating whether it's worth keeping it.I was expecting better packaging and presentation but its just cardboard paper wrapping around the pan.I also got the optional glass lid. At least that one comes in a box and made in Italy. Again Amazon states the lid is made in Germany.I got this for the organic ceramic non-stick coating that's PTFE and PFOA free. Touted by WMF to be long-lasting and can withstand heat up to 400C / 750F.Highly recommended if only it was still made in Germany.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LU3U7O4TZAHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052CGH1W#wasThisHelpful","R2LU3U7O4TZAHJ","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great in theory. I was replacing my two year old Simple Human in-sink caddy that wax all rubber and stainless steel. I just neglected to clean it regularly and formed too many water residue that made it hard to clean at the end.I thought this was a nice change since I can free up my sink space.THOUGHTS:- Nice design.- Too much plastic making it too lightweight and less elegant in feel.- Footprint is larger but has less practical and useable space than my Simple Human in sink caddy.- Pricing for this plastic is more expensive that the stainless steel caddy. What!- The rectangular bin is useless for bigger bottles. You'll need a small bottle to have something fit in there. While the bin wall is too tall my small bottle barely peeps out for me to grab properly. They should have just included a custom bottle that's tall and refillable.- Then there is the small space for a tiny sponge that mr regular 3M sponge is too big. I'd rather they make it sit up vertically to save space and have a smaller footprint.OVERALL:Joseph Joseph has some few interesting designs for the kitchen that I own. I took a chance on this one. Now I'm wondering what they were thinking to even get this passed the concept stage. It's a bad design that tosses around too easily. And for the same price as the stainless steel Simple Human caddy, they practically are getting away with murder.I'm waiting for Simple Human to make a similar caddy for the kitchen countertop. And when that happens I'm ditching this junk.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H830CBNQTBGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006BSCOTK#wasThisHelpful","R2H830CBNQTBGT","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a loyal Sonicare user since their original E-series with the big bulky brush heads and magnetic pulsation. Prior to that I was an Oral-B user with their round toothbrush heads but was never happy with the performance.Now on my third Sonicare model I opted for the DiamondClean edition in Black.I can't believe how expensive this model is. The contents are definitely an upgrade with a glass charger and elegant travel case that doubles as a USB charger.Contents:1. 1pc. Black DiamondClean toothbrush.2. 2pcs Black DiamondClean brush heads3. Glass that doubles as a caddy and charger for the toothbrush4. Travel case that holds the toothbrush and two brush heads and also doubles as a charger5. USB cable6. Home charger base7. Travel chargerThe black looks sleek and very cool. The backlit white  lettering and green charging icon are all hidden from view until lit up.USE:Charge for 24 hours upon first use.Press button quickly to select brushing mode.You can press button another time to turn off.PROS:- Lightweight handle versus previous models- Sleek, elegant design from the handle to the charging glass to the charging base- Slippery handle becomes almost rubbery when wet- Quiet operation due to the addition of a rubber ring to dampen the vibrating stalk of the toothbrushCONS:- Expensive- Smooth handle is too slippery- Charging glass as a storage caddy is almost too useless. It's fine for one brush with a brush head to place while charging. However if you add a second brush head to the mix for your partner then you don't have a toothbrush storage place for it. The extra brush head ends up laying around your countertop. Not to mention they eliminated the color coded rings.- Brush heads have no more color coded rings for another person.- Single button for everything just like the low model HealthyWhite series. Why? So much price for too simplistic operation. I want an on/off button as well as a button to change the brushing modes.- No more UV cleaner that doubles as the storage. I don't mind the UV elimination but at least a caddy for two or more brush heads since they can't all go into the glass.- Sticking plastic button when not pressed straight down. I found my toothbrush changes modes by itself because the button can get stuck if not pressed straight down. It needs a better button mechanism.OVERALL:I purchased this ""upgrade"" if only for the cool black model. Otherwise the previous Premium Edition with two handles, two buttons, a UV sanitizer that doubles as a toothbrush holder is the best value for your hard earned money.If I knew what I was getting into I would think twice until an upgrade comes along that addresses the above concerns.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A012CF6GYVPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FS2N3FE#wasThisHelpful","R2A012CF6GYVPJ","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to love this Flat Bumper. I've come to respect Power Support USA since I first saw them on the MacWorld trade show back in 2002-2003 over at San Francisco with their simple, classy product design and solutions towards enhancing Apple products.Here I am still an Apple user and still wanting a simple and elegant solution towards protecting my iPhone without disrupting it's overall design. This Flat Bumper is very much identical to Apple's very own Bumper Case for the iPhone 4, but goes one step further in being very minimalistic such that it's the most inconspicuous bumper people can mistake it for the actual rim of the iPhone.It's a Flat Bumper because there are no protruding buttons. Everything sits flush like one whole plastic with no markings at all. The plastic bumper does have groove marks which basically allows that part of the plastic to bend and therefore enabling you to depress on it and the actual iPhone buttons underneath it.There is great attention to detail on the design that even the tiny speaker and mic hole cut-outs are replicated on the flat bumper case. In fact the only major give-away that it is a bumper case is through the cut-outs on the silent button, which isn't a problem to reach.So with this much glowing review, why only 3 stars?For one the fit towards the power button is not as good such that depressing on that part of the plastic may need some adjustment if you wish a better tactile feedback that you are in fact depressing the power button. Even Power Support has admitted this issue by already supplying you with a set of clear stickers that you can basically overlay on top of each other underneath the flat bumper to add thickness to that area. This will help you tailor the depressing action. Too much stickers and the power button may end up constantly being pressed on it's own. I left it alone with no stickers and got used to pressing the button even harder.This issue is not a problem at all on the volume buttons which provide excellent tactile feedback. I wish they were able to tailor the power button without the supplied stickers which I find tacky.Second and more importantly, I've come to realize the external colour - whether gold, silver or black, is painted. Underneath is a black TPU (plastic). This is very disappointing because unlike Apple's original bumper case that is molded in it's own coloured TPU, Power Support has chosen the very cheap route of molding everything is basic black plastic and just painting everything according to the external colour.The result of which since the flat bumper if your first line of defense, it takes the scuffs and grunts. And even if it hasn't fallen to the ground I find the paint easily gets chipped away. After a month of use I see small black spots here and there looking like pimples for the phone.I purchased a touch up automotive paint to re-paint it back. It's not perfect, but it's way better than the ugly black spots underneath.Recommendation:Skip. Fast forward a few months later and I find Zagg has come up with an exact replica of this flat bumper with the exception that the whole TPU is the actual external colour. So if you have some chips and marks, it's still the same colour underneath. It doesn't look cheap and ugly unlike this flat bumper in the long run. Oh and the Zagg is much cheaper and comes with a Limited Lifetime Warranty same as their Invisishield.Shame on Power Support.

"I wish there were three kinds of cut for the Fred Perry polo collared t-shirts similar to their long and short sleeves polo sport shirts. For the polo shirts they have this one which is the regular fit which is the British cut which is a modern straight cut. It's not loose on the body and therefore is not sloppy in appearance. Then they have the slim fit polo shirt version which is ultra super fitted it's busting at the seams for my stocky build. I love the fact that the slim fit has a higher cut at the armholes and shorter sleeves, but my gosh I can barely breathe with the tight fit at the chest. They should have a TRIM FIT version which is in between the regular fit and SLIM FIT. Which means it can be a tad tighter tighter at the chest and have a higher cut at the armholes with shorter sleeves. As I mentioned the Fred Perry polo sport shirts have these three kinds of fit, but surprisingly not on these everyday polo shirts.With that said, I love the quality of these twin tipped polo shirts despite being made in China. The cloth is hefty in weight and the sewing is solid down to the twin tipped accent.The only issue with online shopping is that the colors most often don't translate well to the home user due to the varying degree of monitor brands which are not professionally calibrated. And even if you do professionally calibrate your monitor, I find the hue varies between online stores. One website has theirs a bit darker than the other for the exact polo shirt. I recommend comparing the same shirt on the official Fred Perry website to get a better idea of how dark, light or bright it might look in person.Other than that you will just have to purchase and return it if the color isn't what you expect.I find that the colors on Amazon are bang on in hue, except that whoever processed the photo made the photos too bright. For example the Black/Ochre/Coral Pink combination feels like the black has faded in the photo while the ochre (yellow) and coral (pink) twin tipped accents are lively. In person everything about the shirt is a tad darker. The black is indeed black and the yellow is like mustard. So if you account for that fact, you will get a better feel of the colors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VHUZVNBA7LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TV4972#wasThisHelpful","R36VHUZVNBA7LE","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have both colors of these Fred Perry Men's Gingham Trim End on End Shirt in Slate (Grey) and Pink.I actually LOVE the fit of this short sleeve polo. I especially love the styling of these ""Trim End on End"" which is a gingham trim and gives it a notch above the usual plain polos or even the already obvious twin tipped on the collar. It definitely provides an air of class.The reason I gave it only four stars is because I can't for the life of me figure out how Fred Perry determines the fit of it's shirts. And this is NOT a SLIM FIT.They have the regular fit which is a modern straight cut and not loose. Then they have in-between TRIM FIT which is taking the regular fit, but tailoring it closer to the chest and armholes. The third is the SLIM FIT which is the super tight fit for male models with a body I can only envy. The best way I can describe the SLIM FIT is like wearing a size medium TRIM FIT on a body meant for a size large TRIM FIT.I have all the kinds of cuts for Fred Perry for all the kinds of shirt styles and none of them fit the same way. You just have to try it on to know the actual fit on your body. For example my regular fit long sleeve polo in large is too loose almost like a pajama. But my regular fit twin tipped polo shirt in large is a great fit for it's modern straight cut. While my SLIM FIT twin tipped polo shirt also in large is too tight it's busting at the seams. Then my SLIM FIT short sleeve polo sport including these ones is the best cut and considered the TRIM FIT. It's fitted alright, but not too tight. Very decent and very British. The problem is that it's not labeled a TRIM fit. It's simply labeled also as a SLIM fit which I always buy with caution. And since some SLIM FIT are actually a TRIM FIT, I will never know what kind of fit it will actually be without trying it on.Unless there is enough previous user feedback on the fit of each shirt. Each person will just really have to buy and try. Rest assured though that if you find the right fit for your body for that particular style, then obviously a different color choice will have the same fit like these two slate and pink version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5HIQYPEYAJBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISUJH76#wasThisHelpful","R5HIQYPEYAJBG","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update 6/22:It's worth noting that other reviewers have received a PRO-642 camera with this kit which is the widescreen version of the PRO-535 camera. Both have a 960H resolution which is DVD quality. The Amazon description states you are receiving 650TVL resolution which is the PRO-535. So if you do receive a PRO-642 then you are very lucky.----------I was just getting started in setting up the Swann, until I reached into the second set of camera box kit and realized they missed packing me a power supply for the camera. Major oops on Swann.In any case, I powered the main unit to get a decent review and see what else could be missing.Everything is straightforward. You connect the unit to a video monitor which in my case is a HDTV via the included HDMI cable that surprisingly has gold connectors. And then connect the supplied optical mouse at the back. From there you can optionally connect the supplied ethernet cable, but this is really for internet function which you may or may not want to use depending on your application. The unit powers up and you are instantly greeted with a simple set up screen that let's you plug in the date, time, format settings. You actually don't need to read the manual as the OSD (on-screen display) is self explanatory majority of the time. The only setback is there are times I want to click on an icon to reveal more information, but it just exits that particular screen altogether. So at times when I thought I had more control over it, the operation reveals to be too limited.It would be best to know your ideal screen resolution for the monitor and camera you are using. This one defaults to a standard definition output and puts black bars to the left and right of my HDTV monitor. So I had to switch to 1,920 x1,800 to get proper resolution which the Swann unit was able to achieve. However, despite the recorder being widescreen capable, the included cameras are not widescreen (just high resolution). So it appears the picture is unnaturally stretched out when in widescreen mode. I will have to play with the resolution setting a little bit more to see if there is a widescreen option without stretching out the picture.Don't expect the GUI (graphic user interface) to be Mac or Windows quality. To have a person be able to jump on (say a security guard or a family member), then custom icons would be useless but text and universal button descriptions is the key to intuitive operation. At this point, yes you can probably figure out the controls faster than going through the manual. But there are a lot of trial and error text/button for me to figure out what each would do or what buttons to press to get to where I want to go. Most of this struggle is in wanting to view recorded video as well as trim, copy and paste it for saving the important ones.I know the unit will overwrite once it gets full, but I couldn't figure out how to delete a specific video which I realize I can't probably for security reasons and to ensure timeline of each recording is accountable. However the only way to erase any video is to initialize the hard drive altogether which is more dangerous because you lose the whole recording. I feel as an admin, you should be able to do in saving/deleting some than an all or nothing approach.For an 8-camera setup, you have a good choice of options on how to view on your monitor. From a single camera view, a 4-camera view all the same size, an 8-camera view with one large video and seven small videos on the perimeter, and finally a 9-camera view with all eight cameras at the same size and a Swann logo to occupy the ninth position.Camera quality of the PRO-535 is as I've come to expect at this price point. It is not a widescreen camera as I pointed above. The recording unit is widescreen capable. So there is a bit of a mismatch in the kit. It's not the greatest, but it's pretty good and clear. Even on low light indoors the video is obviously DVD quality. It is worth noting that the colors are enhanced with over saturation at times. On a cloudy day, my video surveillance looks bright and cheerful.The night video is even more impressive. You can hear an internal click when the camera determines it needs to go into night mode. At this point it switches into Black and White. With the 960H quality, you can see a great amount of detail.NETWORKING:I have not tested out the networking feature, but have to mention that the unit is capable of operating headless. Which means you won't need a video monitor once it's up and running. You can just connect it to your router and operate remotely as well as view footage.It is equipped with their ""SwannLink"" which you download their app for your smartphone, and then view through your mobile device. Once I have properly set this up with all 8 cameras, I will test and update my review further.CUSTOMER SUPPORT:EXTREMELY POOR! I don't mind that they are from another country. It's globalization these days, but to represent Swann in a terse and stoic way without any actual help at the end of the 50 minute call is a complete waste of time. I requested the missing power adapter. She noted everything and was typing away. Repeated all my information and then said to email their customer support regarding my request. At the end of the call I thought she was going to say ""okay we will ship you the power adapter"" because God forbid what else can I do with a power adapter? Rule the world? Nope. She said she took note of it all and that I should email their customer support in the USA when they open on Monday with my information and request all over again. What a complete disappointment for this company. I would have wholeheartedly recommended their product. Sure they claim lifetime support 24x7, but if I have to deal with these same people one more time should another issue occur I would just dump this product for a better one that has better after-sales support which could make or break a company in the long run.OVERALL:Everything you need to get started, set up and installed is included including what I already mentioned above - HDMI cable, Optical Mouse, Mounting Screws, BNC + Power Supply cables, Manual/Documentation, and Theft-Deterrent Stickers should you wish to announce to people you do have a video surveillance on-site right off the bat.So why only 3 stars? Like I mentioned, for a company that specializes in ""security"" I'm disappointed they missed packing the power adapter in one of the box set for the camera. For me that's a major blunder.Second, they provided only one power adapter and a four-way splitter to power the four cameras. If your camera placement are all far apart wouldn't it be more convenient to power them individually than have all these wiring run through the house because you only have one power supply.Third, functions within the unit can be more responsive and more intuitive. For people who don't have time to read the manual, or a security personnel who is jumping in for someone else's shift there should be a quick text that appears over an icon to further describe what action is being performed by clicking it.Fourth, poor customer support. Lack of enthusiasm and unhelpful support. I spend 50 minutes on the phone from waiting in line (25 mins) to the end of our conversation where she took down all my information, address, telephone number, etc.Other than the above, I'm pretty happy with the performance and video quality of this specific package. I would not hesitate to recommend for people needing an 8-camera setup and still on a budget.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F6ZBDHXX7A58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPPZNYY#wasThisHelpful","R2F6ZBDHXX7A58","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE JULY 03, 2014:Okay so after a month, I am updating my review. My M/L sized hands has gotten used to the thin stalk of the razor versus the beefy handle of the Fusion Proglide Styler.I do find it minutely more responsive, but unlike the commercial for this new razor it's impossible that you don't stretch your skin while shaving. So I still do to allow the closest shave possible. And apart from all these, I still shave everyday.The pricing is the same as the previous model so again, it's a no-brainer upgrade if you're in the market for a new handle.I am still maintaining my 3 star review because of the reasons in my original review. The weakest link of all this is the razor blade that dulls quickly. Yes, you can do so many tricks and maintenance to make it last longer but what's the point of a disposable blade if you have to do all that work to save so little. So within 3 weeks, I toss it out or shaving doesn't become comfortable.I get it they need to make money to have you replace the blade while charging an arm and a leg for it. I've accepted that fact, but can it at least be sharp until the last use. I promise I'll toss it out every month if I have to.I think the next step is to improve the blade sharpness. Make it blow up after a month if it's still in use. That way, we still continue to buy new blades to have Gillette make money. Just saying.-----ORIGINAL REVIEWI thought I was the market for this next step in Gillette Fusion's Proglide series with the introduction of the Flexball, but it seems I am not convinced with this one.I have been a Gillette razor patron for the longest time since the Gillette Sensor progression onto the Mach3 series and finally the current Fusion series.This latest ""Flexball technology"" no matter how complicated it may seem is just has an addition of a pivot point that allows the whole blade cartridge to rotate left and right (yaw rotation) to a limited degree, of course. The bottom-line of this is to allow maximum contact on skin for a closer shave with less irritation.Just a note that:1. The Silvertouch is just the chrome and silver finish of the razor blade to differentiate it with the current Fusion Proglide razor to signify the additional of the Flexball technology.2. While the Fusion Proglide cartridge/blades itself is still the same carry-over from the Proglide series. Nothing has changed in this aspect so if you still have a stack of cartridges from the Fusion or Fusion Proglide series, you can still use it with this latest razor.USAGE:With this power version, the power button glows bright orange to indicate it is on. Although it is a nice tough I still find it unnecessary because the fact that one is holding the razor and it is vibrating already tells you it is on. You will not have it vibrate on your hand and then check the light to verify it is on, right? Unless one has a really low IQ. I can only hope this does not eat into the battery life.I was disappointed to have experienced hair pulling and a minor razor cut on my first attempt. It seems the razor did not glide smooth enough on my skin than I had hoped. I don't know if it's because of the pivoting cartridge that I have to re-train my hands how to handle this shaver. Still if they want more customers to adapt to this Silvertouch then it should complement their current shaving style with the Fusion Proglide and not re-educate because of the Flexball.It's worth noting that I am presently using Gillette's Fusion Proglide Styler and love it. I love the beefy handle and it's versatility while still using the Fusion Proglide cartridge. With the Silvertouch Flexball, the handles are extremely curvy to allow imaginative razor handling.What I do love about Gillette's razors is that they are able to make it look and feel more expensive that the plastic piece it really is. Kudos to the Gillette team. This comes at a price such that you do have to purchase the razor despite knowing the blade cartridges are even more expensive to purchase similar to the printer and ink business.If you have been a Gillette razor user, this is simply a natural progression with your next upgrade. If you are in no rush, then you don't need to run out and buy on it's first release. Since it still uses the Fusion Proglide cartridge, the only benefit really is the addition of the  side to side flexing motion that I did not find convincing for me to upgrade right now. I usually wait for a sale on the razor handle before I upgrade and this is something I can wait out now knowing how this performs.Lastly with the price of this Silvertouch, I am surprised they haven't equipped this with a full case with stand. More like a half-hearted plastic to protect the blade. With this release they should have designed a cool silver stand as well.Unless you are a first-time Gillette Fusion Proglide user, there is nothing revolutionary that will really make you want to throw your current handle for this one. Three stars overall for this version. I am hoping they can improve the accessories in the long run. As for me, it's back to the Fusion Proglide styler.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK8AZQ0OFHOU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2APS60#wasThisHelpful","RK8AZQ0OFHOU2","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SD cards have gone a long way since it was introduced 15 years ago in 1999. I remember paying an arm and a leg for SanDisk's Ducati edition SDHC for over 5X the price it is today at half the capacity.Who would have known Samsung would enter the memory card market and introduce something that looks so elegant and packed with features.This Samsung SDHC UHS-I PRO line card has a theoretical read speed up to 90MB/s and theoretical write speed up to 50MB/s.The ""PRO"" line guarantees the card to be:- Water Proof- Shock Proof- Magnet Proof- Extreme temperature Proof- X-Ray ProofAnd then backs it up with a 10-year Limited Warranty.Amidst a sea of basic black and blue SD cards slapped with tacky multicolor labels, Samsung has introduced an elegant white SD card with a grey and silver label. They may be late to the game, but they do know how to raise the stakes and make it classy.Who is this card for? If you're a professional or prosumer then it is a no-brainer to invest in the fastest card compatible with your device and protect your data from your environment conditions.Honestly with the prices of memory cards these days, I recommend this card for everyone. Who doesn't take tons of photos and videos and wouldn't want to protect it? In fact pros are more careful with the handling of their data, but consumers tend to take, erase and toss stuff around more without thinking of the consequences.This is an SDHC (high capacity) Class 10 device that is also rated for UHS-I (ultra high speed) capable of sustained writing large full HD 1080P data files.So I say regardless of your professional or consumer status, invest in the best cards and carry it over to your next device.Shortcoming: An elegant plastic protective case should have been included for the price. But not enough to warrant a loss of star.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CQFOL7GG2YF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVPU6AA#wasThisHelpful","R2CQFOL7GG2YF6","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since our first child, we have been advocates of swaddling for the first few months to keep the baby calm as she transitions from being constricted in the womb to having her arms flailing freely.Now on our second baby, we feel swaddling helps make her sleep soundly. No reflex waking her up in the middle of the night.Although there are two available sizes - Small/Medium for babies 6-12lbs (0-3 months) and Medium/Large for babies 12-18lbs (3-6 months) - swaddling is useful only until the moment your baby can roll over.Swaddling is purported to regulate the baby's internal temperature. However please be mindful of the room temperature to avoid overheating.PROS:- Very soft terry cotton.- Just the right amount of cloth thinness on the top portion, and a thicker padding at the bottom part- Classy muted colors- Pocket for arms in between the swaddle cloth- Velcro closure for easy closure, removal, and adjustment.CONS:- Packaging does not state there are two swaddle blankets included - Pink and Natural or Blue and Natural- Bottom part for the legs is not detachable which could be useful for layeringOVERALL:People may find this a bit pricy for it's limited use as a swaddle blanket. Yes, I also use a muslin blanket as a swaddle but this is more convenient to use and more structured by keeping hands completely tucked in and feet enclosed. When I use a blanket as a swaddle, the legs are eventually exposed and arms are able to move about until the blanket is loosened completely in a few short hours.Don't fret as there is life after it's intended use. Just like my previous swaddled, as soon as my baby is able to roll over I use it simply as a blanket. All you need to do is wrap your baby from the chest which means the arms are exposed to go about freely. That way the body and legs are still wrapped like a blanket but more secure with no loose clothing article all over the baby.Less one star because the packaging is not clear and the bottom part for the legs is not detachable. Otherwise, a good swaddler I can trust.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U1GH2UI1TVH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWG6QKC#wasThisHelpful","R1U1GH2UI1TVH0","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I owned this since it was on pre-order. Customer service is pretty helpful at first in sorting out any defects or complaints.PROS:- Nice design.- Unique clasp similar to watches.- Clasp is made of metal.CONS:- Actual bumper border feels like cheap plastic. Only the metal clasp is the winning design. They could have beefed up the bumper material with better plastics.- Power Button is very flimsy and has a design flaw. It is held in place by a thin piece of plastic that needs to be flexible to achieve the up and down pressing of the button. This will eventually snap from use due to stress in the material. At this point there is no other recourse in replacing the button. You have to buy a new case as the thin plastic has now broken into two. Trying to glue the plastic will work, but it needs flexibility so it will only go so far.

"Let's set this straight, this isn't your Epson PowerLite or PowerLite Pro projector for your home cinema use. This projector is built for business applications where static presentations are used and the occasional videos are shown. Let me say that again, occasional videos are shown.At 5.1lbs, this is a projector that is built for portability. Surprisingly, the lack of a storage bag is a disappointment and turn-off for purchasers in this segment. Portability can be intra-office from one meeting room to the next, but do you want to be one of those geeks awkwardly carrying the projector around than having a bag that houses the projector, power cord, cables, remote?While I'm being a Debbie Downer, don't go imagining you can use this as a boom box to impress your clients with that awesome cash register sound effects you inserted in your presentation. Because the built-in 1-watt (mono) speaker will make you wish you brought some portable speakers to the meeting room together with the bag. Oh, wait. There is no bag. So try walking along the hallway bringing that projector with cables and speaker resting on top with the remote in your pocket. Is that a remote in your pocket? Why yes! But you meant to say no. Too late.What it does have is a budget-friendly price tag for an office that does presentations on a seldom basis (i.e. quarterly), classrooms, or a salesman who didn't do his research or is simply on a tight spend allowance.On a positive note, projection is a mere 6 feet for a 50"" screen. You have the flexibility of an HDMI, USB (including portable hard drives, cameras, flash drives, etc.), and VGA port.Set up is the usual which I would rather take the time to do it right the first time.PROS:- 3LCD, 3-chip technology- Connections via HDMI, USB, and VGA.- Light and compact.- Better than average among it's price range at 2,700 lumens for both color and white light output. As I said earlier, this projector shines in static presentations where acceptable ambient light is still present . It does well in video applications, but you are losing resolution in displaying wide screen images and you would want total darkness to boost picture quality.CONS:- Very weak 1-watt speaker for a portable projector that needs built-in sound than a professional home theater projector that demands external sound output- No bag included which is a surprise for a compact, portable projector- Could use an HDMI cable to complete the package- A backlit remote would be nice and thoughtful for a projector of this business applicationOVERALLI'm not going to complain the lack of features like a widescreen 16:9 ratio, 3-D capability, Wi-Fi, or Ethernet access. Because this projector is indeed priced right for the value features within the budget constraints of this valu range. For the above features, you need on spend more.I am surprised though of the lack of a storage bag that should be included and an HDMI cable that is standard in video output.While the weak audio output can be a turn-off for people looking for an all-in-one application especially when on the road.For this I have rated at this price range 4 out of 5 stars. If Epson can improve on these two aspects as well as a backlit remote and still retain the price range, it would definitely be a perfect 5 star projector of this intended value series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO7NP91I00APY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMGDH38#wasThisHelpful","RO7NP91I00APY","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am reviewing the Fugoo Sport model.First impressions:- Great packaging. Definitely adds some class to the product (and cost).- This is the second portable Bluetooth speaker I have owned. I have to admit I was a bit skeptic with the quality of this relative newcomer of this category coming to play along with the big boys.- The overall dimension feels like I'm holding a 6"" sub sandwich in my hand. Although it's actually 7.4"" in length.- Solid feel and construction.PROS:- Impressive overall sound. You have to take note, these are not studio monitor speakers that aim to replicate sound according to how it was recorded. These and all other Bluetooth speakers in it's category aim to produce ear candy quality audio which means there is a lot of processing going on behind the scene to help compressed audio files produce bass boosting lows and ear popping highs. For outdoor party and beach applications, that's fine by me. With this it is able to claim a frequency response of 60Hz - 20KHz.- Innovative interchangeable jacket to help you not only find your style that suits your environment. Easily removable with a latch and a simple slide out. No complex multiple locks to bother with.- Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless speaker that lasts up to 40 hours on medium volume. This is the manufacturer claim which I haven't tested because I just plug to recharge the unit after every use.- The Sport jacket is the middle of the pack in durability that still is waterproof, snow proof, dust proof, and shock proof.- Also has a 3.5mm audio input should you wish to connect a wired audio source which I welcome because I don't want to waste the batteries (of the audio source and this Fugoo) by transmitting wirelessly.- Six audio drivers (4 active with 2 tweeters and 2 woofers + 2 passive drivers to basically absorb and take up the sound energy from the active drivers) = omni-directional sound so everyone gets the sweet spot.- Button controls and a built-in microphone for your smart phone so you don't have to go fumbling for your phone at all and keep it tucked in your pocket.- Underside mounting which the company sells add-ons for a bike mount, strap mount, and a multi-mount where you can hook up a carabiner in one end.CONS:- I'm still not in love with the SPORT design and teal color choice compounded by the multiple wavy lines along the product. I prefer a clean look but still retain the rubbery grip of the jacket. I hope the company can come up with additional jacket designs.- The price seems a bit steep at first look which strongly needs a live demo for people to be convinced in choosing this over the others. Yes, the replaceable jacket and all-weather capability is a strong selling point in itself. But at the end of the day, you can only buy one Bluetooth speaker so sound quality and sound output matters. The Fugoo demands to be heard.OVERALL:Once you get passed the sticker shock and considering what's in the box as well as the capability of the speaker, you have to appreciate you are paying a premium for this Fugoo Bluetooth speaker. The speaker comes with (apart from the actual speaker core + chosen jacket style) an AC adapter, USB cable, 3.5mm audio cable, and accessories bag. In other words, it comes with the whole shebang to get you started and on the move from the house to the beach.Clean up is easy by removing the speaker core and washing the external jacket in running water and mild soap. Just be wary of not using high pressure water in order not to damage the speaker fabric. Although the TOUGH replacement jacket can take the abuse.I like the design of the speaker core itself and I would rather display it ""nude"" just like my studio speakers. Of course this is not advisable as curious hands can damage the speaker.I'm not in love with any of the jacket designs from STYLE, SPORT, or TOUGH (which looks like it took a cue from the outdated Panasonic Toughbook laptops). I like a simple, rugged jacket with not much wavy lines. How about an aluminum shell for STYLE and an all-black rubber jacket for SPORT.In any case, I do recommend this product for it's innovative features and sound output that is fit for an outdoor lifestyle. Minus 1 star for the design, but 5 stars for everything else.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9HOKYP14PJRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBJ3MT8#wasThisHelpful","R9HOKYP14PJRI","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the design of Salomon shoes and their quick lacing system. It's the easiest and smoothest one pull lacing I've ever experienced that it became my go-to shoes.They make true to size and fits exactly as I expect for my size.There are colors for everyone's taste from loud, eye-catching bright tones to dark, muted tones which is more my style. I like mine to be on the down low, but with killer Ninja moves when the occasion calls for it. Rather than the ""hey look at me and my bright awesome shoes"" and then when the race starts you trip. In any case, I'm just glad Salomon still makes different colors and hasn't gone all out crazy just making bright neon colors on this shoe, yet.These are my all-season shoes I can count on. I use these from walking on trails with gravel and loosely packed snow. To the parks and malls. Where I live it rains frequently so I don't have fear of getting my feet soaking wet from the rain and the puddles. However don't go Rambo on it as despite having Goretex waterproofing material, the toes do get a bit wet eventually. When I complained at the Salomon stand-alone store, I was told it's normal.The soles are very durable running in them at the gym and have better than average traction. My biggest complain are the cracks that easily form by the force of the outer toe mound. Of course this will depend on how aggressive you use the shoe, but for a trail running shoe then it supposed to be reinforced for this purpose. I even walked into a North Face store and the person said it's a shame it's a nice shoe with the same weakness we all know about. (I did buy a North Face trail running shoe also that day when I saw they had the quick lace system similar to the Salomon, but the fit and lacing is terrible).PROS:1. Design and colors from loud to muted.2. Best quick lacing I've seen.3. Goretex textile for waterproof4. Durable soles5. Great fitCONS:1. For a trail running shoe that should last, the shoe cracks fast by the outer toe mound.2. Despite the Goretex material, it does get wet by the toes when exposed to water longer.3. Goretex lining will make your feet warmer versus non-Goretex lined shoes, obviously.OVERALL:I will not hesitate to recommend these specific shoes for your all season casual go-to shoes. If people use it for the trails, it will definitely survive and last longer at the malls.If only Salomon can listen to the regular users and reinforce the shoe once and for all to prevent the usual cracking on the outer toe mound it would be a perfect 5 star shoe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHPS9M2V4VCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LB4P14#wasThisHelpful","RJHPS9M2V4VCM","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know if Manfrotto has a direct hand at manufacturing this bag, but the quality is excellent just like their tripod. The nylon material is thick and the stitching is solid. Not a flimsy bag at all.I was skeptical of pulling the trigger because of it's price. After seeing great reviews on it, I purchased one myself which I think is the best way to store my Manfrotto 055XPROB tripod + 322RC2 ball head combination. Both fit inside just fine.The zipper is fluid. The opening is generous so you can pop the tripod in with no struggle at all.The padding is thick. Of course this comes at a price in terms of making it very bulky to handle, but this bag is not for carrying around of course. It's for storing the tripod and bringing it from storage to your vehicle and onto the shoot. It gives me confidence knowing the tripod is heavily protected from dings and scratches when handling it to and from places.After 7 years of owning this bag and tripod, I don't have any issues at all to date. Definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FU9V3WRTLJR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001AVVO8#wasThisHelpful","R2FU9V3WRTLJR4","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Sony phasing out the Move Motion Controllers due to the release of PS4 that doesn't need it, I was looking for a cheap offering of the Move Motion Controller from scouring the web and brick and mortar stores.Amazon was offering the best price for a purported brand new controller. I was skeptical at first since it isn't directly sold by Amazon, but Amazon fulfills the shipment. I purchased mine from a seller called ""Direct Distributor"" which after reading positive reviews on them, I jumped on it for an experimental one controller first.My package arrived relatively quick in an Amazon box. In it was a plain brown, compact box with a printed sticker that it was new and bulk package. Inside was the controller as well as the lanyard attachment both individually wrapped in their own plastic.Physically looks great. Charged it fully. Plugged it in the PS3 system to pair and off I went using it with no issues.As for the controller, it's a bit archaic in 2014 seeing how both PS4 and XBOX One systems have refined their process through the camera. But I'm still loving my shooting games in the PS3, not for it's authenticity but for it's arcade-style playability. I see the games in the arcade shops and I know I can play the same ones at home without having to keep on purchasing tokens to continue playing.I love how the controller can be adapted to various accessories like a steering wheel and various model guns. I don't like how bright and big the glowing ball can be. A bit obtrusive at first which gets lost once your in the zone gaming.It's a good piece of technology during it's time. I will wait for further price drop and will probably purchase two more so I can get a pair per person for some boxing arcade game this time.If only the PS4 was backward compatible in the PS3 games so I can carry over all existing Move games and accessories for the interim while we are still waiting for similar motion control games using the advanced camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZO7U4Y7QO57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0072HYRNK#wasThisHelpful","R34ZO7U4Y7QO57","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have high hopes for this product. The manufacturer seems to be especially proud of it's expanding hose offering.PROS/ Manufacturer CLAIMS:- Up to 250 PSI- Solid Brass Fittings- Kink-free- made from a ""Tuff-Guard"" multi-layer core rubber inner hose- Very lightweight. In fact it's the solid brass attachments on both ends that is basically adding the hefty weight to the hose.CONS:- Unlike a regular hose, you will need to wait and pressurize the hose in order to expand. This is the reason why there is an ON/OFF valve at the end. Once the hose has expanded, you can start to release the pressure and if the flow of water is good then the hose remains expanded. If there is not enough pressure flow, the hose may begin to contract.- It claims an up to 250 psi rating, but once you open the package the included instruction sheet specifically states in big bold letters that it cannot be used with a pressure washer. (Although unlike other reviewers on this item, it can be used with a hose attachment like a sprinkler.)- Unlike traditional hoses, there is an elaborate multi-step process in using the hose that is time-consuming in itself just for operating a simple tool - a hose. You have to ensure to expand the hose by SLOWLY opening the water source and letting it flow. This will ensure there are no kinks while the hose expands. Once fully expanded, you let the water out by opening the valve on the end of the hose. Then when you are done, you close the water source and wait for the hose to empty it's water contents as it contracts back to a compact hose.OVERALL:So you see this hose is not for everyone really. If you have a house with a big yard, I would simply go with a traditional big, bulky hose application that can be kept on a plastic reel. I live in a condo building at the heart of a Downtown city. I do not have much space to store or operate the hose. My main purpose is to wash down the car and bicycle when in need. That is why I have accepted the elaborate steps that I have to go through to operate the hose. If I were to regularly use a hose, I would not recommend going this route at all.I believe that the manufacture should, in order to garner more positive reviews and avoid negative due to misunderstanding, not only highlight it's compactness, but to come clean in announcing what it can and cannot do on the feature page as well as on the box itself. This way everything is laid out for the purchaser to see. Why force the purchase when it truly isn't for them. This will avoid returns in the process as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KZGCAO4NOVO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HD55RA8#wasThisHelpful","R3KZGCAO4NOVO5","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my second baby bathtub for my second baby. The first was a Safety 1st brand and is very similar in shape. I love how Summer has innovated on the idea by not just offering a basic infant to toddler bathtub, but by including accessories to help occupy the baby which I never had for the first.This bathtub comes with a simple-clip on toy bar with mirror. You have two attachments that hang on the clip-on bar which is a heart shape and a sun shape plastic.There are 3 stages of use for this bathtub and basically solves the problem of having to purchase multiple products throughout your baby's growth..STAGE 1: From 0 monthsIt comes with a clip-on bath sling which acts as a baby hammock. As a result it gently carries the baby on a laying down position.STAGE 2: Contoured Backrest (possibly 6 mos and up; depending on baby's size and weight)This is where you discard the sling at this point in the baby's growth, but retain the clip-on toy bar. At this stage the baby is able to sit upright on it's own and can appreciate the clip-on articles to keep her entertained.STAGE 3: TUB (up to 2 years old; depending on baby's size)You discard the clip-on bar and change the baby's position from the contoured backrest part to an upright sitting position. It now acts like a miniature tub where the length of the tub encompasses the length of the baby's legs.For our first tub, we discarded it earlier than two when our baby could comfortably not just stand but walk by himself. This way he can safely move about on the adult tub without feeling constricted. So at this point, you can use it up to stage 3 until the time you are confident enough to allow your baby to bathe in the actual tub.PROS:- Included bath sling that acts like a baby hammock- Accessories to keep baby entertained during bath time- Drain plug to safely drain water especially when using over the sink. When using over an actual tub, I just tip the whole tub over.- Soft padding on the tub.- The actual tub is made in the USA (everything else is made in China)CONS:- Not BPA-free which should be a standard for baby plastic items- One of the foam pads was not stuck together properly  and was hanging loose. I had to remove the cardboard particles that became stuck underneath the sticker portion of the pad before re-applying it on the actual plastic tub. Time will tell if this will remain stuck.- Accessories: sling pad and clip-on bar + toys are made in China which I have nothing against if the manufacturing is done right and the materials are non-toxic, but the hanging toys are questionable in quality and there is no mention of it's toxicity.OVERALL:My first tub was a blue plastic for my boy. I was excited to see this in person when it was a transparent and sparkly pink tub. Very princess-like and 100% better than that first blue tub I purchased for practically the same price.Too bad the foam pads were loose and the tub plus included accessories are not advertised as BPA free. It could have garnered all 5 stars if they gave much thought into it even at a higher price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B123CPKERUI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTUZS60#wasThisHelpful","R1B123CPKERUI5","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great alternative for my Cybex Stroller to accommodate an Infant Car Seat without having to go back to my full-size stroller. All in all it's just a simple strap with a stopper in one end and velcro in the other to wrap around the rear frame of your umbrella stroller. Based on other reviewers, they buy this for non-Cybex umbrella strollers which will work as long as the frame dimension is similar.It's a little bit archaic, but it's so simple it works. What I'm impressed with is that Cybex can make a simple strap, but can make it look and feel so elegant. I wish other manufacturers can follow suit with the build quality like this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BWKOFLXZR2IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Z6TJWG#wasThisHelpful","R3BWKOFLXZR2IL","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've shopped, tried, owned and used a couple of strollers. As a Dad who loves gadgets, I'm also looking for something sturdy, has great design, and is functional.Let's breakdown this stroller's pros and cons:PROS/FEATURES:STROLLER1. Aluminum Frame - For a full-size stroller, it is relatively lightweight and rust-free.2. One-Piece Push Handle - Easier to maneuver with one hand than strollers with two separate handles.3. One-Handed Fold - Just push the button then twist by the middle of the handle and you will be able to fold the stroller4. Drink Holder - Who doesn't appreciate a drink holder these days? In one of my strollers, I even had to buy one separately as an add-on accessory versus being included.5. Self-Standing - Not long ago it was a selling point to be self-standing. I think strollers these days should have a self-standing feature when folded as a given.6. Long and Spacious Footrest with Adjustable angle - As a full-size stroller, I expect the Spectra to have long and spacious footrest to accommodate the growing child. It does not disappoint.7. Large Storage Basket - Again, all full size strollers I expect to have a large basket underneath the stroller seat and this feature does not disappoint. You can toss in a lot of things in there.8. Child Snack/Drink Tray - You have a tray in the center as well as two cup holders for milk and water.9. Built-In Rear Mesh for Ventilation at the Hood - This serves as a ventilation as well as a peek-a-boo window to see your child while pushing around.10. Suspension for all Four Wheels - Helps provide a smoother ride for your child.11. Large Rear Wheel Lock - they call their feature a ""pedicure-friendly"" lock. It's basically a large foot rest at the rear to help your foot lock and unlock the rear stroller wheels.CAR SEAT + BASE1. SmartScreen Technology - A simple screen at the car seat base to let you know if it's installed properly.2. One-Pull Adjustment Straps - This means no need to re-thread the harness which can be a nightmare for others who need to reach at the back. I've had strollers and car seat harnesses that do both and it's not really a pain to re-thread. Although having this feature is definitely a selling point right now versus others that are not equipped with it.3. Car seat locks into the Spectra stroller without needing any adapter. A very neat feature.CONS:1. The build is crude. On the frame there are too many unsightly welding points that at this day and age I would expect a sleeker and cleaner assembly.2. Cheap plastic parts. I welcome plastic parts where it makes sense and to save on weight. There are plastics that are properly constructed and molded, and then there's those cheap toy plastic materials that gave plastic a bad rap. Unfortunately Summer Infant chose the latter route. It's so cheap that the fit and finish is typical of cheap strollers.3. Bad Build.a. Two wheels snapped on smoothly. The third wheel had to be snapped on with a little bit of force. The fourth wheel would not snap on at all. After applying frustrating force, I examined the piece and saw that the metal part that snaps on the wheel was out of alignment. It would not respond to the twisting of the plastic cap. What I did was to force it to bend with a screwdriver. Then I snapped the wheel into place. Unfortunately at this point you would not be able to remove the wheel any longer for replacement as it's stuck in there. In any case, I've never had to replace a wheel on any of my strollers. Once the wheels are done, I would assume the stroller condition is done as well. So it's not a big problem, but it does speak of the build quality and quality control.b. The plastic parts don't fit properly nor do the locking plastic parts move smoothly. The snack tray locks into place with a plastic lock and it serves as a handle. Many times the plastic tray took off on it's own without unlocking the plastic part. For the two front wheels, you can lock these as with any other stroller so they move in a straight line which is helpful in non-paved paths. Locking the wheels with these plastic parts is a big pain. They don't move down smoothly and you'll have to ensure the wheels are straight first before you are able to properly lock them. This is unlike other strollers that you can just move a switch into place with your foot and then you start to push. When the wheels are straight, they automatically lock. Really bad design and my least favorite feature of the Spectra stroller.4. Short Canopy - This is the shortest canopy I've ever seen in a stroller and is a big no-no these days to protect against the Sun and Rain. My umbrella stroller has a canopy three times as long as this one which has a neat expanding feature with a zipper. The Spectra canopy is a full size stroller and I'm severely disappointed they did not think of having a long one considering the length of the stroller. This impacts my buying decision against choosing this stroller.5. Gimmicky SmartScreen Technology Feature -  This is the first car seat base I've seen that needed batteries in order to tell me that it's installed properly. You'll probably only need the set of batteries included in the purchase for the 6 month that you'll need to use it before switching to a full size Toddler Car Seat. But still, I personally don't feel in awe with this feature and is not a selling point for my purchase. Less appealing is the basic screen that reminds me of V-Tech electronic toys. A bit crude and makes the Infant Car Seat cheap looking that it can possibly be.6. Stroller Folding Can Be Smoother - I wasn't impressed with the one-handed folding as I still needed to aid it with my foot to help bend into place the folding points. And even when it folded, it didn't snap into the plastic lock at the side. I had to force the lock into place unlike my other full-size and umbrella strollers that clicks into place. You need to do the folding action swiftly in order set the lock. If you pause halfway, then the lack of momentum won't make it lock into place as a result.OVERALL:Yes, it's cheap. Unfortunately that's how the stroller reflects in build and operation as well. There's nothing exciting about this stroller that will make me want to choose this over the others at this price point. I know not everyone can afford the top end strollers which is why there are strollers at this pricing level. I'd probably will think about getting a second-hand stroller of something twice as expensive than deal with a brand new stroller like this.I wish Summer Infant went into the stroller scene with a bang showing excellent build with a reasonable price. Instead they went with showcasing cheap strollers with a cheap manufacture.As the saying goes, you get what you pay for, which in this case rings very much true.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TKW4T3XCK9K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUV5VGS#wasThisHelpful","R2TKW4T3XCK9K5","A2HXE29CU1I24Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HXE29CU1I24Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a terrible speaker for the price. This speaker carries the moniker of ""ultimate ears"" and you think you may be getting a superior speaker based on that. You end up with quite the opposite.

"First of all: let's be honest about what this is used for 99% of the time. There's no use in hiding from it. It's become so acceptable in this society to admit it, that it's ridiculous to stand around and pretend that these devices are used for something, when they're all used for a different purpose.I love cooking, and sometimes it's impossible to get my Thyme down to a ground, powdery like substance that is easily used in the process. Furthermore, having several pieces, allowing for the kief to fall to the very bottom below a screen so it doesn't get wasted, with a spatula to collect the kief, is amazing.I had a grinder that was almost exactly like this, just bigger, and way more expensive, like 3x the price. The larger one is better if you need herbs for a group of people, but I certainly find that this one is plenty big for my own personal use.I found that the grinder was plenty sharp for my needs, and fit in my pocket very easily.I was given a HomeFlav Heavy Duty Premium Super Shredder in exchange for a fair review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GNZK6DBDMRNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFLSY24#wasThisHelpful","R3GNZK6DBDMRNH","A3J2YU2D9BH2J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J2YU2D9BH2J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great machine, and I have a lot positive to say about it, but there is one negative that causes it to lose a complete two stars! This machine can be a bit loud, which is a little bit of a turn off, but how else are you going to pump water at a high pressure? The ends fit on well, and there are plenty. All the way from broad and soft, to what I call ""Murder your gums"" are the levels that these tips go. The basin fills enough water for a quick once over, but you'll have to fill it twice if you are on a flossing mission.The great news is that flossing with this machine is much easier than conventional flossing methods. Choking your fingers by wrapping floss around your fingers seems terribly archaic. I'm not a savage. The floss picks are great, but even they are hard to get back in the back, and you tend to leave them around, which is gross. This machine makes all of that easier, and according to my dentist is effective.The big problem that I have with this machine is the button to engage the pump. It is extremely difficult to keep the button engaged and you just feel like you're mashing a button to try to keep it going. It is nothing short of a terrible design for the button, and the button alone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LTX5NMXI9YG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFQQ0U6#wasThisHelpful","R1LTX5NMXI9YG5","A3J2YU2D9BH2J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J2YU2D9BH2J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LotFancy keyboards are a must buy. These cheaper keyboards are a total and complete solution. Keyboards have a tendency to have small pits in them where liquid can pool if you spill in your laptop.

So many people call my company and tell me that they spilled into the keyboard, and everything works except that. There's usually only one or two screws, if any, under the keyboard. Then a lot of times theres some clips at the top of the keyboard that can be tricky.

I don't know what I was thinking, but I have fond memories of this album.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R176E4V3EPP091/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000008NYR#wasThisHelpful","R176E4V3EPP091","A3J2YU2D9BH2J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J2YU2D9BH2J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She said this really didn't  give her any beach waves at all.However it did leave a little shine.By the end of day her hair was  very dry.I am only going by what she told me.She really didn't smell much of a scent which was ok because she is very sensitive to any strong scents and would prefer non at all.As far as the shells at the bottom,she informed me there was none at all again that was fine with her.I did observe that as well before giving this to her.As always Diva Stuff I'm always very happy with if I wasn't I wouldn't keep reordering.They have excellent customer service as well.One reason for the two stars is because I didn't receive this particular one I ordered which is fine because I could have contacted Diva Stuff and I have no doubt they would have exchanged it for this.Two no shells at bottom and three she said it just didn't work the way she was hoping for her hair.Not to say I won't order one and try it out for myself because I may.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FVUG0BZ2GVGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017MMKYQI#wasThisHelpful","R3FVUG0BZ2GVGG","AENH50GW3OKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AENH50GW3OKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I put these Grip Master Winter gloves through the test and I will say these are thick,flexible,durable  gloves.I live in R.I. though it's Fall in the middle of October it's still been in the 50s.I decided to bring these gloves with me to our vacation rental in Vermont. Yesterday we woke up to the 30s with alot to do .First thing was climb up a ladder and clean the leaves out of the gutter Second project was cut wood and place it where it belonged. These gloves kept my hands not only warm but also protected them from cuts.These are very flexible and easy to grasp wood .Being outside for several hours in the 30s until it finally reached the upper 40s by noon ,my hands stayed nice and warm and I have to say I am surprised these gloves survived without any tears giving that they really took a beaten.These would also work great shoveling snow,and doing simple task as holding a drill.However to pick up little screws or nails would be a pain .Personally I wouldn't use for that .They do wash well in cold water just be sure you don't put them in the dryer of course as you already know the rubber would melt.They look great and plan on using them over and over again.I would recommend these.I recieved this product free in exchange for my honest review.In no way would I ever give a product 5 stars just because I recieved it free .This rating is based on my trial,and how well these gloves performed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUHJLMN0WK21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HJ4SFW#wasThisHelpful","R3LUHJLMN0WK21","AENH50GW3OKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AENH50GW3OKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have prescription medications for Allergies and repeated sinus infections.They never seem to work for me.I can't believe I have never purchased this Sinus relief Bath Bomb .why I overlooked this is beyond myself .I was desperate a few days ago to get some other type of relief besides from the medications that don't seem to work ,so I remember seeing this on Diva Stuff Amazon site and didn't think twice  I placed my order and let me say I am so beyond happy I did.This Bath Bomb really works.As I was in my tub in a daze and in severe pain I watched this bright green ball fizz .My Bathroom was filled with steam and as I was slowly inhaling the scent of the Eucalyptus, peppermint and all the other good ingredients my sinuses were Thankfully starting to clear .My headache was slowly diminishing away and my eyes were not tearing up.I just got out of my tub  a few minutes ago after letting this do its thing for about 45 minutes and I'm ready to go out tonight.I can't believe just how more effective this is than my medications .Amazing ! I am going to order more since I do suffer with sinus issues at least 4 out of 7 days a week.I definitely would suggest anyone to give this a try especially if you utilized almost everything like I have.I love the scent.Even if you are not a fan of Eucalyptus ,or mint I would still go for it and give it a try .I personally love the scent but for those who don't this certainly outweighs the pain and misery in my oppinion. Forgot to mention Diva Stuff Migraine  oil works well for those nightmare sinus headaches I carry that in my purse everywhere with me it works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24JPYNMLIUYUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R79BKT2#wasThisHelpful","R24JPYNMLIUYUS","AENH50GW3OKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AENH50GW3OKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have been using for about a week now and at first I didn't think this would be a go for me.I am trying to use all natural hair products and decided to give this a try after reading the glowing reviews.It took a few washings to get use to this but now that  I am getting use to this I love it.I have been using other natural shampoos and Conditioners without the suds and really like them.This does suds up well and I liked the results.my hair is shedding less and less,has a nice healthy shine and doesn't strip the color from my hair .That was a big concern of mine.I see why people rave about this product! Since I was and still do use another natural brand that I love as well ,my hair has been through the purging  process where all the toxin build up from styling products seem to be detoxed out of my scalp.Finally my hair is showing signs of growing a little.I can't say from this because it wouldn't happen in a week ,my guess is from a seller I purchase from that makes all their own natural products so that said I will continue using this and my other brand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJS1T59RP4HDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00937VAQE#wasThisHelpful","RJS1T59RP4HDF","AENH50GW3OKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AENH50GW3OKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Candles arrived out on the Diva Stuff site just in time for the upcoming  Holidays.I purchased two of the firewood  ones kept one for myself and gave one away.The Firewood one was great and so is this Christmas Cabin  candle.This one really brings back great Childhood memories of our Christmas.The scent is amazing.It really puts me in a Happy mood thinking of Christmas.These seem to burn nice and slow,none of that black smoke and soot.These are definitely  the best choice as far as not inhaling any of those bad Chemicals that are in your typical candle.Just for example Yankee Candle.I use to use those but my husband really hates breathing the toxins in even though they smell nice.He has asked me not to buy those anymore.Luckily he has no issues with these since they are soy and natural.So I will be happily purchasing more.Will make great gifts as well.Of course when the Candle melts down and cools off you can use the oil for a massage.It's like two in one.You can't go wrong with these..","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW7NVSO880H0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VQZGCE#wasThisHelpful","RW7NVSO880H0D","AENH50GW3OKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AENH50GW3OKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really want to use sulfate free products in my Hair.I love Diva Stuff products and I love the fact they are natural.I consider myself a customer for life .This takes a little getting use to ,but after a while I found I don't miss the suds in my hair.What I have noticed since using this and their Lime Coconut Conditioner my hair seems to have been through the purging period where the styling products ,shampoos conditioner build up is out of my scalp.My hair seems to be healthier, definitely shiny, and has grown a little.My hair has been at a stand still where it just wouldn't seem to grow anymore no matter how often I had it trimmed.My hair is about 4 inches past my shoulder where a month ago it was about 2 so I'm pretty happy.I have always had long hair but I did get quit a bit taken off a year or so ago and no matter what brands I used it wouldn't grow.I also like that this isn't one of these Conditioners  that claim to be natural and your hair will start to shed before new ones grow.I tryed one and trust me it did more damage than ever before.I will never ever again buy hair products that claim your hair will grow.So that said it does take sometime and patience to adapt to a sulfate free Conditioner ,but I have seen great results and I'm very happy.At least with Diva Stuff products you can rest assure the products are true to what they say.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QTXEKZPYM2IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIAJ31G#wasThisHelpful","R1QTXEKZPYM2IZ","AENH50GW3OKDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AENH50GW3OKDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:57 MinsWow, I am really impressed with this corset.  Its an under bust corset and I generally prefer the over bust corsets, but I absolutely love this one.  It is extremely well-made.  You can tell just by the weight of this corset that it is *extremely* well-made and its made to last.The floral design on this corset is absolutely gorgeous.  The design has a metallic sheen to it, so the product pictures really dont do it justice.  This is definitely one of those things that you need to see to truly understand what a great product this is.There is plenty of string for the ties in the back, which is a must as it makes it easier to adjust the corset to the appropriate tightness.  Theres also the back flap behind the lacing so you dont have to worry about too much skin showing if this doesnt fit perfectly or you just want a little more modesty.  This is definitely one of the nicer corsets Ive owned and even though Im not generally a big floral person, I have to admit this corset is absolutely gorgeous.I received this product for a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLV9V0I0GO192/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ONZTGI#wasThisHelpful","RLV9V0I0GO192","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:04 MinsI consider myself a bit of a selfie stick expert.as in I own more selfie sticks than one person should admit to.  I really like this selfie stick!  First off, I love the sleek design of this.  The one I got has metallic pink on the handle, which looks great with the rest of the black selfie stick.This is really easy to sync up to your Bluetooth.  All you have to do is hold down the little camera button for three seconds, until it starts blinking, then make sure your Bluetooth device (your phone) is available to other devices and scan for new devices.  Once the Bluetooth device comes up just pair them and go into your camera app and the button on the selfie stick now works as your camera shutter.I like the compactability of this selfie stick.  It folds into less than 12 inches, but has the ability to extend really far.  The phone holder piece extends enough that most phones will fit easily, even with the case on.  It fits my S5 with case just fine.

" 1:58 MinsIm gearing up for the Christmas season and one thing I hate overpaying for are gift bags.  This set of 12 bags is just under $20, which is less than $2 a bag which is a great price for quality gift bags. I hate going into the store and paying upwards of $4 or more for a gift bag so I was pretty excited to get these bags.There are 12 bags, and I received 8 different designs.  A few of the designs were doubled up, but you get a wide variety of beautiful designs. Each bag is glittered and I cant express enough how beautiful these bags are.If you watch the video you can get a better idea of the size and dimensions of each bag, but theyre very decently sized.  They all have really pretty ribbon handles, which I prefer to the braided rope or paper handles you get with some bags.  They also have a matching tag on the handle so you can label who the gift is for and who its from.  These are fantastic gift bags and I would definitely purchase again.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCUAULQO847M1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017T8P582#wasThisHelpful","RCUAULQO847M1","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:07 MinsI absolutely love overbust corsets and Im slowly building my collection and recently added this one corset to my collection.  Its not listed in the description, but this corset actually has a zipper on the side, which I LOVE. My husband loves when I dress  up in corsets for him, but sometimes it can be a pain to tie and untie the corset for it to come right back off, so I dont wear them as often as he would like. The zipper makes it super easy to take on and off without having to mess with the ties.Im never sure what size to order for corsets, but I do know they tend to run very small, so while Im generally a US size 14-16 I got this corset in a 5XL.  Well, I went a little too big this time as its very loose fitting.  Im not upset as I will probably just save this corset for my husband and with it being a little large and the zipper it is incredibly easy to get on and off.The corset itself is beautiful.  The product pictures dont do it justice and you can see in my video some up close shots of just how pretty it is.  It does come with a matching thong, which was way too big for me, but its a cute little thong.  I recommend that if you are concerned about what size to get you can contact the company as they are very helpful and in the future I will order a size down.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OY2ZRNATPXKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014AA7FV2#wasThisHelpful","R1OY2ZRNATPXKR","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A co-worker is getting ready to have her first baby boy and when I saw this set of bandana bibs I absolutely needed to get these for her!This is a set of four bibs and I honestly love all of the designs so much I cant pick a favorite one.  You get a blue and gray striped bib, a red and gray striped bib, a red bib with white stars, and a navy bib with white polka dots.  Each bib is terry cloth on the back and the front is a softer material which I guess is polyester but its really soft.  They have two snaps, so you can adjust the bib to the size of the baby which is nice as it allows you to use the bib longer.These really are very well made.  The stitching looks nice and even to me and I dont see any fraying or anything to indicate that these are less than great quality.

" 1:44 MinsI love decorating for Christmas and one of my favorite decorations is stockings.  This year I was looking for a cute set of stockings that would hang on my mantle.  Ive gotten other stockings but they havent always hung well, and I needed a set that would look cute but not be too heavy.  This 3 pack of stockings is absolutely perfect.The designs on these stockings are absolutely adorable!  The set I received has an owl, a Christmas bear, and a snowman.  All of the designs are super cute and the minute my daughter saw these she claimed the owl stocking.  Each stocking is made of felt, so while I dont doubt theyre durable, they are lightweight which is what I have been looking for.Each stocking has a little hook that works perfectly for hanging them and because the material is lightweight you dont need any extra hardware to hang these. Ive had some stockings that are made of such heavy material that even using a stocking holder they just pull the holder down.  You can watch the video and see a close up of how cute these stockings are and I threw in a picture at the end of how great they looking hanging from my mantle.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZI9KH1CGV6AS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017T5BYBC#wasThisHelpful","R2ZI9KH1CGV6AS","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Ive purchased similar tins in the past that ended up being very cheap feeling and looking, and that is not the case with these at all.  They are very well made and you can tell.  The lids come off easily, but not so easily that they will come off without being properly taken off. The lids are perfect for sticking a stick on or using a stamp to decorate however you see fit.

I get free soda at work, but we have to bring our own cups and what better to use than these adorable tumblers??There are 4 cute designs on these cups and I honestly cant decide which one is my favorite.  Probably the penguins, because who doesnt love penguins? Whats really cool about these cups is that even once Christmas is over I can still continue to use these cups as you can slip the paper design out and put in your own design.I also really like the lids on these cups. You can completely close the little sip valve which really helps prevents spills.  You can use these for hot drinks, as well as cold drinks, so again these will work great well past the Christmas season.  These would also make a really cute gift to add to a present.

" 1:03 MinsMy daughter loves fun and cute socks, so Im always looking for new socks for her and these dot socks are absolutely adorable.  I was initially going to save these for Christmas, but she needs some new socks so I went ahead and gave them to her and she loves them just as much as I do.You get 5 pairs of socks and each pair is a different set of colors. The color combos are really cute and complementary to each other, making them just that much more adorable.  Each sock has a cuff that you turn down and when you turn the cuff down there is an adorable little bow, with just a touch of sparkle.My daughter wears about a size 8 womens shoe and these socks fit her great.  Based on how they fit her I would imagine these would fit a size or two up from her size with no issues.  You can check out the video to see how they fit and really decide for yourself.

" 1:07 MinsLast year was the first year I purchased advent candles and to be honest, I was NOT impressed with the set I bought and I was seriously re-considering even having them this year, but after getting these candles Im glad I decided to try another set.These candles are 10 inches long and you get three purple and one light pink.  Theyre really very pretty candles! The wick at the top is nice and long so it is very easy to light without having to get too close or worry about burning yourself.  Ive gotten candles that the wick wont light and you end up holding the match so long it burns out or burns to the tips of your fingers.  These lit right up for me and they just look absolutely beautiful in my advent wreath.The other nice feature is the end of the candles.  They fit very well in the candle holder and Im confident they wont tip over or fall out, which can happen with candles of low quality.  I definitely recommend these candles and its nice that they are made in the USA as well!I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JES117X9WSZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017H04KWY#wasThisHelpful","R2JES117X9WSZD","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:57 MinsI absolutely love contouring; with the right contouring kit and a little practice you can do wonders with contouring.  I dont have an overly large nose, but its large enough that it sticks out to me in pictures, and with contouring Im able to camouflage this imperfection that bugs me.  In order to effectively do this a good contouring kit is a must and I have to say Im pretty impressed with this kit.You get three lighter colors, and three darker colors so regardless of your skin tone you should be able to find the right blend of colors to effectively contour.  This is a powder and if a powder is cheap and not well made it can be hard to blend properly, but Im pretty impressed with how well these powders blend.  You dont need to use a whole lot of powder to get great results, so be careful to not overdo it as a little will go a long way with this stuff.I absolutely love the case itself.  The mirror is excellent as it allow me to really get up close and blend well.  I have a large mirror in my bathroom but its over the sink so its hard to get close enough and without this mirror I often end up getting outside and realizing my blend job wasnt so great after all.  Its compact enough that it fits in my makeup bag so I can easily take it with me on trips, which is great as my other contour set is twice the size and not very convenient to travel with.  Overall, an excellent contouring set whether youre a beginner or a pro.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7O90CZKL0CP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013VZRLB6#wasThisHelpful","R3H7O90CZKL0CP","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:27 MinsThis Minion is absolutely adorable!  We have them in the crane machine at work and my daughter is always begging me for one, but Im horrible at those games so I jumped at the chance to get this one for her. I was NOT expecting this to be half the size it is!  Its so big and fluffy and huggable! I got Stuart with the one eye and my daughter fell in love with him the minute she saw him.  Shes getting to that age where shes too cool for stuffed animals, but not this one.  Hes very well made and hes all plush so hes very soft and huggable. He is way taller than 9 inches, I would guess that hes closer to 16 inches so hes a nice big huggable guy!

" 2:09 MinsI wasnt overly excited to get this led bulb, it looked cool enough but a color changing bulb just doesnt really get me all that excited.  Wow, I way underestimated how cool this bulb is! First, you have to download the app, which was super easy to download to both my tablet and my phone.  Make sure your device is visible and it connects right up.  From there you can literally change this bulb to any color you want.  I didnt realize there would be such a wide variety of color options.  Theres also a bunch of really cool presets, like party, disco, etc. and they do cool different light schemes.It functions as a regular bulb if you want it too and its pretty bright too.  I also like that you can set it up to sync to music, this would be a cool addition for a get together.  My daughter is having a slumber party soon and I know they are going to think this is the coolest thing ever.  It works in any lamp or regular light socket.  I have it in a lamp and its really just so much fun to play with.  This definitely exceeded my expectations and its much cooler than I was expecting!I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHJFKHMZCNA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R7ZS3A#wasThisHelpful","RPHJFKHMZCNA9","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:43 MinsI have a huge mantle in my living room and Im always looking for cute dcor that will look good on my mantle, especially for those off-season times when I dont have it decorate for an up-coming holiday.  This little tea light holders is absolutely adorable and a perfect addition to my mantle.First, I love that I can use my flameless tea lights and it looks like the real thing once they are in the holder.  While I love the look of tea lights Im horrible at remember to turn them off and they cause a real safety hazard for me.  Ive gotten a few tea light holders where the flameless ones dont fit very well so I was super happy that this one holds them perfectly.I love the cute little butterfly design, and its even cute once you have the tea light in and turned on.  Depending on where you have the holder set up it will cast pretty little butterfly shadows.  This is a great little dcor piece to add to your house, and I know it will look cute on my patio come summer as well.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHXQ2X3XTK0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0170Z4EG8#wasThisHelpful","R2RHXQ2X3XTK0J","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:38 MinsIm normally a 14-16 so I got the 4XL in this to ensure it would fit, and it does fit very well.  I absolutely love the color and feel of this body shaper.  I have several body shapers and I have to admit this is probably my favorite one at this point.  Its really well made and I got the navy blue one and it has pretty gold accents and lets face it most body shapers are more functional than they are pretty, so its nice to have a pretty body shaper.So the crotch hole is a little weird, but I absolutely love that it has this.  I cant count the number of times I have spent 10-15 minutes in the bathroom at a wedding undoing my undergarments just to go to the bathroom and with this you can easily go to the bathroom without taking off the entire shaper; major plus for me.The sizing chart on this is a little off, but Ive gotten other corsets from this company before so I had a good idea of what size to order.  As I said Im a 14-16 and the 4XL fits me fantastically, so if you plan on purchasing this maybe use that to go off of.  Im a 40DD in the chest if that helps as well.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWIN8XKMAE55V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJDF2X0#wasThisHelpful","RWIN8XKMAE55V","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:27 MinsBoth my husband and I have Bluetooth speakers that we use almost daily and my daughter has started to express a desire to have one in her room for her own use, so when I saw this one with the fun, flashing lights I knew it would be perfect for her.I didnt realize that in addition to this being Bluetooth, that you could listen to the radio through it; I kind of found this out by accident by playing with it.  This is a great feature as my daughter doesnt have a huge music collection yet and so she can listen to the radio if she wishes.The flashing lights are really cool!  You can adjust the different light settings, but the lights will match up to the beat of the music, which is just kind of neat.  This would be great to add a fun atmosphere to any get together, but honestly my daughter just loves playing with it in her room.The sound quality is decent enough for a Bluetooth in this price rangedont expect the quality of a $200 Bluetooth from a $40- $70 Bluetooth and you will be pleased as well.  Overall, this is a great speaker thats super easy to use and I love that it doesnt run on batteries and you can just plug it in to use.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased reviews","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15GB8MLIMORNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YW7Y6K2#wasThisHelpful","R15GB8MLIMORNI","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:11 MinsI have purchased a few scooters from a major scooter company, that shall remain nameless, but I have to say that these scooters blow those scooters out of the water.  This three wheel style is so much easier for little ones to use, than the traditional 2 wheel scooter.I got this particular scooter for my niece for Christmas, but as soon as it arrived my 9 year old was super excited and wanted to test it out.  I wanted to make sure the scooter was made well and worked correctly as by the time this is gifted it will be past the return window so I decided to let her give it a try.  We kept it inside so there wouldnt be visible wear and tear on it, it is a present after all. Its super easy to adjust, and my only regret is that I didnt realize this would work just as well for my 9 year old as for my 3 year old niece because now my daughter wants one!This scooter is fantastic!  I find this design to be more kid friendly than a lot of the all metal scooters out there, and its much easier to fold than other scooters weve had.  The light up wheels are super cool and are probably my daughters favorite part.  This is definitely a great first scooter for little ones as its much easier to control than other scooters weve owned.  Overall, this is a fantastic scooter and I recommend it for any kid from 3 to 10 years as long as they meet the height and weight requirements.  My daughter is super tall for her age (almost as tall as me) so this is a little small for her, but for a 9 year old of average height this would work great. I tried to get video of the flashing lights but my daughter wasn't being the most cooperative, but they're definitely really cool in person!I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R353717F0CMUM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXO33VS#wasThisHelpful","R353717F0CMUM1","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:21 MinsThis is the deluxe kit of the Fastrim Roller and I was pretty excited to test this kit out.  I absolutely love the handle for the smaller rollers. You can adjust this handle to any angle you need by simply snapping out the red piece, positioning the handle to the angle you need and then snapping the red piece back in.  Its really that easy.  At first I was a little afraid to pull it out as I thought I was going to break it, but no worries you wont break it so dont be afraid to pull it out.The roller frame included in this kit is quite possibly the best frame Ive ever used.  Im no professional painter, but both myself and my friend helping me paint agreed that this was a better frame than other ones weve bought from hardware stores.  I like the knock it off system as its really easy to get paint filled rollers off without getting paint all over you.  The rollers included are meant for acrylic paint, so keep that in mind.  We were using latex paint so we chose to use a different roller and save those for our next project with acrylic paint.As for the Fastrim roller system..I cant stress this enough: Watch the videos and follow the instructions!  I did not.  I decided to just test it and go and Ill be honest I wasnt thrilled at first.  But I really really wanted this product to work well so I decided to go back and watch some of the videos on Youtube on how to properly load and use the roller.  This made a world of difference.  I am now completely confident in my ability to use this roller correctly, and when used correctly you really can skip the taping.  There are obviously always going to be some areas that its best to tape off but for the most part you can easily get away without taping off IF you use this correctly.The roller and handle fit in the tray perfectly so you can just snap the lid on and it keeps your paint from drying out.  This is great for me as I often dont finish painting projects all in one go.  Overall, this is a terrific kit as long as you use it properly and I love the knock it off frame!I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IYY52ZNTOOQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUJ41YO#wasThisHelpful","R1IYY52ZNTOOQF","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:17 MinsIm a huge fan of pink, but Ive also learned that pink needs to be accented with other colors so its not overwhelming, especially when it comes to purses, which is why I love this set so much.  Pictures really do NOT do this set justice. Generally when it comes to purses and such Im not huge into patterns and prints, but this one really caught my eye and I was hoping when it arrived that it wouldnt be too much and end up sitting in my closet un-used. I cant begin to tell you how darn cute this set is!  I really like the structure and design of the main bag.  It seems like a lot of purses and made to be kind of big shapeless, soft blobs, but this purse has actual structure to it.  If I set it down its going to stay standing up and not fall all over the place like some of my purses do now.  It has handles or you can add a strap to it, which is nice.The middle size bag can be used with or without the strap as well.  I personally could see myself using this to carry essentials while traveling, but it would also work great as like a cross body bag when I just need to carry a few things.The little wristlet is absolutely adorable!  The strap is removable so it can easily double as a makeup or change purse to go with the larger bags.  The entire set is extremely well made and just gorgeous to me.  There are so many accents that really pull this purse together, from the red trim to the little diamond accents, I absolutely love it!I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R323XMEPI24AK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSBF0U4#wasThisHelpful","R323XMEPI24AK5","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:10 MinsMy husband is a firm believer that everyone should have a good pocket knife so when he found out a friend of ours didnt have a pocket knife he insisted we get him one and it just so happens the opportunity came up to check out this Coleman knife.Im no expert of knives, but even I can tell you this is a cool looking pocket knife. I left it up to my husband to test out the particulars of this knife, but I can tell you that I like how it looks.  Its not too heavy and its easy to use and has the clip so it can be clipped to your waistband or belt.My husband tested out the blade and said its pretty sharp and he was impressed with the blade.  He said the locking mechanism was good and worked well, so thats a plus.  He *almost* decided to keep this knife for himself but he has like 4 other ones so he finally relented that this would make a first great pocket knife for our friend.  Overall, its a nice knife and it works well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N2ITRHL13KHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJDJS30#wasThisHelpful","R2N2ITRHL13KHB","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:39 MinsIve had the opportunity to test out a couple of action cameras like this one and I have to say this is my absolute favorite one so far.  I was immediately impressed when I opened this one and saw the case it came in.  It comes in a durable canvas case that holds all of the little accessories and has a spot for the camera, so its all very neat and organized.  This is far superior than trying to keep track of all of the mounts and brackets with the other cameras Ive gotten.  This makes it much easier to take it on the go and have all of the pieces that you need.As far as the camera goes, it is on par quality wise with the other cameras I have.  The functions are relatively easy to figure out.  It does NOT come with a memory card, which you need for the camera to be functional, so make sure you have one of those handy.  The accessories are equal to other kits in the same price range, and will cover all of the basic mounts and brackets you need to have a functional action camera.Overall, the camera quality is decent and its easy to use. You get a wide variety of accessories and the case is a must have that sets this set above other kits Ive gotten.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R100X3GR2PVCHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NY5Q9W#wasThisHelpful","R100X3GR2PVCHN","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:05 MinsThis is a really great tablet thats perfect for little ones.  This tablet comes with a bumper case, so it will protect he tablet from little fingers dropping it.  It does seem to have a screen protector to protect it from scratches, but I definitely recommend finding a tempered glass screen protector.The best thing about this tablet is the kid-friendly environment that can easily be controlled by the parent.  Allowing your young child access to the internet can be a scary thing, but there are so many great resources out there for kids that I know I want my child to have access to.  With the Childrens World set up of this tablet it is so easy for me, as the parent, to easily control what apps and internet sites my child has the ability to access.  I can also easily set time limits so I can monitor how much time is spent on the internet.What I also love is that you can easily use this as a regular tablet, not just the Childrens World set up. This truly is a tablet that can grow with your child and you can switch to the regular tablet setup when you feel your child is old enough.Its pre-loaded with google play and fully functional to work in tandem with google, which is a must for me.  The cameras are pretty decent and the battery seems to last for a pretty decent amount of time.

" 1:27 MinsWow, can I just say this headlamp really blew away my expectations. We have to use headlamps to get deep cleaning done properly at work and Ive gotten some really lame headlamps.  This one is amazing.First off, this is probably the brightest headlamp Ive ever used.  I love that it has three settings.  While I will primarily use the high setting at work, I will be keeping this particular headlamp for my own personal use as well and I think this would be great for camping as well.I love that you can re-charge this via a wall charger or a car charger..the headlamps we currently have eat through batteries like no other and I LOVE that this is re-chargeable.  Its actually way more comfortable than I was expecting it to be; the headband is really stretchy and can be easily moved around to what feels most comfortable for you.I received the re-chargeable batteries (you do need to buy the charger for the batteries separately), a car charging cord, and the wall charging cord.  Oh it also came with a USB cord.  You can hook it up to your phone and if your batteries are dead it will run off of your phone, but I imagine the battery life wouldnt be that long.Overall, Im pretty impressed with this headlamp.

Its also great because its compatible with my Samsung Galaxy, making it easy to transfer all of my photos onto this drive  I used to have to transfer to my google drive, then transfer to a usb and now I can transfer directly to this hard drive.Overall, this is a great enclosure; its super sleek looking, it fits all of my needs and works great!I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37SA4Y8ME4GK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011TX62KS#wasThisHelpful","R37SA4Y8ME4GK5","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So Ive played with a few mini quad copters, but this is the largest one Ive had the chance to use and I have to admit it kind of intimidated me.  Im not very good at flying the little oneswhy would I have any better lucky flying a big one right?Few pieces of advice..start off flying the basic model before adding the fancy accessories.  Trust me, its really cool that you can use this in 4 different modes but I totally recommend getting the basics down in an enclosed area first.  I played with it in my living room for quite a bit just to get a feel for it and for the remote and how to control speed, etc.So, while this may look like a toy keep in mind that this toy is not for little ones.  Those little blades can really hurt when theyre going and Ive been lucky enough to only get caught by one of them once but man did it hurt.  Those propellers move really fast and if you grab it at full speed you will most likely cut you.  This is NOT a defect with the droneits simply not made to be a childs toy.I havent tested out the camera function a whole lot yet, other than to ensure it works. I dont really want to take a bunch of pictures of my living room.

" 1:08 MinsMy husband and I have very different body temperatures and while hes often sweating, Im freezing and frankly regular comforters just werent cutting it for me.  He constantly has to have a fan going and he cant sleep if hes hot, and I end up shivering to death with two comforters, so I decided it was time to get a down comforter.First off, I was really impressed with the design of this down comforter.  It has a really nice white striped design that allows you to use it without a duvet cover if you choose, and still have pretty bedding.  Im not very good with keep white things white, so this will be going in a duvet cover, but its still really pretty.Can I just tell you how warm and cuddly this blanket is??  I no longer need two blankets to keep me warm. Weve had several issues with our heating system in the past month, and it often gets down to 67 degrees in my house at night.this may not sound too bad to most, but Im a firm 72 degree girl so this is practically arctic to me and this down comforter keeps me warm and comfy all night long.I got the king size and it fits my bed perfectly and the filling seems to be very consistent so its not lumpy or weird looking.

I have to admit, I totally got this because come on..how could you have a sense of humor and NOT get this??I would fully recommend that if you have small children, maybe keep your new friend in a more discreet location, but he does make a handy ring holder.  I actually have him set inside my night stand so I can slip my wedding ring on his appendage before I go to bed at night.This guy would make a PERFECT bridal shower or bachelorette gift.  Or for that one friend that loves over the top crazy stuff.yup this is perfect for them.  Its definitely well made and sturdyI was a little afraid his appendage would break if you put more than one ring on itbut hes definitely a tough not so little guy.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36G5BN2MNM3CN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W77USXI#wasThisHelpful","R36G5BN2MNM3CN","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:28 MinsI bought one of those over-priced exercise trackers a few months backand it is literally collecting dust somewhere.  Sometimes it really is best to just stick with the basics, which is what makes this pedometer so great.  We all know that we should strive to walk 10,000 steps a day to maintain a healthy, active lifestyle right?This is a simple, easy to use pedometer to help ensure you are reaching those daily goals.  It has a little clip so you can easily clip it to the band of your pants for the best accuracy.  You dont need belt loops, which is great as a lot of female dress pants actually dont have belt loops.  I can clip it to the band of my pants and it seems to work just as accurately.Its easy to use, it fits comfortable on your waist band and its not overly complicated or bulky, making it a great pedometer to me.  I know there are more complicated, fancy devices out there, but if youre like me and just looking to track that 10,000 step goal this is the perfect pedometer for that.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6WLXJ9WZFFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MHWX78#wasThisHelpful","R2R6WLXJ9WZFFG","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:28 MinsFull disclosureI didnt get these to use as pacifier clips.  My niece doesnt use a pacifier but she chews on EVERYTHING these days.  While Im sure these work awesomely as pacifier clipsthey work fantastically for teething babies that want to shove everything in their mouth.These can easily be clipped to anythingincluding a little ones shirt.  We can easily clip this to my nieces shirt and rather than her trying to shove everything in her mouth, she focuses in on these pretty, colorful beads.  Theyre absolutely a safe material for little ones to teeth on and theyre super cute too!The beads are the perfect color and texture to grab a little ones attention and keep their focus off of things that shouldnt be going in their mouth.  If your child happens to use a pacifier you get the added bonus of this being a pacifier clip, but dont count these beads out if your child doesnt use a pacifier.My sister has a ton of teething necklaces for when shes holding my niece, but these are great for when my niece is in her car seat or stroller. Theyre a great way to keep your little one occupied too as the different shapes and bright colors really catch their attention.

" 2:39 MinsIve had the opportunity to test out a couple of action cameras like this one and I have to say this is my absolute favorite one so far.  I was immediately impressed when I opened this one and saw the case it came in.  It comes in a durable canvas case that holds all of the little accessories and has a spot for the camera, so its all very neat and organized.  This is far superior than trying to keep track of all of the mounts and brackets with the other cameras Ive gotten.  This makes it much easier to take it on the go and have all of the pieces that you need.As far as the camera goes, it is on par quality wise with the other cameras I have.  The functions are relatively easy to figure out.  It does NOT come with a memory card, which you need for the camera to be functional, so make sure you have one of those handy.  The accessories are equal to other kits in the same price range, and will cover all of the basic mounts and brackets you need to have a functional action camera.Overall, the camera quality is decent and its easy to use. You get a wide variety of accessories and the case is a must have that sets this set above other kits Ive gotten.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24FXJ39EMC3AG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OF617G#wasThisHelpful","R24FXJ39EMC3AG","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:23 MinsI hate manual pencil sharpenersI always end up with one side that sharpens and the other side doesnt and my pencils never work right, so I was hoping this electric sharpener would work a little better.  It definitely does.My husband was kind enough to show me that when using this you need to not let the pencil spin or it will not sharpen evenly.  You kind of just want to push the pencil down in there and it will get it nice and sharp.  If you just let it spin it does NOT sharpen nearly as well.The only real down side to this sharpener is it takes FOUR AA batteries.  Thats a lot of batteries for a pencil sharpener to me.  Im hoping that the batteries last for some time.  I do like that you get extra blades too.  Oh and the shavings stay in the little canister until you dump them and they dont get everywhere.

" 0:24 MinsI originally got this hat for my daughter, but honestly I kind of want to keep it for myself.  Im not normally into winter hats with pom poms on them, but this hat is seriously so freaking cute!I was really impressed with the overall quality of the hat.  Its nice and thick.  A lot of times you get super cute hats like this that look great but dont actually offer a whole lot of protection from the weather, but this hat will for sure keep you warm and comfy.I love the design too! I may have mentioned it, but I think its absolutely adorable!  I love the fact that the back is split, so it doesnt totally mess up your hair, but allows the side flaps to lay flat and cover your ears keeping them nice and warm.  Even if the poms are a little much for you, you could easily remove them and still have a really adorable hat that will keep your head nice and warm!I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CUPVZF8WI3E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYYZ7OC#wasThisHelpful","R2CUPVZF8WI3E8","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:31 MinsLet me just start by addressing the smell.  Maybe I got lucky, but I didnt think there was a huge smell with these.  Honestly, if you get a set of makeup brushes the first thing you should do is wash them anyway.  They are made in a factory and they should be cleaned before use, which would eliminate any smell there may be.  If you havent washed makeup brushes before, you can buy makeup brush cleaner, or use baby shampoo.I think the set is very well made.  The bristles are super soft, and they arent falling out of the brushes.  The handles are nice and its a great looking set. Heres the thingif you arent familiar with makeup brushes you may be a little lost when it comes to these brushes and think theyre all the same.  While they are similar each brush does have its own use.  This is a great set of brushes, especially for someone just getting into makeup, but take the time to know the tools you are working with and what they are used for.  These are primarily face brushes that are great for applying foundation, powder and concealer so keep that in mind if you choose to purchase them.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KEGYK49JQAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3VHKVK#wasThisHelpful","R31KEGYK49JQAP","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:45 MinsAs a family we take a lot of road trips as our nearest family lives 4 hours away.which inevitably means my husband takes a nap while I drive.  He constantly complains about cramps in his neck from sleeping funny on these trips, so when I saw this pillow I decided to get it for him so at least then I wouldnt have to listen to him complain!Its kind of a funny looking pillow.  Its long and skinny and it has an adjustable strap, so the cool thing is you can place it to best fit your sleeping position and then strap it in place so it stays.  The inside is those super squishy micro beads that are super comfortable.Quite possibly my most favorite feature is that you can remove the cover and wash it.  I admit it.Im a drooler and if Im taking a nap in the car chances are Ive got makeup on and I could see this getting soiled quite easily, so its a must that the cover is removable and easy to wash.

My husband immediately snagged like 10 for his welding helmet and tool box. My daughter is getting a scooter for Christmas and I guarantee you her scooter will quickly be adorned with these stickers.I m also super impressed with the quality of these stickers.

So when I was given the opportunity to get this pie dish I was pretty excited.I was a little concerned about getting an all glass one, as Im not the most graceful person, but honestly its so beautiful that Im glad I went ahead and got the glass one.  Its also a really thick, sturdy glass thats not going to break or chip easily.  You can tell from the weight of the pie dish that its not going to easily break.I absolutely love the decorative edging; It should also make it easier to press out the crust.

" 0:41 MinsMy stepson has an Iphone and up until recently he's had a heavy duty case for his phone, but I recently got him a tempered glass screen protector so we figured he would be okay getting a less heavy duty phone case.  Don't get me wrong, I still wanted a sturdy, durable case, but it didn't need to be a brick.I'm really impressed with this case. It's a nice protective case that will keep his phone safe from falls.  I definitely recommend using a tempered glass screen protector with this case, but it will definitely do a good job of protecting the body of the phone.The kickstand is a neat touch; it's great for watching videos which my stepson does all the time.  I also liked the extras it came with.  It  comes with a stylus, a regular screen protector, and a microfiber cloth to clean the screen with.

My husband is currently working on building his workshop in the garage and this is literally perfect for his shop.  He has a ton of hand tools that have magnetic properties that he can hang on this.Yes, this does work extremely well for knives.  The knives stick on this very well and you dont have to worry about them falling off or creating a hazard.  It comes with all of the necessary hardware to hang up, including the wall anchors, which is nice.The magnets are really strong, which is the most important part of this.  The last thing you want is to rely on a magnet to hold up a sharp knife or tool and it not work well.

The colors are just as bright and colorful in person as in the product picture and the design is beautiful.I love the versatility of this set as well.

I could also see myself using this for so many other uses.  We always have a ton of pens, markers, etc.on the counters and this would work awesomely as a holder for them.

I was a little skeptical about how it would work and the ease of use, but it's so easy to use.It comes with a little cd, you stick it in your computer, let it set up and you can see whatever is on the end of the endoscope  I actually took video of how easy it is to use and of course, the inside of my mouth.  Once you have it all set up, you can stick that endoscope down anything any be able to see it on your computer.  You can take video or pictures too.It comes with some little extra's like a magnet, a mirror, and a small hook.  I'm pretty sure there's an animal under my deck and this little endoscope is going to help me find out what's under there.

"I love these fishnet stocking lingerie outfits; Ive tried several different ones and this one is pretty great.  I had two concerns about this outfit when I purchased it and Ill address those in my review.It states one size fits most, but lists a weight of 88 lbs to 150 lbs, I weight about 30 lbs more than that so I was worried it wouldnt fit.  I took the chances as Ive found most of these types of body stockings are very forgiving and fit a wide range of body shapes and sizes.  Im not foolish enough to think its going to look exactly like the model when I weigh a bit more than her, so considering Im really pleased with how this looks and fits.My other concern was going to be that it was going to be complicated to put on as its a little more detailed than other ones I have bought before.  Once I pulled it out, I just made sure I had the top and bottom figured out and it was relatively easy to put on.  Start with putting your legs through the torso section, get the bottoms situated and then put the top part on.  These are also much sturdier than like regular nylons and are less likely to get a run in them.

" 1:45 MinsIf you own a fit bit then you know how easy they can be to lose and I definitely recommend getting these bands!  I got the 7 pack, so I literally have a color for every occasion/outfit that I can think of.  I love the fun colors it comes with, but I also like that theres basic black and white that are a little more work appropriate.Its also super easy to pop your fit bit in and out.  I tried doing it from the back but its much easier if you just pop it in through the front.  And it holds it really securely once its in place.  I actually feel like my fitbit works better with it on my wrist than clipped to me so thats an added bonus. But if youre concerned about accuracy you could loop this through a belt loop and it would still be more secure than the little clip it comes with.These are made from a really soft silicone so theyre super comfortable too.  I dont really like wearing regular watches because the bands rub on my wrist, but this is really comfortable to wear.

Let me start by saying I'm a drugstore mascara girl all the way.  I can't bring myself to pay more than twenty dollars  for a tube of mascara, and to be honest even fourteen dollars is a little much for me.  I think I generally pay in the ten dollar or so range for mascara.So here's the deal..I don't know if the mascara I'm currently using sucks so much that it makes this mascara look fantastic, or if this mascara is just that fantastic. I suggest you watch the video and really make your own opinion, but I can tell you this mascara seemed to make my eyelashes more defined and better looking.

I was little concerned that this necklace might not quite be the quality I wanted as its really affordable, but after receiving it I absolutely love it!This is an absolutely beautiful necklace.  Its so much shinier and sparkly in person than the product picture shows.  The locket is really easy to open, so you can place little charms or a picture in there.  You can really customize this however you want.  I plan on placing some charms for my mom in there.

" 1:44 MinsI got a fitbit a few months back and to be totally honest I havent used it nearly as much as I would like to, simply because its far too easy to lose.  When you get the fit bit it fits in this little case that you clip on you. Well because the fitbit is so tiny its very easy to not realize it has fallen off.  I used it at the gym twice and both times almost lost it because it fell off. So its been honestly sitting on my dresser for the past few months.Well, then I was given the chance to test out these bands. I absolutely love them!  This set comes with a pink and a black.  I love the pink as it is fun and my favorite color, and I love that it comes with a simple black band, which is a little more appropriate for work than my pretty pink one.At first I tried sliding the fitbit in through the back of the band, but it actually works better if you just slide it in the front.  Ive always been horrible at putting watches on, but this wasnt nearly as bad to get put on as I thought.  You just have to click the two little pieces in place.

"I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 which is USB 3.0 capable and I absolutely love the cord that come with it.  It charges so much faster, and I've been on the hunt for another cord for work.  I found this two pack, which is awesome because with a two pack I have one for work AND my car.  My biggest concern was that this wasn't going to work as well as my original cord.Ok, so I tested this cord versus my original cord. Within 10 minutes this cord charged my phone a full 10%.  I didn't use my phone during this time, but my phone was getting notifications etc....Then I charged my phone with the original cord and it charged 13% in 10 minutes.  Now, I did noticed I didn't get any notifications during that 10 minutes, so that may make up for the 3% difference. Definitely a must have if you have USB 3.0 capability for your phone! So then I tested it with a normal charging cord.  In 10 minutes my phone charged 5%.  So obviously this cord is far superior than a normal charging cord.  I'd like to note that the normal cord I used is a nylon usb cord and it charges much quicker than a non nylon cord, so the fact that this cord is still so much faster says a lot about the quality of this cord.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14SLJXX25UJKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T29A6XG#wasThisHelpful","R14SLJXX25UJKX","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:51 MinsThese little pouches are fantastic.  To be honest when I ordered them I was like hmm...what am I going to do with 6 pouches when I only have one pair of sunglasses??  Honestly, these are a great way to protect a variety of items.  I recently got a little accessories kit for my cell phone and it's like three different lenses and the pouch it came with is a little on the small side, so this one is perfect.You get 6 total; 3 gray and 3 black.  Each one is made of a quality microfiber material so it won't scratch up whatever you store in it.  They also have a drawstring so you can close them nice and tight and keep them from falling out of the pouch.  These would also be great for storing jewelry in when traveling.  Overall, these are great pouches that are well-made and have a variety of uses.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IE15YOVCKKQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016O8LLOK#wasThisHelpful","R2IE15YOVCKKQ7","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:03 MinsMy fireplace has these little hooks that are perfect for hanging lights, which is great for holidays.  Last year I hung plain Christmas lights, but it still seemed like something was missing, so when I saw these adorable lights I had to try themThese were a little bit of a pain to untangle, but once I got them untangled they were super easy to hang. They look absolutely adorable.  I like that these are battery operated so I dont need to have an extension cord hanging down from the lights to an outlet.These also have several different sight settings which is really cool; there are literally eight different settings so you can pick and choose.  I also like that you can turn them off, so during the day I can just have the pretty decorations and not burn through batteries.  Im super excited for decorating for the holiday season and these are a great start.Just a note, I noticed that one of the balls was missing and I contacted the seller just to let them know and they are sending me an ENTIRELY NEW set at no cost.

" 0:26 MinsIf you have yet to switch over to using nylon phone charging cords you are totally missing out. This cord quite simply put, is awesome.  This cord is superior to traditional usb cords in pretty much every way possible.  Not only do I find that the nylon cords charge your phone significantly faster, but theyre far more durable than the other type of cord.  I like this cord because it has the little lights that lets you know the status of your phone charging.  Plus, I just like thing with pretty lights.Ive used this to charge my Galaxy S5, my husbands S3, my kindle, my tablet, and my daughters kindle and it works well on all of our devices.

" 1:45 MinsIf you own a fit bit then you know how easy they can be to lose and I definitely recommend getting these bands!  I got the 7 pack, so I literally have a color for every occasion/outfit that I can think of.  I love the fun colors it comes with, but I also like that theres basic black and white that are a little more work appropriate.Its also super easy to pop your fit bit in and out.  I tried doing it from the back but its much easier if you just pop it in through the front.  And it holds it really securely once its in place.  I actually feel like my fitbit works better with it on my wrist than clipped to me so thats an added bonus. But if youre concerned about accuracy you could loop this through a belt loop and it would still be more secure than the little clip it comes with.These are made from a really soft silicone so theyre super comfortable too.  I dont really like wearing regular watches because the bands rub on my wrist, but this is really comfortable to wear. I was a little worried that the clasp mechanism wouldnt stay well, but its actually really secure. I definitely recommend these to anyone who has a fit bit.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AC4L1QVNFB6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PZT9RY#wasThisHelpful","R2AC4L1QVNFB6F","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I got the daylight bright bulbs as I prefer the really bright white color, but if you prefer the more traditional warm light they have that option too.

" 1:17 MinsThese gift bags are super adorable!  There are 16 bags in this set; 2 each of 8 different designs. You will get the exact designs that are pictured, which is great because I hate when you get a set of gift bags, and the front one is super cute and you open the package and the rest are not so much.  No worries, theyre all really cute!I like that theres also a wide variety of designs that would work for virtually anyone you would want to give a gift to.  There are a few designs that would even work really well for kiddos, but they arent so kiddish that you couldnt use them for an adult.The bags are also really well made.  The paper is really thick, so theyre less likely to tear easily, and the handles are really strong too.  Nothing is worse than getting your present all cute and set up in a gift bag and then the bag rips.  I mean, I wouldnt recommend putting in a few bricks and expecting it to hold up, but it should hold up well for most presents.  These are medium sized backs so theyre a pretty decent size that would fit a variety of presents.  You would easily pay upwards of $3 or more per bag for a bag comparable to this one in store, so this is a fantastic deal!I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL1EPNPAXPIZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016NNW6NG#wasThisHelpful","RL1EPNPAXPIZ1","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:30 MinsI have a small addiction to hair bows and I love when I find a good brand that makes quality hair pieces.  Ive purchased several sets of hair bows from this company, and Ive loved every single set Ive received and these are no exception.The clips for the flowers are attached very well, so they wont fall apart after wearing them one or two times, and youre little one isnt going to be able to easily pull them off either.  You get a wide variety of colors, and a bunch of different shades of popular colors like pink; you can never have too many shades of pink!I used to make hair accessories and every time I get a new set of hair accessories from this company Im astounded that their products are not only affordable, but well-made too.

" 3:32 MinsSo I really wanted to love this set.  The concept is really neat.  Basically you have a coloring book, you can then scan that colored picture in and use an app to continue coloring or change your coloring page.  And while I do like it, I dont love it.The concept is amazing.  You color a picture, scan it in and then you can edit it.  Thats super easy to use and set up.  I definitely recommend registering.  I used my tablet to enter in the special code, and then tried to use it on my phone but because I hadnt set up an account I couldnt use the code again.  So the codes are one time use so make sure you link them to your account!I have a tablet and I had mixed results with the stylus and the app in general.  It wasnt super easy to color with.  I then downloaded the app to my phone, and it seemed a lot easier to use.  Im not sure why the difference, but the stylus did not work well with my tablet at all.Overall, this is a neat concept for little ones.  I think bigger ones would get frustrated as its not the easiest to get your coloring exact. Now, I will say the photo booth option is awesome.  My daughter had a blast playing with that and its a really neat feature on the app. She liked that she could add ponies to her selfie and then color them.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGOSOSJOPUI4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9657641020#wasThisHelpful","RGOSOSJOPUI4L","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love making guacamole, but I dont often do it as Im not very good at peeling the avocadoes and I end up wasting more than I end up with, so it gets kind of costly for me.  I was hoping that this tool would make it easier for me to get the filling out and make it a lot easier.and it definitely has.The slicer part looks like plastic, but dont let it fool you; its much sharper than I was expecting and works perfectly for cutting through the skin of the avocado.  The pitter works excellent and pulls the pit right out, and then you can just use the scraper to get all the goodness out.Ive only used it to make guacamole so far but Im sure it would make the process of slicing avocadoes easier as well.  Its dishwasher safe too, which is always a plus for me because I hate washing anything by hand.

" 0:31 MinsIve recently started growing my wig collection, and I believe this is the 5th one I have added to my collection and it is far and away my absolutely favorite.  I got the red wine color and the color is phenomenal!  Its just a really pretty shade of red and I absolutely love it.When I pulled this wig out and went to put it on I was absolutely amazed by how soft this wig is.  Out of all of the wigs I own, this is the only one I can run my fingers through without them getting caught. I didnt brush it out or anything; if you watch the video I took the video without doing anything to the wig.  Its just that easy and manageable.This was also one of the easier wigs for me to put on.  My daughter likes to try my wigs on and its generally a bit of a process to help her get the wigs on, but she was able to put this on with minimal help from me.  This really is a fantastic wig and should I add to my collection again in the future this would most definitely be the company I go with.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JKDTLVZF1A7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015E0LFSG#wasThisHelpful","R1JKDTLVZF1A7C","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:02 MinsI have a really neat backseat organizer that goes across the back of my third row seating, but that often means my daughter has to reach around to put in or take items out of it, so I wanted to find one that could go right on the back of the seat in front of where she sits. I decided to give this organizer a shot because I really liked that it said it doesnt sag.This organizer really is so much sturdier than ones Ive used in the past and its really easy to install.  You clip the strap around the headrest, then you can actually use the hooks to clip underneath the seat, and to make it even sturdier you can pull the other strap around the seat (it fits in between the seat so its not uncomfortable for the person sitting in that seat) and secure it in place.  It really is sturdy once you have all three locking mechanisms in place.It has a ton of storage too. It has a zipper pocket at the top, which would be great for crayons etc..so they dont get everywhere! Then there are compartments that could easily store drinks, snacks etc.and if thats not enough theres a third row of storage.  I am hoping this will encourage my child to keep her stuff in the organizer and not all over my car.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF9D2TZL7ZIIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016BK23O8#wasThisHelpful","RF9D2TZL7ZIIG","A80TXV9F8ORDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80TXV9F8ORDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:18 MinsMy husband is a smoker and we have a general no smoking policy in our home, but he sometimes breaks that rule by smoking in our bedroom.  The smell tends to linger in our room and I wanted a way to get some of that smell out, but I didnt want to have to get a big bulky purifier as it doesnt happen often.  I decided to give this a try as its small and discreet and it has a multitude of uses.I initially set it up in our bedroom to help filter out the smoke smell, but since using it weve noticed a lot of other beneficial uses.  My husband recently had surgery on his nose to correct a deviated septum and is still in the healing stage and has had a lot of issues with his sleeping and breathing during healing.  Since using the diffuser he has noticed an easier time sleeping as he feels he can breathe better.This also works great as a diffuser with essential oils.  I can add in a few drops of lavender for sleeping, or some lemon for a fresh, clean smell.  It will run continuously for up 6 hours it doesnt totally turn off, but does stop running.  I also really like that you can change the color to the color of your choice or turn it off completely.  I like the light; my husband thinks it is annoying, so he can easily turn it off which is nice.

"Anyone lucky enough to find a copy of this traditional Hungarian cookbook will indeed discover a treasure chest of great and easy to follow recipes as long as they are already familiar with various cooking techniques. I bought my book in Hungary in 1975 or 1981. It is a paperback with a photo of a roasted suckling pig on the cover that has an apple in its mouth. Mine is a second edition in superb condition published by Corvina Press in Budapest in 1969 (original was published in 1958). The book is a mere 158 pages long, written in English, has a very fine index with well organized chapters. The first chapter explains the history of Hungarian cooking, the next one describes special techniques of the Hungarian kitchen and the main contents of the book are recipes for well known Hungarian dishes, meats, soups, vegetables, scones/muffins and desserts.I enjoyed reading the history of Hungarian cooking as it relates to history. Especially enjoyed reading about the popular, staple foods Hungarians enjoy:  the most famous being gulys (goulash) a type of thick beef soup. The author links  the origins of  stuffed cabbage to ""sarma""  a type of  Turkish or Bulgarian dish made of spicey minced meat stuffed into grape leaves. He also explains ""tarhonya"" (dried pasta) has ancient origins dating back to nomadic tribes originating east of the Caucasian mountains. The brief description of food eaten during King Matthias Corvinus's era (1458 - 1490) is enjoyable: roast and grilled meat, food cooked in cauldrons, use of specific spices, gravies and the tidbit that turkeys were brought over from the Prince of Milan. The author compares Hungarian cooking styles and flavors with that of other countries. He describes a brief history of paprika, as well as the influence of French cooking, which was popular in Vienna during the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Consomms, fricass, and ragout dishes were added to the Hungarian meals.Some cooking methods strongly associated with the Hungarian kitchen are discussed such as using clarified or cooked lard which has been replaced with sunflower, canola or other oils in modern times. Other significant methods are: roux as a thickener made with a high gluten flour,  adding sour cream to specific dishes, and techniques such as ""prklt"" or braising of meat.  Hungarians add any of these spices: paprika, black pepper, dill, marjoram, savory, thyme, or green celery to sauces or a variety of dishes. It is the specific combination of cooking techniques and spices which creates the unique flavor identified as ""Hungarian cooking"" or ""cuisine"".Recipes are provided for these many different foods: soups, vegetables and their garnishes; vegetables; hot and cold entres; hot and cold fish dishes; meats including beef, veal, lamb, pork, game and winged game and poultry; salads;  and cakes, sweets, pastries. Famous Hungarian main meal recipes are described: goulash soup (gulys), fish soup (halsz leves). potatoe soup with sour cream (krumplis leves), bean soup with knuckle of ham, ; garnishes include vermicelli or diced pasta, semolina dumplings; famous sauces include paprika, mushroom, and horse-radish with vinegar. There are side dish recipes for fried potatoes and onions, paprikash potaoes, steamed cabbage, galushka (thimble dumplings0 with scrambled eggs,Hot entre recipes include: pancake stuffed with meat, Hortobgyi pancakes (very excellent!), paprikash mushrooms, and Hungarian omlettes. Fish main meals: Tihany Jack Salmon fillets, Cold Fogas (Pike Perch). Szeged Chowder (looks delicious!),  and Deviled Carp. There are famous main beef dish recipes such as, Peppered Tenderloin Stew (Tokny), Marhaprklt (Beef Paprika Stew), and Braised Rump of Beef. Veal dishes are: Veal Stew and Vegetables, Breast of Veal with Mushrooms and Rice,  Wiener Schnitzel and Veal in Paprika Sauce. Pork dishes included are: Pork Stew, Bcska (Serbian)  Meat with Rice, Stuffed Green Green Peppers, Szkely Stuffed Cabbage, and  basic Pork Cutlets. Desserts included are: various creams such as butter, walnut or chocolate cream; various cakes: chocolate, coffee, walnut and the well known Dobos Torta (Drum cake). Very well known recipes for a variety of biscuits, rolls and scones are given. And last but not least, there is the recipe for Rtes or Strudel which is a Hungarian favorite that includes delicious fillings, such as fried cabbage or cottage cheese or dessert strudels among which are sour cherries or apple strudel.

"This Remington three headed Rotary ladies shaver is easy to use and provides a very smooth shave. The head and cutter assembly region work in a coordinated fashion by adjusting to the curves of the body such as around and under knees and the underarm areas. The instructions are easy to follow, you must charge the  system for 24 hours before use. You then use the shaver as directed until another recharge is required which is indicated by the red low battery light. After first use, the recharge will take about four hours. Personally, I found this product to be one of the easiest and most satisfying shavers I have ever used. It did the job and did it very well.PROS: you buy the shaver once and can continually reuse it with minimal fuss as it has a recharge system, the product saves you money in the long term and it is environmentally safe as you do not keep buying razors that are thrown away. CONS: there are conscious steps which need to be taken for its use/reuse for optimal results (in other words, follow the directions closely for best results), you may need to concentrate on specific difficult to shave areas, such as around knees and beneath underarms with several attempts for successful results (not a deal breaker for me), you need to clean it properly after use (again not a deal breaker for me).For best performance, tips are provided on how to use the shaver. The shaver head needs to be rinsed thoroughly under water during and after shaving. It is recommended the shaver be used in the shower. First apply water to the area to be shaved, next apply shaving cream, rinse shaver under water and use short, circular strokes to area desired to be free of hair. Rinse the shaver head periodically to avoid build up of residue. Thoroughly rinse the shaver head of gel or shaving cream or foam. There are easy to follow printed instructions, complete with pictures which describe the proper technique of cleaning the shaver to maintain its performance. For smoothest results, instructions are given on stubborn or difficult to shave areas. Some of which are the following: ""hold the shaver at a right angle to the skin so the three heads are touching the skin with equal pressure"" (when this does not happen, often a few strands of hair are left  unshaved),  ""stretch the skin with the free hand so hairs stand upright, making it easier for them to enter the cutting chamber"" (this may be a deal breaker for impatient users who want instant results), ""use moderate to slow, circular movements  for a closer shave"", and ""do not press hard against the skin to avoid irritation and/or damage to the rotary heads.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVW3FNR4Y9DY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UF7FE4U#wasThisHelpful","ROVW3FNR4Y9DY","A2SRZQU1SZG4RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thomas Mallon has written a fascinating, insider's view of political life as it could have occurred.  The book begins with insights into the home life of Richard Nixon after his fall from glory as President of the United States. The author provides scenes, dialogue and dictated memos which eventually play an important role at a global meeting which could have outcomes no one can fathom. This book is a grand fictional novel which is interesting on so many levels. What is most impressive is how the author builds momentum and suspense as multiple players interact behind the scenes which lead to the world renown global  political meeting between President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik. The two super powers engage in secret negotiations on nuclear armaments and astonishingly there is an important controversial outsider whose knowledge informally attempts to influences the results or outcome. While the book is based on a serious subject it is written in a very amusing manner.The author excels at creating intrigue and total engagement, along with suspense and drama  at many political and government departmental levels as the plot and action move forward. The author provides realistic sounding dialogue, creates fictional events and interactions, and describes personal life circumstances of important historical figures, along with their spouses. The book is outstanding because it includes so many famous political figures who in the past had important positions of authority and power on the US political scene. Some of these persons in real life may not have been as important as they are portrayed by the author but the fictional portrayal within Washington political circles makes for great reading. Some of the characters are outstanding for very different reasons as the reader will discover when the story unfolds. Intrigue and twists within the plot arise from unexpected sources.The author's ability to convey the thoughts and feelings of important ""who's who"" important political figures in Washington politics from the mid 1970s up to and including the mid-1980s makes for a most amazing novel. There are occasional amusing anecdotes and connections, which balance out the novel and make it very interesting. The writing style of the author is such that the reader feels they get an understanding of the personality of the key figures. The book moves at a steady clip as the plot thickens. The book is filled with amusingly underhanded attempts at creating diversions while influencing outcomes during the world important summit meeting which takes place.

"Rose de Mai French milled soap is an exceptional product which is very fragrant and provides a silky smooth feeling to the skin when used. I was most impressed with the scent which was so evident in the package when it arrived! The fragrance is intoxicating and truly reminds you of a flower garden in the spring. The scent remained in the bubble envelope for quite a long time. When the soap is used, the fragrance permeates the bathroom and leaves a fresh spring feeling. This soap is perfect in a guest bathroom or for anyone who loves roses. It is an ideal soap to use to help relax and feel you are transported into another place and time where everything stands still.  The soap is made from vegetable products and of a perfect variety of rose blends. Also it is very reassuring to know there are no harsh chemicals such as parabens, alcohol, phenoxyethanol and DEA and best of all there is *no* animal testing.

"Jed Ringel is in his mid-fifties and a recently divorced businessman who has written a personal, revealing and at times intimate and humorous, tongue-in-cheek book about his search for romance using modern technology and the internet.  The book is a memoir of dating and starting life anew which is filled with both funny and serious stories of the author's experiences in the new environment of meeting people.  The book is fast moving and entertaining. He does not hesitate to poke fun at himself  or at some of the odd situations he encounters in his search for reconnecting with the opposite sex. His quest takes on an aura of adventure and travels into areas many would describe as ""a fool walks in where angels fear to tread"". It seems once he warmed up to the idea of meeting women and choosing them as if at a smorgasboard, the variety of choices became intoxicating. Of course, there is no guarantee the person he selects will agree to talk to him, or  that anyone meets his criteria for looks, personality, or other interests but that is a risk he is willing to take. For that matter, he may not match up to their criteria either!The author seems to plunge into unchartered waters of dating while still waiting for his divorce to come through. He joins a dating system called ""Dinner's on Me"" which caters to  men willing to pay $1,400 to have a meal with women selected by the agency who come closest to meeting the preferences/criteria the man chooses. The author describes several dinner dates with a wide variety of women, mostly foreign and each of a short duration. The author's first interesting story is about Cara, a mid-thirties attractive divorced woman, who seems to be looking strictly for a physical relationship which the author was initially only too happy to fulfill but after three months decides he could not in good faith continue, so he breaks it off.Eventually, Jed Ringel enters the internet dating scene by completing a profile on Match dot com. He makes few connections but then recognizes how to increase the odds of connecting with different women. Through trial and error, he discovers the etiquette of on-line communication and the incremental step by step method of establishing communication which has the possibility of meeting the true test of something resembling real life. The descriptions are often amusing and the learning experiences he shares are frequently  hilarious. I particularly enjoyed his antics and experiences in pursuing someone calling herself ""Funnybunny"". After a weekend of frantic back and forth emailing, the author felt he was on solid ground, especially when he was rewarded with her phone number. He left her a carefully worded message but after he got no response back, he felt rejected and was puzzled. Amazingly, after a bit of research on his part, he learned the real identity of  ""Funnybunny""  who was a well known costume designer involved in a controversial  well publicized mishap by a celebrity at a sporting event.What surprises me the most in this book is the author's enthusiasm, relentless pursuit, tenacity and faith in the on-line system of making real  life connections through different on-line dating methods. The most daring method the author uses to find romance is via a Russian website.  Against better judgement, Jed Ringel goes full throttle into this adventure. Sounds too good to be true? Right! To my astonishment, the author visited Russia to meet  Larisa, a 39 year old divorcee, who possessed two doctorates one in economics the other in political science and also an eight year old child. Fortunately, he realized their incompatibility and left the situation. One would expect, this to be a lesson learned, be grateful and stop (!) but not for this author! He made another attempt down the same road only the next Russian ingnue, astonishingly  had something very rare and unusual for a Russian: she possessed a green card. The reason is that the father of her son was an American. What should have raised red flags all over the place was that  she as still married to the American geologist. Of course, Jed Ringel goes full speed ahead and pays for Natalya and her son to come to the USA, who naturally live with him until he awakens to his folly! Natalya and her son ended up in Louisiana to reconcile with her husband.Another most fascinating escapade in this author's venturing forth to finding love involves a Chinese woman, Meihua who was born in mainland China and received her doctorate in chemistry at a university in the United States twenty years prior after which she landed a job at a major company. The author and she invest much personal time and energy into building first a friendship which is the solid foundation upon which a lasting relationship is build and then taking their relationship to the next level of physical intimacy, It seems Jed Ringel has at last found the right person after several years of active investigation and experimentation on his part. The reader of this review will have to read the book to learn if *this* was his lasting relationship - or not. Reviewer received a free copy of the book in exchange for the review. I found this book a most interesting reading experience. At times, I was horrified at the risks the author took in his pursuit of finding love but mostly I was entertained. Just a warning, the author does not hold back and uses some crude language in certain sections which may or may not be necessary.

"The title of this book and specifically this cover sentence', ""troubled dreamers meet at a remote island resort and discover they can run away from everything except themselves"" caught my attention and my imagination, enticing me to read this book. My imagination went into overtime and in multiple directions when considering what could be the contents of this book. Forunately the author's writing is far superior to my imagined stories and their outcomes. The book is written with both humor and seriousness. It considers the lives of several groups of very diverse and different people who likely would not otherwise meet and who are forced to socialize and learn about each other's lives. The location of the resort is an ""unnamed atoll [island] in the Tuamotu  Archipelago""  which means a Polynesian island located somewhere out in the South Pacific Ocean, which is very remote and removed from modern civilization. There is no internet and technology to interfere with your time and mind. You have sun, sand, a bungalow, hotel services, a restaurant and bar and various local specialized activities, such as scuba diving, fishing and sun bathing. Essentially, the visitors are isolated with their own thoughts and  personal behaviors. They are left to socialize with the other guests if they choose or to engage in their own interests. However, as human beings are social animals, eventually all guests have been introduced and socialize, breaking up into special interest groups and that is when all the real fun and seriousness of the novel takes off.What is truly amazing is how the author manages hold the reader in suspense and spell bound as she reveals the dynamics of very different personal relationships between various key couples lives. The author explores the hearts and minds of individuals and has them do self examinations about the decisions they made and their outcomes. What is most astonishing is how the author ties the novel together into a cohesive novel which includes a very satisfying conclusion to questions and issues of social justice, human rights, and global implications  and the impact of decisions made in the distant past, as well as concluding and resolving the personal problems which were the reasons the individuals and couples chose this resort in the first place.. The book becomes a magnificent human interest  story that examines areas of importance on a universal and yet still very personal level.The guests on the island are a married couple Ann, a successful lawyer and Richard, a highly talented chef whose marriage was rock solid until a business relationship and association rocked their finances and even threatened to break up their marriage. Another guest couple are unmarried but a hot item: an aging rock star named Dex Cooper and his twenty years younger mistress Wende. Another guest was a famous author, whose popularity was declining, and he was trying to reinvent his previous successful authorship and popularity. Loren, an aging French gentleman and former artist is the owner of the resort who came to the island for personal family reasons in the past, who was accepted by the native population not as an outsider but as part of the community and who later became the owner of the resort by winning it in a gambling bet. He has personal issues and demons with which he is wrestling due to his lifestyle which has caught up with him on a health issue, he has AIDS.; Furthermore, he is estranged from his only living daughter who is in France and with whom he has not spoken for many years. TIti is a native Polynesian who is both a housekeeper and cook for the resort. She is engaged to Cooked, a handsome young man of the islands who has secretly been engaging in activist issues which could get him into legal trouble with the French authorities. The author writes a highly engaging story in which she provides and reveals just the right amount of background information about the personalities and characters of key individuals and couples to create drama via a highly creative plot filled with tension and suspense. What is most surprising is the new cause around which the couples and individuals rally and support which becomes the unifying theme that resolves the book a highly satisfactory ending which can not be anticipated. I truly enjoyed this book.

"Cara Hoffman sensitively portrays the inner struggles of Lauren Clay, a young woman in her early twenties, who was honorably discharged after completing her tour of duty with the Army in Iraq. She returns to her hometown in New York state but deliberately does not tell anyone the exact day of her arrival. She returns a more private person who keeps her feelings tightly wrapped unlike before she went to Iraq.  She served her country well and chose to return to normal life, the word ""normal"" being a relative term. Nothing to Lauren felt like normal since getting home. She fights unfamiliar feelings of alienation and concerns for her safety which often arise. She makes every effort to remain controlled and keep her feelings hidden but unusual behaviors surface from time to time providing clues to those who pay close attention to her behavior, those who know her very well that all is not right. Everyone who knew Lauren before she entered the Army recognized her outstanding traits of leadership, responsibility and organization. No one was surprised she became a Sergeant and commander of a squadron. It was what they expected for her, it was who she was - only now she needed help, she did not recognize it, and everyone around her wanted to believe she was the same Lauren they knew before.Lauren's arrival to her hometown, she first visits Shane, her boyfriend from high school who was on break from college. His goal was to shake his small town roots, the speech and behavior patterns. They engaged in a physical love fest which help her become more grounded. It was the welcome home she craved after being away for so long. She knew she was different inside but did not know just how different until she later did a physical maneuver on him which surprised the both of them. Lauren attempts to reconnect with her best friend from high school on a similar basis of friendship to return to where they left off but it is difficult to do. Although they shared many experiences while growing up during high school, her friend had a child without benefit of marriage and was now raising Gracie with the help of her mom.  Lauren visits her voice coach and mentor, an organist at the local church who was not well recognized by many locals for his musical genius and talent. He saw Lauren from multiple perspectives and was trying to help her reconnect with her voice and musical talent. It is possible he saw through Lauren's defense mechanisms more clearly than her own family members.Lauren had given up pursuing her own personal goals to fulfill her role as she viewed it, to provide more money to the family. Her family consists of her father, a psychologist by profession but whose background as a former hippie seems to prevail in letting him neglect most of his fatherly duties to Lauren and her younger brother Danny, after his divorce. While still in high school, Lauren took on household duties, such as shopping for food, making meals and doing the laundry. Lauren joined the Army because  she wanted Danny to attend college without worrying about tuition. When in the Army, Lauren received delightful humorous emails from Danny who addressed her as ""sistopher"" while he pretended she was off on an exotic vacation in an exciting location. After many delaying tactics of avoiding her mother, Lauren at last had spoken with her by phone.  Her mom completed her degree, was teaching at a local college and had gotten her life together. After recalling good memories from the past, Lauren finally agreed to visit with Danny but not quite as discussed.What Lauren deliberately did not share her plan to *first* drive to Canada and from there back down to New York. She wanted to visit Darryl Green, a fellow Army recruit with whom she bonded under very adverse conditions. His deployment was also up and he planned to move his family to Canada where his wife's family lived. Lauren's goal was to introduce Danny to survival in the wild. She wanted him to become strong, to develop new skills and hone skills he did not even suspect he possessed. Lauren became obsessed with visiting the challenging northern climate of  Jeanne d'Arc basin, where an oil field existed. It is there that Lauren faced her personal demons and Danny essentially becomes her source of salvation but on the level she had anticipated.Cara Hoffman has written a very realistic, soul searching novel that explores an inner personal landscape in a very challenging manner. Furthermore, she selected to write about, a 21 year old female Non-Commissioned Officer in the US Army who served her tour in Iraq and was deployed back into civilian life, who faced personal challenges to living she could not imagine or fathom existed. The problems which she did not acknowledge or understand or admit erupted into a full blown life-threatening event, threatening the life of the very person she wanted to protect the most. This is a very well written book on a delicate subject which will hold the reader's attention from start to finish. It is a most excellent reading experience.

"I usually love books of short stories because most provide a glimpse into a different way of life, a new view or perspective on a life issue, or a surprise twist or unforeseen ending that leaves me thrilled and entertained or learning something new. I wish I could say all of the above for this book of twelve short stories but if I did, it would not be true.  For unknown reasons, the author focuses on people who have not discovered their true self , neither do they possess a solid foundation of beliefs and values upon which they can rely to build satisfying lives. The dissatisfaction in content of these stories could be due to a generational gap, perhaps because most of the stories are about generation Xers or millennials who seem to have lost their direction in life. They make decision mostly on emotion or haphazardly based on uncertain relationships or hoped for results which have little basis for actuality. I found the author's writing style like the staccato rhythm of a hammer driving a nail into wood at an uneven pace. The value system of some of the characters is shallow and usually lacking a solid foundation. Most of the characters seem to be floundering through life, without a core set life principles upon which they rely  There was sense of constant pounding of information, some of it rather interesting but the plot usually developed in a or direction that was not satisfying. There were few real surprises or unforeseen events which made it difficult to read some of stories to the end. Of course, as a reader, you plod through all the intensity and detail, hoping something will turn out for the better in the lives of the characters but in most of the stories it usually does not.To the author's credit, there is a lot of interesting detail to many of the stories, the stories have some direction, although the characters do not always reach their intended destination.  The characters are highly unique but we learn of their individuality by the odd decisions they make and the twisted maze into which their lives seem to fall. Sometimes the path they take on the maze of life seems to be without much effort on their part, they are thrown into events via association with friends from the past, and problems just seem to happen. The individuals do not accept the responsibility they had in making decisions nor do they realize that it is their lack of confronting issues which blow their lives fully off course into unexpected places.A brief introduction and synopsis without spoilers follows of the two stories I enjoyed. ""Sungold"" I found amusing because it started with the manager of a restaurant in South Florida wearing a mushroom suit outfit which is lent out to different franchises of the restaurant chain. The manager and the owner are good friends who trust each other and that is where the problems begin. The story and plot are very well developed. There is a fun plot, interesting characters whose interactions could take off in either of several directions. Most of the waitresses hired to work at the restaurant are predictably cute and near ""look a likes"" what the manager refers to as ""Mellissa/Jessicas"".  The author describes the owner Ethan as follows: ""Ethan is a self-sabotaging trust fund maniac whose folks set him up with this franchise for his thirtieth birthday, mostly , I think so he would have somewhere other than the grounds of the family estate - a former plantation, it could have gone without saying - to play 'In Memory of Elizabeth Reed' at blowout volume a dozen times a day. As long as he keeps his annual losses in the mid five figures they'll keep him in business. ..."" It is after the manager interviews and hires "" Appolinaira Pavlovna Sungold"", known as s ""Polina"",  who is quite a bit different than the usual Melissas/Jessicas,  that things get very interesting at the restaurant. They introduce new recipes on the menu and create a sensational trendy and popular restaurant with unexpected fringe benefits. This is one story which leaves the reader *wanting* to read more to see how the author resolves the unexpected twists and turns. The second outstanding story is called, ""Carole Alone."" It focuses on a retired couple who live in a beautiful new development in South Florida when unexpectedly her husband Gerald dies. Luckily,  Carol's son Dennis moved down with his family and live twenty minutes away. Although Carol has friends her own age, she feels adrift in life and engages in a potentially serious habit that could be fatal. One must read the story to learn what this maybe. I was captivated and truly enjoyed only these two stories out of the twelve. I felt luke warm to neutral toward eight stories and disliked two stories entirely.

"Joakim Zander has proven himself to belong to a very distinguished and exclusive class of top writers in the political and global suspense genre. He belongs alongside Tom Clancy, John LeCarr, and Graham Greene. The author creates a climate of suspense based on realistic sounding world events, competing and cooperative spy agencies, and innocent victims who are accidentally caught in the cross fire of cover ups, unscrupulous activities and murders. International politics, global trade, and lobbying for increased leverage are all part of the game to advance and influence world markets and global events.

Inadvertently, the secrets fell into the wrong hands and the risks of them leaking out increased greatly.

"This book is an artistic and literary achievement on many levels, most certainly foremost because of the writing style and talent of the author, Nancy Huston. She is able to build intrigue and interest based on several factors: first,  her introduction and development of complex subject matter; second,  the intertwining lives of two male filmmakers and third, her exploration and knowledge of different unique cultures which are woven into the fabric of the novel and which become the solid foundation upon which the lives of the characters are built and upon which the main plot and subplots rely. The complex flavors of these different cultures: Irish, French Canadian, German, Dutch, English, Brazilian and last but not least Indian, specifically Cree, are the matrix which constitute the personality and depth of life experiences from which Milo Noirlac's life stories in this book evolve. Milo Noirlac is a man in his fifties at the time the novel begins, as a final tribute to his life achievements, Paul Schwarz, his work and life partner collaborate on writing a screen play which essentially becomes his autobiography, both are award winning film makers. The connections made by the author from the past to the present and relationships between characters are written with a liquid fluidity and lyricism, the stories flow, despite the nonlinear technique of story telling.The reader is immediately drawn into the historical background of Neil Kerrigan, aka, Noirlac, Milo's grandfather who just finished law school and seems bent on losing his virginity in a brothel in Dublin. which happened about April 1910. Many years later, in Canada, Milo's mother, Awinita, happens to be a nineteen year old prostitute who works to provide money to her poor parents and family still living on the Cree Indian reservation. Milo's father is Declan, the seventh child of Neil Noirlac (changed his name from Kerrigan when he came to Canada). In Ireland, Neil was an Irish Catholic patriot and thus volunteered  in the Irish Republican Army, fighting the British rule. His brother Thom, was a student with James Joyce whose novel, ""The Dubliners"" was later published and won acclaim for depicting life as it really was lived by the poor Irish.  Right before Neil's eyes, Thom was shot by the British for his anti-British activities. Neil Kerrigan was advised by the poet, William Butler Yeats to leave Ireland and start a new life, preferably in Canada, where he could put his writing skills to good use.. Neil had been kicked out of his home by his father, a successful and well respected local magistrate because of Neil's involvement in rebellion and for being defrocked/debarred from practicing law. Neil sailed to Canada and met his French Canadian wife there.  He became the father of twelve children and worked in the lumber business, all the while reading good literature and collecting books, some of them first editions by famous authors. Declan, a seldom working and alcohol loving son of Neil Noirlac, fathered Milo and despite his undependable ways, remained loyal to Awinita, Milo's mother. Milo was given up for adoption, soon after his birth and lived in at least five foster families before being rescued by his grandfather Neil and brought to live with the family. Milo suffered some abuse at the foster homes, and when Declan learned of his son's fate, he often intervened, taking him out of them and had him placed in what he hoped was a better family environment. Eventually, when Neil learned he had a grandson, he took him to their own home. Milo's grandmother died in childbirth with her thirteenth offspring. The female head of the household was Maria-Thrse, his aunt on his mother's side. Needless, to say Milo had a very complicated and dysfunctional upbringing. Despite, the twists and turns of fate, Milo survived and became successful on his own terms. Some of the subject matter in this book sounds somewhat weird but the author manages to create a fascinating and engaging novel filled with unexpected surprises that keep the reader hooked and wanting to learn more about Milo Noirlac's life.Nancy Huston has received world wide attention with several of her novels: Fault Lines, Plainsong, Slow Emergencies and The Mark of an Angel. These four novels have received highly prestigious literary awards in France. The French love existentialism, art, literature, and good food and wine. Black Dance has received high praise from ""Elle"" magazine and from ""Madame Figaro"" and will just possibly be another award winning book in France. It definitely has the hallmarks of fine writing with a strong plot and unforgettable characters, along with contemporary subject matter.

"This KitchenAid Nespresso coffee machine is for coffee lovers and it will make six strengths of *your* *choice* of specialty coffee to perfection. You can create your favorite specialized brew to one of six settings: 1) 25 ml/ 0.8 oz, (ristretto, which is super strong, 2) 40 ml/1.35 oz (espresso which is very strong, 3) 60ml/2 oz (still quite strong), 4) 90 ml (less strong but highly noticeable), 5) 110 ml/ 3.7 oz (strong enough for but frothy and tasty, better than American style), and 6) 130 ml/ 4.4 oz (closer to American style but noticeable coffee taste). There are 22 coffee capsules available for purchase from Nespresso on-line, other on-line stores, or you might find them at a local store near you. You receive a sample pack of 16 coffee capsules with the machine purchase and a ""Coffee Menu"" booklet which describes each one by intensity, country of origin, and gives guidelines of how to brew, that is which brewing volume provides the best flavor for that selection.  One thing I learned in this booklet is ""a coffee's intensity is not dependent on its caffeine level."" ""The coffee's intensity is defined by its ""degree of roasting, its body and its bitterness."" ""Intensity is the level of concentration of the coffee, not the amount of caffeine it contains."" The instructions on use are easy to follow and I made five cups of coffee in two days before I ran into a major problem which is described in paragraph three of this review.There are two highly important booklets which *must* be read before using your machine.  The first is aptly titled ""my machine"" which is the instruction manual. It explains the most important features of your machine, complete with a diagram, has safety tips and safeguards, and mandatory steps to be followed for use. One thing which should be emphasized in the booklet is that before brewing coffee for the first time, it is necessary to run water through the machine three times on the ""lungo"" setting. There are necessary explanations about preheating, brewing the coffee, how to change the setting during mid-brew, how to empty the machine of used coffee capsules,  how to place the machine on automatic stand-by for longer than manufacturer setting of 9 minutes and the all important cleaning and care instructions. The  second booklet is a quick use guide to brewing coffee, titled ""Get Brewing"". This one important sentence in this booklet is very easy to miss: ""To prepare the Espresso Machine for brewing, refer to your ""Instructions"" manual."" It needs to be capitalized and highlighted in a different color, with these additional words: ""it is necessary to run water through the machine three times"" see page 10 of booklet ""my machine"".I ran into a major problem making my sixth cup of coffee: I got no coffee. After following directions as usual, no coffee came out after the flashing light stopped. I pressed the *brew* button again, no coffee. Also I noted, no water was missing from the water container. I tried ejecting the capsule, I could not lift the handle which closes the capsule compartment. After five or six attempts at making the coffee, I realized I had a major problem on my hands. I waited about 30 minutes and tried brewing the coffee again several times, same problems! I turned off the machine, reread everything in the operating manual, I reassured myself I followed the steps for brewing coffee correctly.  looked inside the capsule compartment, confirmed the coffee capsule had dropped down. Nothing was visible. I hoped I could simply remove it and then try another capsule expecting the machine would function properly, no such luck. I held the machine tightly (it is rather heavy) and shook it a bit, hoping to dislodge the coffee capsule and eject it. Nothing helped. I called the 1-800 telephone number for Nespresso on Memorial Day, where a nice person decided the problem needed to be reported to KitchenAid. There is a two year replacement warranty on this product. The next day, I called the toll free ""Customer eXperience Center"" for KitchenAid. I explained my problems, she quickly apologized, took down pertinent information and agreed to have a replacement machine sent free of charge as there is two year warranty. She reviewed the steps I need to follow to return the defective machine as per warranty after I receive the replacement model. All of it is at no charge to the customer, using FedEx for delivery and pick up. I have been reassured this is a rare problem. Everyone I encountered regarding this problem was pleasant, professional and moved into action to resolve this unfortunate incident. I love the coffee machine and realize with all of its complicated mechanical, computerized and technical parts, something could go wrong. Addendum June 25, 2015:  For the record, I received the replacement in three days. I returned the defective model in the same carton as instructed via FedEx prepaid by the warranty. I have used the new machine for a month without difficulties.

"This book will help readers decide where to make necessary changes in their lives when they experience work / personal life conflicts. When these two areas in ones life clash or compete it results in emotional upheavals.  A  person feels miserable and dissatisfied. The author points out the cause, which is usually believing  the myth that one can have it all.  The author contends no amount of effort will achieve  this kind of balance.  Deidre  Maloney unequivocally states, it is possible to be happy and satisfied with ones life  but that one must choose  very carefully what is most important to you which is defined as having *your* all.. This book focuses on the comparison and contrasts between ones work and personal life and the authors study of people who have achieved what she calls a blissful life and some who have not.  Choosing wisely is key. Choices are highly individualized and unique to each person. The point is everyone can enjoy the journey called life. This does not mean there will be no problems, it means the good will outweigh the bad and life will be more fulfilling, satisfying and real.The book is written in a chatty, informative manner and not difficult to read. It is well organized into main topics, subtopics and detailed information with conclusions. The author has certainly done her homework on this important subject. She offers some sage suggestions and guidelines to living a more fulfilled and happy life.  While it is not clear what credentials the author possesses in terms of education and background, her book is a thorough discussion  of the subject. She explains her focus, the criteria she used and her approach.The topic of finding your bliss sounds trite and New Agey but this book is anything but that. The topic is treated in a forthright manner but not so seriously that it puts the reader off.  There is no magic formula or step by step approach that works for everyone but  this book will guide  the reader to determine *if* they need to change, it will help them set goals which are achievable. The author uses an interesting  phrase  life is a messy stew.  When she encountered  personal struggles to achieve work/life balance, she felt anxious, was unhappy and was becoming distant from her husband. She chose to examine and study the lives of the blissful people she knew and write this book about what she learned.  While they did not have it all, they were selective in their choices of what was important to them, how they used their energy, effort and time. They defined what was important using their own criteria which is not always how society defined it.This is a descriptive book based on qualitative questions designed by the author. It takes the approach of a study but it is *not* scientifically based because it does not use statistics or validated questionnaires/ tools. The author selected/identified the people for her study based on the characteristics she recognized they possessed: happy, fulfilled and satisfied  lives.  She also selected a few from the other side, unhappy ones, those who were not blissful, who  talked a lot about being overworked and overtired.  What conclusions did the author reach? The blissful group identified the following important values as the basis of their choices: their job was the right fit, they avoided/ would not work for  the bad boss, they made their decisions solely on what was right for themselves regarding the importance of salary, title and personal satisfaction. In their personal lives, they chose their partner based on the right fit which meant unique/individual characteristics/traits, understanding each others roles, choosing priorities together, recognizing and expressing respect, and keeping gratitude as a top priority. The author also discusses these areas: the blissful family, relationships with the others, and ones personal network. The concept of accountability cop as described makes a lot of sense. The issue  called  sticky family dynamic is touched upon with some important high lights but it is not given a thorough analysis. I really do not blame the author, it is very complex area and deserves to be the subject of another book. One section which stood out for me and was particularly well developed was titled Those Sneaky Bliss Busters.  It included the following chapters, The Blissful You, The Blissful Plan , Embracing  the Big C [change], Getting a Hold of that Brain of Yours, Tackling Your Money Issues and  The Science of Bliss.Overall, the author has achieved her objective in writing a most interesting and helpful book. It will be a great resource and guide for anyone to make changes in their life, if they find the ideas and concepts leading to problems apply, as discussed in this book.  The book really makes you think about what is important in life and to examine your choices through the lens of this authors perspective.  This reviewer received a free copy of the book in exchange for this honest review.

"This book seems small in total number of pages but it is jam packed, full of valuable information for the motivated person who wants to be successful, productive, influential and rise in status in their job, regardless of the current position they hold within the company. What makes this book so fascinating and outstanding is the promise on the cover and within the title: ""unleashing the crucial leadership skills you already have.""  The introduction gets immediately to the heart of the matter: most people want to know the secret of great leadership which the authors point out: depends. What does it depend on? The answer seems so obvious: the skills you already possess and most importantly on the skills you have partially developed, what they refer to as ""hidden strengths"" or those within the middle.The book is written in a matter of fact,  clear, precise and to the point style. It is well organized and does not waste words or time. The authors  let you know up front where most people go wrong, which is by trying to improve their areas of weaknesses and turn them into strengths. Great leadership occurs because of several factors: the skills you already possess, your environment and the goals you are working to achieve. There is no magic formula: it is all about individual learning, improving the hidden strengths meaning those already  partially developed. It is imperative to have a plan, identify one's motivation, set goals, choose two or three hidden strengths to change into learned strengths and lastly to evaluate one's progress.If your goal is to grow and succeed then this book is the key. The authors describe four categories of skills: leading self, leading others, leading the organization and leading implementation. Within each category are seven specific skills that leaders who are successful have developed and use. For example under ""leading self""  the specific identified skills are"" emotional control, flexibility, integrity, self-confidence, executive presence, and work/life balance. Under ""leading others"" some examples of skill requirements are: assertiveness, conflict resolution, verbal communication, and team work and collaboration. For the category ""leading organization"" some of the necessary skills are creativity and innovation, inspirational vision, organizational vision and strategic thinking. In the fourth category ""leading implementation,""  the following are a few required skills: coaching and mentoring, customer focus, delegation, effectiveness and thoroughness.There is an on-line hidden strengths assessment tool which needs to be completed to identify which specific skills are your strengths, which are partially developed hidden strengths and which are considered weaknesses. It is best to work on only two or three hidden strengths. The authors advise using resources and help that is easily available to you, such as your manager  or someone you can trust as a mentor within the work place, the human resource department which may offer classes on areas you are working to improve, plus they suggest doing your own research to find books, magazine articles, classes or seminars on your identified hidden strengths. Next it is imperative to practice these new skills at meetings, one-on-one, writing proposals or wherever interactions in the workplace present opportunities. Getting feedback on one's progress can be a little tricky but the authors discuss ways for an individual to measure the progress made toward achieving identified goals. The reviewer received a free copy of the book in exchange for this honest review Overall, this is a  very excellent guide to achieving the goal of developing partially hidden strengths and learning to make them stronger toward on the job success.

"Joseph Finder has written one of those fast-paced, easy-to-read but difficult-to-put-down suspense filled novels which grabs you on page one and does not let go until the very last page. The story grabs the reader from the first page which has an ad for a Queen Anne style home for sale  located on a large, well proportioned lot with many mature trees plus many other fine features but ends with the words ""in need of updating"". Rick Hoffman, the narrator adds his unique insights and ideas about the ad and reveals significant details about his lifestyle in a casually humorous and deprecating manner. Needless to say, Rick's income and lifestyle have taken a turn for the worse. A neighbor, and old high school friend,  was a builder. He offered to do some renovations on the house and accept his payment after the sales, with the expectation the house would be worth around 2 million dollars, as others had already sold for 1.5 million after repairs. Rick agreed and asked a contract be drawn up. However,  it is after some walls were demolished and Rick saw large groups of packages which turned out to be  one hundred dollar bills and some of fifties that the story picks up momentum and develops new trajectories. This unexpected discovery is the immediate hook which captures the reader who anticipates a rocky, twisted and winding but fascinating story ahead. No reader will be disappointed with this novel. It has a fast moving, well developed plot that takes the reader into the complex web and underbelly of Boston city business and politics. It provides insights as to how the city used to function (and who knows perhaps on some levels it still does.)Rick realizes that he has discovered a huge amount of cash, in fact 3.4 million dollars and it could only mean one thing: illegal pay offs. He realizes he is in great danger. He is no longer broke but his greatest concern is to discover its source. He hides the money in a storage facility and his quest now becomes to unravel the mystery of its origins. Rick's father, Leonard Hoffman, was a well known lawyer who suffered a stroke about 18 years ago, so asking him would not get any answers.  Rick is suspicious that his father was involved in some nefarious business deals and for which he received cash pay offs. Yet Rick was not convinced that his father could or would do anything illegal, knowing his character and the fact he was a well respected, highly regarded member of the community, He rummaged through some of his dad's old papers and files for leads and clues for the direction of his search. The mystery and suspense in this novel builds with each clue and the action gets more intense. Rick Hoffman is learning much more than he ever could have guessed about the types of businesses his dad represented and the complex deals which were made in the city of Boston 18 - 20 years ago. By pure chance Rick also meets Andrea Messina, a former high school girlfriend with whom he broke up right before entering college. She is much better looking than he remembered and had quit her job at Goldman Sachs to start her own business. It is a nonprofit school called Geometry Partners which helps lower income kids to learn and enjoy math. Rebuilding a friendship and eventual romance with Andrea becomes a priority for Rick along with uncovering the mysterious origins of the money he found.On this quest for the truth, Rick is assaulted, abducted and beaten up to the point of requiring hospitalization. He suffered  a concussion and several fractures. Rick wants to determine the identity of ""P"",  who turned up often in  a datebook kept by his dad and who had an appointment within days before his father's stroke. He wants to find him and  speak with him if possible. To this end, he meets with Monica Kennedy, a star investigative reporter for the Boston Globe, the newspaper for which  Rick had worked before becoming greedy and taking the executive position with the social magazine. An article written by Monica seemed to have much  promise of revealing a Boston scandal of major proportions but instead it became a human interest story. However, it had some intriguing loose ends which had not been investigated therefore Rick did some private interviews and investigations of his own. Following the loose ends and shady areas associated with the article, Rick not only learned the origins of the millions of dollars of hidden cash, he also  learned who his dad , Len Hoffman *really* was as person, in terms of ethics, values and moral character.  The discoveries Rick made about his  dad's character and values  were much more important to him than finding the money.

"Paula McClain has written an epic novel about the life of Beryl Markham which captures the excitement, drama, romance and promise of great opportunities for success (or failure) in a new land which was raw, natural, and undeveloped. It is about life in Kenya in the 1920s which the British were colonizing and is a fictionalized story based on a real person, Beryl Markham. The author incorporates some  stories from Beryl Markham's autobiography, West with the Night, but most of it is fiction. This  novel is filled with charismatic, larger than life personalities, whose strengths and flaws (sometimes obvious other times well hidden) are carefully revealed in a novel filled with adventure, romance and unexpected conflicts and problems, some are resolved, others not. Beryl had married twice, each marriage failed for very different reasons. Each of her marriages occurs within different circumstances, the context of which promises Beryl very different lifestyles and very different conflicts and problems follow. Beryl's life story makes for excellent reading, first because of the exotic location and era but mostly because of the talented writing style, prose and unforgettable moments described by the author. Two failed marriages and one grand but surprising love affair, which is really a love triangle that includes a good female friend, whom Beryl liked and admired, should be enough enticing information about the plot.The real Beryl Markham broke from the conventional role for women at a time when this was unheard of. Perhaps it is more accurate to say, due to her early upbringing which had few restrictions and unbridled freedom, she was never molded into any conventional female role to begin with. She lacked a female role model because her mother could not get used to the hardy lifestyle expected of women in Kenya nor did she appreciate the wilderness or its seclusion and isolation especially from  society. She returned to England with her son, who had frail health, leaving five year old daughter Beryl to be raised by her father. Beryl had natural abilities related to handling horses that she inherited from her father and she also possessed an innate courage which she applied to becoming the first licensed female race horse handler and trainer in Kenya and later was the first female pilot to be granted a professional B license (both actual events in real life), Notably, the real Beryl Markham had the remarkable achievement in 1936 of flying across the Atlantic Ocean, in twenty one hours, which was a record-breaking event at the time. She had received a huge reception in New York where 5,000 people gathered to welcome her but no such reception in her England awaited her. During much of her real life, scandal and gossip plagued her and it is upon this which the author, Paula McClain builds a highly engaging, fascinating, and well written fictionalized story of Beryl's  complex nature.

"Deborah J. Cornwall takes a difficult and sensitive subject and conveys much needed information in a clear, concise, compassionate manner. This is a fine resource for helping families to cope. It is a great guide to help them live through this highly threatening disease, its treatment and the emotional impact on all members of the family. The author deals with complex issues, such as the initial diagnosis, the impact on one's personal life both within the family structure as well as with friends and school, the possibility of a failed outcome which means the possibility of death, the need for strong pain management and its unintended consequences, side effects. The story which stood out most for me was where the daughter-in-law cared for her husband's father at home while he was dying and how she coached her two children ages eight and five, through helping their grandfather die with dignity. A hospice worker helped the children create a memory box and special windmill. The children placed Grandpa's pillow case into a plastic bag to keep his memory alive and fight over who gets to sleep with Grandpa.The chapters are well organized and clearly written. The author breaks down the chapters as follows: Chapter One: Sharing the News, Chapter Two: Managing Cancer's Impact for Children, Chapter Three: When the Child is the Patient, Chapter Four: When Children Lose a Parent or Sibling to Cancer, and Chapter Five: Other Resources for Caregivers About Children.  In the Preface, the author shares an acronym CHIN which stands for C- Control, H- Hope, I- Isolation, and N- Normalcy. The CHIN concepts are incorporated throughout the book to bring better understanding and management of dealing with the difficulties which arise with a cancer diagnosis.One helpful feature in this book is that the main concepts or principles are boldly printed at the beginning of each chapter. The author then  describes each concept and provides real life examples of interviews with families and children, which are printed in italics making it easy to read and differentiate from the author's own writing. For example in Chapter One - Sharing the News, the author placed six principles in bold print: Be Proactive, Tap Expert's Best Guidance, Consult with the Professional Care Team, Meet the Child's Needs Not Your Own, Level With and Engage Older Children, and Be Direct.  Each principle is given a thorough explanation in a clear precise manner. The  author also lists resource books and websites which support the principles she discusses. This book does an excellent job in helping those affected to cope and manage the complicated issues, emotions and behaviors which may be experienced by the caregiver, communicator or the children involved. The reviewer received a free copy of this book in exchange for this honest review.Anyone interested in this subject is also recommended to view the documentary ""A Lion in the House"" which shows a six year journey of living with different cancer diagnoses by five extraordinary young people. The film looks at the children within the context of family, the hospital and their individualized treatment and how everyone affected by the disease copes. It shows meetings with doctors, coping with insurance coverage, nurses providing treatments, the difficulty of making decisions related to care and treatment. It is a heart wrenching film but highly inspiring and hopeful as well.

"Lonely Planet has created an innovative, colorful and most important of all, a handy, easy to use and very helpful guide to explore the exciting, bustling Asian city: Tokyo. This very useful guide offers many possibilities for experiencing one-of-a-kind, individualized memorable adventures based on personal interests.  A wide range of opportunities are described on small activity cards, in fact there are descriptions of twelve opportunities or activities on each card, that is twelve cards each for morning, afternoon and evening, which allows for many unique experiences. Easy to read maps are included for the visitor to mix and match activities based on region visited or on areas of interest such as, art or historical museums, cultural or historical landmarks, imperial gardens, famous shopping districts and best viewpoints from observation towers in famous high rise buildings. The mass transit system (subway) is described which allows the visitor to navigate and travel from one location to another in rapid time. One very large city map is included which will make locating places of interest and ability to determine distance and time for travel much better.There are uniquely Japanese experiences available such as, Sumo wrestling matches or visit the neighborhoods where they live and train, Shinto shrines, open air markets, famous seafood markets, kabuki theater, vintage neighborhoods, historic geisha quarters, modern shopping districts and the well known East Shinjuku nightlife. The authors provide information about restaurants on each suggested activity card, with a mini-map and instructions for transportation on how to get there. The ""getting around"" section is very helpful describing the subway system, discount transportation cards and the best means to get to and from the closest airport. Included in the guide are useful tips for shopping for oneself, others and for children. Some assistance is given about the currency, and usual hours of service for museums, restaurants, and bars. Websites are given for Lonely Planet, Tokyo Tourism, and Metropolis which lists arts and entertainment activities. Some useful tips are given for ""dos and don'ts when eating and drinking"" and an important aspect of bathing which is a ritual in Japan, of interest is that people with tattoos may be refused admittance at some bathhouses. The only thing missing in this travel guide is a listing of hotels which for most people should not be a problem as anyone these days can research their choice of hotels and prices and make arrangements on the internet.

"The title of this book of short stories speaks volumes about the content. Who can resist mayhem in New York City especially if it occurs in Manhattan? The slim volume I received is a sample of four short stories which will be included in the *final* published book that will consist of seventeen or eighteen stories, depending on which information I read is correct. The cover of my ""advanced reading sample from uncorrected proofs"" names 6 authors and then has this added ""and 12 others"" which equals 18. The table of contents lists 17 titles of short stories. Whichever is correct, if the four stories I read are any indication of the rest of this book, I can predict, the reader will be sorry if there are only seventeen! The four I read are spell binding, highly engaging, complex stories filled with unforgettable characters that have great depth and well developed personalities. There are suspense-filled plots with twists and turns which lead down paths to places, feelings, situations, and events the reader can not anticipate which make the stories all the more appealing and memorable. There are magnificent black and white photos of New York which enhance the appeal of these stories, presenting the city as a magical mysterious landscape.The first story, ""Three Little Words"" written by Nancy Pickard engages the reader's emotions from the start, Priscilla, an attractive young woman in her mid-twenties is told by her doctor she has only a few weeks to live. She and her doctor engage in ""gallows humor"" and he advises she make a ""bucket list"" of things to do to make whatever time she has to live, worthwhile. She gets note paper from him and writes these words ""tell the truth"". They decide she should check in with him every day which she does for three days and he does not hear from her the fourth day. It turns out for a good reason, she was murdered on a street near her home where she usually jogged, only her energy lately only permitted her a fast walk, if that. Dr. Sam Waterman decides to attend her funeral, despite the fact she was a patient. The funeral was highly unusual to say the least. Her family, the Windsors: parents, sister and her boyfriend all sat together, stoically without shedding a tear or looking mournful. Just at the close of the service, someone stands up and choses to describe one of Priscilla's last meetings with him. It brought smiles and tears to many attendees faces. It turns out he was offered $5,000 by Priscilla for engaging customers in a different manner than his usual during his business day. A taxi driver told another humorous but heart warming story of his encounter with Priscilla. Dr. Waterman learns some personal matters about Priscilla from her god-mother who took care of her during her teenage years and whose husband bequeathed her $ 3 million dollars. The detective who was investigating her murder shows the doctor a list of items, 6 of which are crossed off and the last one, the word ""Dustin"" is not. The doctor recognizes it as Priscilla's ""bucket list"" but denies knowing what the word ""Dustin"" refers to. However, as the story unfolds more details are revealed about Priscilla's secret past, the *real* reasons for her the broken relationship with her parents and sister become evident. Even more surprising is the greatest revelation of all: the link between the word ""Dustin"" and Dr. Waterman.The other three stories in my sample volume are just as fascinating and enjoyable. The second story ""Chin Yong Yun Makes a Shidduch"" author S.J. Rosen is about a Chinese mother, who partakes in a private matter associated with the kidnapping of a young Chinese woman, Valerie Lim. She is the girlfriend of her son, Tien Hua, whose American name is Tim. He is her very successful son who is unmarried and a lawyer. Valerie's mother asks Tim to deliver the ransom money to the kidnapper. Tim asks his mother to notify his sister, Ling Wan-Ju, known as Lydia, who is a private investigator. Tim tried unsuccessfully to reach Lydia and knows his mother is more likely than anyone to get hold of her very fast. He specifically admonishes his mother make sure the police are not notified which is at the request of Mrs. Lim. The kidnapper asked for a ransom of $200,000 dollars and the great fear is he might murder Valerie if his demands are not all met. The story is told from the perspective of Mrs. Hua, a widow, who is the loving mother of five successful Chinese adult children. She also interferes in the personal lives of her children, which often by American standards would be annoying to say the least. It turns out, rather than notify Lydia,  Mrs. Hua does some investigating of her own and uncovers fine details which actually lead to the identity of the kidnapper who is apprehended by the police. In her well meaning and loving manner( from her viewpoint) she resolves another thorny issue in Tim's life and it is yet to be determined how this latest intervention will be viewed by Tim or if it brings about the hoped for results.The third story, ""Trapped"" written by Ben H. Winters is really about a ""play within a play"" on multiple levels. There is an investigation of the murder of Mr. Otto Klein,who is the producer of a play titled ""Deathtrap."". All the actors and actresses are suspects. The questioning by the investigator, the innuendos, the accusations, the assumptions of ""who dunnit"" are superbly written and very humorous. The twists and turns of the different people who become suspects and their presumed motive for the deed are enormously funny to read. Even more amusing is the ending which is the ultimate twist in the plot or perhaps more accurately the turn of the screw,  which no reader could possibly predict.The fourth story, ""The Day After Victory"" written by Brendan Dubois provides new insights into how victory is defined and experienced by different people. Needless to say, justice is done. I highly recommend this book of short stories and look forward to the 13 or 14 other stories which are to be published in the final version of the book.

"Mia Alvar has written realistic, in depth, thought provoking sensitive and eye opening short stores that provide the reader insights into multiple levels of society, usually of expatriates from the Philippines who emigrated or work abroad, to earn a better living. The stories describe their everyday lives, their joys, sorrows, aspirations, struggles, and successes.

"When faith and hope in God are combined with reality, the outcome can result in miracles and that is what this book is about, in fact, it is about four miraculous births and their survival against many odds. When the life of the author's pregnant daughter, Anne was threatened due to serious respiratory distress and failing kidneys, the difficult decision was made to do a Caesarian section surgery to deliver her four highly premature babies, at the age of twenty four weeks and a few days. The reality is the early birth and survival of these premies with the help of  modern medical knowledge and advancements in technology combined with highly skilled professionals, including neonatologists, NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) Registered Nurses, and Respiratory Therapists plus many others. These dedicated professionals kept vigil and applied all their caring, skills and knowledge to save the lives of these ""born before their time"" babies, all of whom lived through many challenging events after they came into this world. The surgery brought them out of the womb which was supposed to be their home for proper nourishment, development and maturation for several more months. In this highly personal and dramatic book, Timothy Spillane recounts the difficult decisions, emotional upheavals and many harrowing struggles which occurred after the entry of these very special children into the lives of the Schlender family (Anne, a Dermatologist and Captain in the Army and her husband Robert, an engineer), plus maternal grandparents, Timothy and Donna, Aunts, Erin and Caitlin plus the Schlender grandparents, Gene and Julie.Many stories stand out as particularly well written and outstanding, all of them are about the life-threatening events faced by various babies at their early point of development.  Wyatt Lee one of the premature boys was transferred to a NICU in Christus Santa Rosa where a neurosurgeon placed a ventriculo-peritoneal (V-P) shunt into his brain to deal with his hydrocephalus, a condition not uncomomon among very premature infants. The other very harrowing event to be resolved was the Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), an opening in the heart between the aorta and the pulmonary artery which was a problem for three of the babies, Timmy, Edda and Wyatt. The recommended treatment was intravenous indomethacin, which had some risks but was the first treatment of choice before surgery. While the IV Indomethacin worked for Wyatt, for Timmy it caused a perforation in his bowel which required two drains be placed on the right and left side of his abdomen, to prevent infection, while the tear healed itself. Unfortunately, Timmy developed other complications, where his heart rate rose and blood pressure dropped, a life threatening condition which required an intravenous vasopressor drug, luckily it stabilized his blood pressure. Timmy was transferred to Christus Santa Rosa Hospital temporarily for surgery to close his PDA. Unfortunately, during this surgery, the left side of Timmy's vocal cord was damaged which affected his voice and ability to cry outloud. All the babies had screenings for Retinopathy of Prematurity, three of them needed laser surgery to prevent the abnormal growth of blood vessels in their eyes, only Timmy's eyes were mature enough to not require this intervention. The author does a great job in describing events which eventually led to the discharge home of all four babies and the challenges they faced in development as they grew into becoming toddlers. Especially gratifying are the photographs which allow the reader to view these premature quadruplets during different stages of their lives.Timothy Spillane possesses a rare gift for writing, which gives the reader the sense of being in the midst of the action and events, all the while experiencing the feelings and thoughts associated with the difficulties and triumphs of helping four prematurely born babies to survive. Throughout, the author provides the reader occasional stories about his daughter Anne and her sisters while growing up. We learn about how Anne met her husband, Rob and their decision to have children plus some of their concerns, especially fascinating was Rob's prescient thoughts about this monumental life change. The author shares with us his own story as a new parent when in his mid twenties, he and his wife became parents to identical twins, Anne and Erin who were also born prematurely but by no means as early as Anne's quadruplets The author concludes the book with wonderful descriptions of the milestones achieved by these special children, and how they beat the odds and continue to live purposeful, happy lives bringing joy and fulfillment to their family. In summary, the author's honesty and  great attention to detail, personal and emotional, along with his accuracy in describing medical conditions and ethical dilemmas that arose while the four premature babies hovered between life and death places this book in a category by itself, far above many other memoirs. The reviewer received a free copy of the book for writing this honest review.

"This is the correct replacement battery for my Aspire One D255E-13639 model and I recommend  this seller and product to anyone who needs a replacement battery. After four years, my original battery wore out. I did a search on amazon and asked a few questions. I received very helpful responses both from the seller as well as customers who bought this item. The best advice was to look at the battery model which was on  a sticker on the computer itself.  It was very reassuring to see my battery model listed on this site so I ordered the product. It was also very reassuring to read the satisfied customers and their reviews here.I replaced the battery in my computer without difficulty but it took a few tries because this battery is somewhat larger than the original one which is no surprise as several reviewers have mentioned this.  I discovered how to slide it in using the grooves and click it in place, an easy process. The larger size is not a problem because it provides a better tilt to using the keyboard and also for viewing the screen.Best of all: this product has more battery power (6 cells) and provides about 5 - 5.5 hours of use than the original which gave only 1.5 - 2 hours of battery use (3 cell battery).  The instruction booklet recommends letting the battery go down to 2% *before* recharging it for the first time to 100%. It also recommends keeping it charged to at least 70% for best use.

"In Volume IV of this highly inspiring series Robert Chomany reflects on the important concepts of Confidence, Doubt, Success, Patience, Rest and Gratitude. Bawb provides a general introduction before each topic which makes the reader understand and realize how living and expressing the concept makes one experience a  more satisfying and fulfilling life. The author provides encouraging, inspirational poetry in an easy to follow, flowing style that is crystal clear in its expression of truth. The following are two examples of the simple expressions which are rich in meaning: ""A shadow of doubt is simply that: a place where light does not shine. Just by being confident you can make that space divine"" (p. 24). Another gem"" Life won't always be what you expect, in fact sometimes it's a chore; to give success a chance to knock, you may have to build your own door."" (p. 47) Another expression of simple truth: ""Don't rush through your life, take time to enjoy it. we all have calm balance once we take time to employ it."" While the statements themselves sound simple, living and expressing them in everyday life takes a enlightened awareness and remembrance of what is important right at that moment which is spiritual reality and being true to oneself.

"With a great deal of candor and humor Mireya Navarro recounts her captivating, engaging, and occasionally tug-of-war relationship with Eddie, her husband's dog. The dog came into her husband's life four months before Mireya and as such he laid claim to him as master and best friend. He often treated the author as a rival and competitor for her husband's affections, friendship and even territory, as in their bedroom. The dog was a mixed breed, a mutt that had the appearance of an Australian cattle dog, called a blue heeler, When he was taken out for walks, he was admired for his distinctive fur and coloring which consisted of many dark spots of different sizes on white fur. The author had me hooked right from the start with this sentence: "" I underestimated the dog.""  His personality toward the author remained tolerant but at times became passive-aggressive. The expressions of his behaviors as described in the book are superbly told in three locations. Their relationship began in Los Angeles where Jim, her husband and she lived for about five years after they got married. Next. their jobs required a move to New York to which Eddie adjusted rather well given his proclivities and eccentricities.  It is in Montclair, New Jersey, where the author and her husband bought a house, within relatively easy commute to their jobs in New York that Eddie begins showing acceptance and even affection toward the author. Unfortunately, by this time Eddie is in his declining years and this makes for a poignant and yet very sad but satisfying ending to his life story.Eddie's life is a wonderful story but the fact that it is told within the context of two cultures, the author's which is Puerto Rican and her husband's which is Jewish, adds even more spice to an already promising tale (no pun intended). The story is also told within the context of a second marriage for Jim, her husband, who has two preteen children, a girl and boy who spend half the week living with him and the other half living with their mother who also lives not far from them in Los Angeles. The author is secure in her love for Jim and their marriage but does not realize the challenges she will be facing entering a household where there will be two teenagers and a dog. The author is  in her early forties, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter, and a single female. She was attending a National Association of Hispanic Journalists convention in Phoenix, Arizona when she met her future husband Jim Sterngold who was there working on a story for the Times. He asked her out for a drink and the rest is history. The author does an outstanding job of weaving her Puerto Rican cultural roots into the book and the emphasis and  importance of being close to family. I enjoyed reading about the author's Latina friends, both in Puerto Rico and in New York. Especially memorable is the description of life growing up in Puerto Rico and her mom's concerns that Mireya would die alone. The reader could easily understand and appreciate her mom's happiness when Mireya got married. This is an outstanding book in which the author shares memorable moments in her life, beginning and ending with Eddie but which grows into a story about what is really most important in any human life.

"I have tried a previous OZ Naturals skin care product, the Super Youth Eye Gel, and was very satisfied with the results in diminishing wrinkles and smoothing the skin below and around the eyes. I have used other skin care products which contained both hyaluronic acid and various botanical extracts and had excellent results: noticeable the same day within 15 - 20 min of use therefore anticipated good results with this product as well. This product lived up to my expectations and it does *exactly*  what is stated on the box: ""diminishes surface lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen."" I have used this serum daily over several days and can see a difference initially within 15 - 20 minutes after application (this is the truth).. Exactly what I expected as other products in the past gave me similar results within the same time frame. The smooth skin is even more noticeable within a couple of hours after use and continue throughout the day and for me last well into the next day. The first area of results is where I have smile lines on my cheeks, right below the corners of my nose. The wrinkles are *definitely* less evident, honestly almost gone, much smoother and the skin remains soft. Use the eye dropper applicator to apply a thin layer of the serum over the chosen area, let it dry, but first apply your choice of moisturizer. The ingredients in this product are clearly listed on the box: organic aloe, witch hazel, botanical hyaluronic acid, kosher vegetable glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, wild crafted green tea, germanium essential oil, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and a few other ingredients that help stabilize the product. I highly recommend this skin serum for anyone who wishes to reduce facial wrinkles and have the appearance of more youthful skin.

"In this book Mohammad Rehman introduces the reader to the main concepts of Islam as written in the  Holy Quran (translated from the Arabic into English by Abdulllah Yusuf Ali) which clearly states what the relationships, beliefs, and intentions of the Prophet Mohammed were toward Christians and Jews, who are regarded as people of the Abrahamic religion to which Islam also belongs. The Quran describes the correct and expected behaviors and actions of Muslims which are acceptable to God, those that promote harmony and a peaceful life and  after death, when judged in the afterlife, it becomes the basis for acceptance into heaven.  What the author does so very well is break down various concepts by chapter and verse, with explanations and analysis that he gives, comparing the correct concepts and behavior with the corrupt, evil behavior of current followers who have created a movement based on false precepts. What needs to be understood is that the Quran was written during the lifetime of the Prophet by his followers and that it is divided into thirty chapters and one hundred fourteen verses or surahs which is entirely complete. The author writes it is the constitution of Islam which therefore can not be changed, added or be bypassed. Mohammad Rehman states ""The Quran should not be followed up by any later written laws, such as the Hadith and Shariat, as it is authentic and whole as it was created, as the word of God.""The author dedicates his book to all those who suffered either because of their race, religion, ethnic origins or social standing (caste). He lists examples of world conditions and events which led to humanities suffering on a large scale: the killing during the Crusades, the Inca's being conquered by the Spanish, the tyranny of the British Empire, Japanese civilian deaths at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, various murders attributed to ethnic cleansing in the past and recently in modern times, the suffering of the Palestinians who are homeless and conquered in their own land, innocent victims who died during Sept 11, 2001, families and civilians who were killed during the Iraq War, and the war torn country of Afghanistan where ordinary civilians are struggling to live. He dedicates the book to just men who rose to save us. He mentions Gandhi, Dr. Martin Luther King and Sultan Salahuddin Ayubi, a Muslim leader who was a just follower of civil law and even treated prisoners with compassion. The author reviews Prophet Mohammad's life, how he received the revelations from God and how he conducted his life, with simplicity rather than living in riches and wealth.With significant detail, the author writes about four eras of Islam during which times very different emphasis was placed on its expression in the regions where Islam was practiced. The reader is provided a historical review of important Caliphs, the creation of the Sunni and Shi'ite sects, various revolts and rebellions and which sect conquered what region or existing country in the Middle East and Arabic peninsula at the time. Special emphasis is placed on the era between 749 AD and 945 AD when the compilation of the Shariah took place as well as writings associated with the Sunnat (the ways and teachings of the Prophet) as conveyed by his disciples. These two distinct writings took place about one century after the Prophet's passing. The author emphasizes that almost six or seven generations lapsed before the Sunnat was written which means errors of communication could have been passed down. About two hundred years passed when the Shariah laws were compiled in about 800 AD which could lead to mistakes in interpretation. Various important events associated with ruling dynasties and empires are discussed: Ayyubid Dynasty, Ghourid Dynasty, Safavid Shi'a Empire, Timuri Mugal Empire, Ottoman Empire and the Modern, Technical Era with changes in countries, such as Ottoman Empire and Turkey, Arabian Lands, Egypt, Iran,  India, Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria. Lastly, the author provides a historical overview of fifty countries in the world where Islam is the major religion. The author does a review of how each country fares in its true expression of Islam related to conduct of everyday life, political expression, wars, and their outcome, treatment of people, and social life. Overall, this is a superbly written book providing spiritual insights into the practical expression of Islamic culture and behavior from the ancient past into present times and just how far it has strayed from the original scripture and intent as written in the Quran. It is a courageous book in that the author dares to point out deficiencies in the practice of this religion in major countries of the world. It is not a highly politically charged and detailed analysis of misbehavior but a gentle overview of the religion, its historical expression in the past and in current times.

"Leonard Mlodinow has written a highly relevant and easily flowing book about scientific discoveries past and present that shaped the experiences of modern man. The author leads the reader on a great exploration of human development as a whole with questions that remain unsolved in modern physics, specifically quantum mechanics. What makes this book so fascinating and approachable for the ordinary reader is the author does not get bogged down in an inordinate amount of detail to lose anyone's interest.  This book is a great overview of the story of human development from the discoveries of anthropology and how primitive man learned to survive and changed both physically and mentally over two to three million years to become the species we are today. This is why the title of the book  ""The Upright Thinkers"" is so fascinating because it seems to have a dual meaning, ""upright"" in the sense of standing on two legs or bent over or on all four appendages and ""upright"" which is related to the behavior of mankind, its synonyms: honest, honorable, worthy, virtuous, principled, and noble. The author includes some personal anecdotes, memories of growing up and his family history round out the stories and provide glimpses into the author's thinking and love of science which enhance the reading pleasure.The chapters are divided logically and sequentially over time. The author provides a great discussion of the history of civilization where man's ""need to know"" initially was related to survival which then expanded over millions of years to creating instruments such as the telescope and eventually theories about the orbits of planets.  Eventually the observation of natural phenomenon,  such as  gravity lead to deeper understanding about what makes up our physical world. I enjoyed reading about Mesopotamia, the well known ""cradle of civilization"" where writing, farming, cities, and laws arose.  From Ancient Greece, philosophy and scientific observation gave us theories about the physical universe and nature. As knowledge progressed, science and religion clashed. Important libraries were developed to house the books written on medicine and astronomy. Interactions and learning were shared by different cultures. European universities were built and became important centers of learning to share scientific discoveries and ideas.The importance of mathematics and Galileo's discoveries opened the path to modern science. The author emphasizes how scientific observations which resulted in the laws of physics affects all change in our lives. It is the comprehensive laws of motion which opened up the field of physics to explore new scientific theories, make observations and create experiments using mathematical formulas to describe and explain quantum mechanics. Ever since the relationships between subatomic matter and energy have been explained and partly understood life on planet earth has not been the same. Needless to say, the author does an astonishing job of describing Newton's discoveries, importance of Rutherford's scientific observations about mysterious emanations (alpha, beta and gamma rays), Planck's quantum, Einstein's photon, the importance of Einstein's theory of relativity, Bohr's observations and experiments which lead to his new atomic theory and several others upon which all this science was built. All previous discoveries became the foundational framework upon which Heisenberg was able to build his revolutionary quantum theory called ""Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle"" which he explained was not really a principle but rather described the limitation of quantum mechanics. The author includes significant historical, social and world events which affected the lives of important scientists during the discovery of principles associated with quantum physics which provides a well rounded, fascinating context to understand the impact of this new science on the modern world. For those who love science and want to explore the mysteries of the universe this book will help you do it.

"This product is amazing in how it helps relax aging lines beneath the eyes, at the corners of the eyes and even on the cheek right below corners of the nostrils. It is easy to apply and is very cost-effective compared to similar products, in other words: it is worth the price! I am familiar with the effects of hyaluronic acid, which is included in two facial skin care products I have used. This is a common ingredient used for overall skin firming which I have used and I know it works. I have been looking for a product to use around the eyes and was very pleased when OZ Naturals offered me this complimentary item to try and then review for amazon. In all honesty I really love it! There is no scent, it has a gel- consistency which prevents wasting and is easy to apply. I do not have dark circles under the eyes and can not address this issue personally but recommend reading other reviews for their results.Another important ingredient is ""plant stem cells"" which are usually harvested from plants grown in labs. I know that the purpose of plant stem cells is to help renew tissue and regenerate growth of plant cells which means they will likely provide some similar benefit to living human skin cells. Other beneficial ingredients in this product are: various amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins and therefore will assist in repairing tissue and smooth the skin. Vitamin E is included which is an antioxidant. There are several other organic plant ingredients: periwinkle, licorice, eye bright, reishi, frankincense and gotu kola which anyone can research on-line to see what benefits they provide.

"This journal is a wonderful gift for yourself to keep and treasure to document beautiful memories, reminders of events, experiences, and people that you love. The journal can also be a gift to someone who has experienced some kind of loss as an inspiration to keep them hopeful in life by recording what they find most important and meaningful. The author Deborah Perdue organized the journal in a manner where she records one spiritual statement for a total of forty nine days. There are twenty pieces of artwork within the journal which are the artists rendition of the meaning of some of the spiritual statements.Some examples of the inspirational statements are: ""I am deeply grateful for my spiritual path which keeps me growing, changing and realizing the Divinity of life."" "" I am so grateful for letting go and letting life flow."" ""I am in gratitude for love and joy and peace and grace and ease and truth and beauty and wisdom.""""I am grateful for the dazzling radiance of the warm sunshine today.' ""Thank you Spirit within and all around for all the knowledge and wisdom infusing my mind and soul."" ""All is well and I am grateful."" Occasionally the page for one's personal record is on the page behind the artwork and opposite a spiritual statement. Other times, the spiritual statement is opposite the personal diary page. The personal record or diary page has calligraphy-like words in the right corner for the date and  below that the words, ""I am grateful for,""  with ten empty lines to be filled out by the owner of the journal. For anyone interested in reconnecting to their inner spirit, this journal will certainly be a helpful guide to reaching this goal.It would be most helpful to omit the word *date* on each journaling page. This change gives the writer freedom to date each gratitude entry and allows for more than a forty nine day record.  Some reviewers mention ""forty days"" of pages but I counted forty nine dated pages.. Perhaps they omitted counting the lined pages behind each piece of art. To record on the back of the artwork has pros and cons: the pros are the artwork could be used as a reference to very meaningful entries; the cons are the illustration can be marred by the pressure of the pen showing through. There should be a feeling of balance with reference to location of journaling pages: one page opposite either an inspirational statement or artwork is ideal, with forty nine lined pages and twenty pieces of art, this is not the case.

"Lydia Netzer is a great story teller who has developed her own unique erudite writing style in which she expresses emotions, decisions, and actions through metaphors that literally soar off the page. Her ability to enhance a story and develop a plot using mythical associations and references to astrophysics and the universe is very effective but can be daunting to the reader who is used to less complex techniques of making a significant point or twist in the plot. The author writes with lyricism, eloquence and fascinating phrasing from start to finish. This is an unusual sort of love story which arises through fate, chance or is it by the design of the universe or if one keeps reading each chapter, it may have been another unanticipated plan. The reader needs to  jump right in at the beginning which is the prologue what sets the stage for many surprising, unexpected events, twists and turns in the plot as the story of true love is explored. It begins with a search, meets resistance, and builds into its final climactic conclusion where all the mismatched pieces of the puzzle fit  together and explain the unexplainable.Initially, I was a bit put off by the first chapter, in which the author combines two disparate events: first, a detailed description of how Irene Sparks' mother passed away, Irene who has a Ph. D. in Astrophysics and her mom had been estranged, not speaking for the past few years, Irene lived in Pittsburgh, PA and did research in physics at a highly prestigious university. Second, right around the time of her mother's passing, Irene proved the existence of black holes by an elaborate experiment done in her lab, complete with the flash of violet light which was X-ray energy, absolute proof that was measurable and verified her data. Irene had proven what other astrophysicists had postulated! These two events: her discovery and her mom's death brought about one of Irene's secret desires: to return to Toledo and work at the Toledo Institute of Astronomy to carry out new research projects there. The events were realistic enough but a background or build up with some sensitivity toward her mother whom Irene loved in her own way would have improved the start of the novel for me.  A redesign is needed, as later the author provides the necessary background to Irene's life which allows the reader to understand her inner struggles and drive to succeed. Irene is a pure scientist who sees life as a series of rational decisions and lives according to her plans, although she allows herself a boyfriend who designs and develops video games. Her life course is on schedule and a steady course until she meets George Dermont, a professor and fellow scientist at the Toledo Institute of Astronomy whose approach to science and life is entirely different.George Dermont, Ph. D.,  is a third year post doctoral research fellow and favorite instructor of most female graduate students at the Toledo Institute of Astronomy. George is a dreamer and works ancient myths and stories into his science lectures. He is also handsome enough where if the female student is willing, the scientist does not resist his natural urges. His mother is a  well known, logical and successful lawyer, his father is a famous artist. George is looking for his soul mate and visits a psychic who describes some attributes of the woman of his dreams. As a child George was highly imaginative and creative. he developed an obsession with a fairy. His father understood, his mother did not. As an adult, George is obsessed with discovering his future wife and engages in various personal research endeavors in finding her. The author does an incredible job of building suspense, drama, and mystery as the two lives of very opposite people, Irene and George converge. The author introduces unusual elements of human experience the reader can not anticipate which complicates and divides the relationships of characters within the plot. In a most surprising twist of fate, the reader is provided explanations for complex developments within the plot that make this an astonishing, fascinating and intriguing novel that ends on a very satisfactory and joyful note. Due to the erudite writing style of the author, the fast pace, and unusual developments which created twists and turns in the plot, this book can feel overwhelming at times, and for this reason I deduct one star.  However, overall, I found the book very different and interesting.

"Barilla Veggie Penne is one of those products to which you are *immediately* attracted when shopping. The package tells you it is made of 25% vegetables and provides one full serving of vegetables with each 3/5 ounce portion. And you are tempted to try it: my advice is go right ahead because you will *not* be disappointed! The taste is really delicious after taking just one bite when you notice a hint of the vegetable flavor which adds to the pleasure of the meal. Besides the wonderful taste, the pasta is very attractive which makes a meal even more appealing! Recently I happened to make a very Italian looking plate of food (just because of what I had on hand): the outstanding Barilla Veggie Pasta (red),  cauliflower (white) and asparagus (green).

"Simon Sebag Montefiore has written an outstanding historical novel which accurately captures the feelings, thoughts, and atmosphere of Stalinist Russia immediately after World War II. The author creates astonishingly realistic characters and a series of events that begin in complete innocence and which crescendo and climax into surreal interrogations at the Lubyanka Prison of several high school aged students and also of two children who are ten years old and six years old respectively. They are accused of a cover up, a conspiracy against the Soviet government and Stalin himself. It all started when two important members of an innocent sounding, exclusive, but very secret Poetry Club reenacted a duel based on Pushkin's poetry and life. They wore authentic nineteenth century costumes and presumably used theatrical firearms. This reenactment took place on a very special day near a bridge when the Victory Parade was held on June 24, 1945 with Stalin in attendance, accompanied on a balcony by the highest Soviet dignitaries. The actors ended up dead as a result of the duel. When the local police investigate and discover who the victims are, they pass on the investigation to higher authorities, The complex nature of the crime that two dead students who are the children of high ranking Soviet officials is most astonishing in and of itself but when  the interrogators begin to round up their friends for questioning and take them to the most notorious prison in the Soviet Union, the parents and those aware of what these special circumstances mean  begin to fear for their lives and for the lives of their children. Most mind-boggling of all is that the interrogators accuse these students of a conspiracy against the government,  a plot against Stalin himself. Past history has demonstrated exactly what serious consequences follow when the role, authority and decisions of the exalted leader of the Soviet Union are questioned.The author created an historical novel,  a great work of literature which is a major contribution to understanding Russian culture, politics and history during the post World War II era. The author is a Russian historian and fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He engaged in meticulous research and loosely based his work on an actual event that occurred in 1943 at which time two children of Soviet officials were found dead, wearing costumes, which resulted in investigations, imprisonment, and banishment for those who were accused and found guilty. In this fictional novel, the author creates a highly believable, suspenseful plot based on the circumstances and relationships between all those affiliated with the Fatal Romantics' Club, those who attended the best school in Moscow named the Joseph Stalin Commune School, and the parents of the children, many of whom were highly important Soviet officials. The characters are highly developed and most impressive in their respective roles, both in fulfilling their duties and the expectations of family and society as well as expressing their true feelings and natures.The author creates tension, drama, romance, unexpected arrests, and imprisonment with great skill as the plot is gradually developed and explored related to new revelations which clarify how the authorities learned of the Poetry Club and their twisted interpretation of a secret book which came to light in which some thoughts and ideas were recorded by the leader of the club. The author. There are many surprises and a few unexpected twists toward the end of the novel that ties together the diverse pieces of this most fascinating surreal puzzle.

"Chapter Two is a personal and in depth look at the lives of two individuals who have achieved success and are reasonably comfortable in life but who are missing a personal, emotional, and physical connection to the opposite sex which they secretly desire but are reluctant to pursue. James Caan plays George Schneider, a successful author of books, whose wife died within the past year and who went on a world tour, trying to forget his grief but which in fact brought it all the more to the forefront. Jenny McCleod played to perfection by Marsha Mason is a working actress whose best friend Faye wants her friend to find love and romance in her life. George's  brother Leo (played by Joe Bologna) meets Jenny through Faye and believes Jenny would be the perfect date for George. The scene is set for matchmaking which works out much better than either Faye or Leo envisioned or anticipated: a whirlwind romance and marriage within a twenty two day period. As one might surmise, problems arose in the not too distant future and most of the film is devoted to a serious exploration of their emotions, expectations from marriage, and the past events which led to their sudden marriage and the emotional upheavals which accompanied it. Both Marsha Mason and James Caan are perfectly cast in their roles, stretching their acting abilities and skills to producing unforgettable characters.Since George and Marsha are in their early forties, the thought of dating again makes them extremely anxious. However, totally by chance, they  engage in conversation on the telephone for a much longer time than either one intended or expected when  George mixes up his notes with phone numbers and reaches Jenny by mistake. He is intrigued by her responses with their innuendos and double entends while joking. George hangs up, thinks about what Jenny said and calls back several times, each recognizing an interest in the other, and a growing connection they want to pursue. They find each other especially intriguing when the recognition arises that they are speaking to the very person their best friends wanted to introduce to the other.Especially poignant scenes arise on their honeymoon in what looks like Bermuda, where they stay at an ocean front cottage. The viewer anticipates trouble when learning that George and his deceased wife used to visit there in the past. One can only question their judgement as to why they even selected this location for the start of their presumed marital bliss, when any sane person would avoid it recognizing it could release a flood of emotions. It does indeed cause George to become cold and distant from Jenny. Jenny questions herself and her own desires, needs, while they are growing apart. After returning to New York, they agree to live in George's home. George withdraws and Jenny is sent adrift in her sadness. George takes a trip to California to confront himself and his feelings, leaving Jenny to wonder about the state of her marriage. When she goes to visit her home, she discovers Leo and Faye are using it for an affair. George returns and admits his true feelings to Jenny as they each realize the vulnerability and needs of the other and also recognize the strength of their feelings and resolve to build a new life together. This film is definitely long and intense, due to the subject matter it could not be anything else. I found it very engaging and became vested in wanting both characters to understand each other's emotions and work through their problems. I can understand how some people would find the film tedious and too personally dramatic. While some of the film is light-hearted comedy most of the film consists of dramatic, emotionally intense moments and conversations related to processing personal issues and needs. People who love conflict resolution will love this film.

"These 18Kt gold plated earrings are in a class by themselves! They possess a flawless design: a large round cut white cubic zirconia in the center which is surrounded by small white round cut cubic zirconia. Few jewelers with the naked eye could distinguish between these clear shimmering, glittering cubic zirconia and real diamonds. Especially appealing for me is the fact that yellow gold is used which makes the white stones stand out even better due to the contrast in colors. The post is ideally placed in the center (on the back) allowing for the eyes to truly appreciate the classical elegance and romantic appeal of the design. These earrings are beautifully designed, meticulously crafted, and solidly made. The ORROUS and Company Legacy Collection of jewelry are among my favorite designs and I can not imagine anyone who would be unhappy with any of their exclusive earrings.

"Tyler McMahon captures the essential nature of El Salvador in this highly captivating, engaging, and most interesting novel. El Salvador has unsurpassed natural foliage and unspoiled beaches where huge waves crash onto the shore and possess large curls ideal for surfing. It has mountain villages and in this fictional novel places named Punta Roca, Puerto La Libertad  and Puerto del Diablo. There are dense green forested areas where bananas and mangoes grow. It is a country with poor people who work hard for the essentials and basics in life and some are even willing to sell or trade their home and land for the dream and opportunity to live and work in America. Others are willing to take advantage of the poor and some are willing to exploit the needs and desires of inexperienced young Americans who cross their path. Idealistic American youth, mostly in their early twenties, volunteer for the Peace Corps to work for very little money, to help build  new structures and provide farming techniques to improve the lives of these people and gain a new perspective on this Third World Country.  While most American youth who bring their knowledge, work ethic, and ideals to help this poor society are well rounded and successful, some have additional emotional baggage, personal problems  they are forced to confront and resolve. The vulnerable  are ripe to fall into  traps set by unscrupulous locals. A few El Salvadorans work at night stealthily collecting large crates which arrive on shore, that are disturbed by shady characters who sell the fine white powder to those hooked on the substance and willing to buy it at the current market value. If you are interested in reading about great surfing, romance, adventure, natural disasters, drug deals gone wrong, the culture, climate, and social environment of El Salvador with a great and believable set of characters, plus an interesting twist and surprise ending, you will enjoy this book. This book is most highly recommended.

"This may be the best timed book about what it felt like living in Cuba during the late 1950s and early 1960s right before the Cuban Revolution given that President Obama announced opening up diplomatic relations with this one and only Communist country in the Western Hemisphere. Celso Gonzalez-Falla lived during this time and is now in his early eighties, the author left Cuba at age 26 in 1961. Although this book is fiction, I have no doubt the author's life experience is mirrored highly accurately. This book is based on people he knew or fictional characters created out of his imagination based on behaviors and personality characteristics of people he knew.  What is most impressive and appealing about this book is it feels real, is totally engaging and describes realistically an historical era and geopolitical region of the world that is still very important today. The author writes about a thriving pre-revolutionary Cuba, where there was a successful economy based on capitalism which worked, although everyone did not live in the same lifestyle, neither did Communism provide a better quality of life for the majority of Cubans who did not leave the island. The reader gets a feel for the pre-Communist regime where politicians, powerful successful businessmen and the police usually worked in unison, i.e., for the good of society as a whole or at times they were trying to gain some advantage, exploiting the common people, to control some aspect of society. What stands out most in this book is the vibrant culture and the expressive people who helped create the feeling that Cuba was special. This book is highly recommended for anyone who wants to sense and feel the Cuba of the past.

"This was the classic Viet Nam era film that was made during the time when the war was dividing the nation. The difference between this film and others produced in this era is this one does not depict war scenes. Instead, this film concentrates on the emotional effects of the war on soldiers who were willing to serve but returned changed men with a wholly different view of what it means to be a patriot. The motivation to serve their country with honor and distinction, to do their duty was the impetus, along with being drafted however the results and outcomes were different: men returned with broken bodies and broken spirits.The film begins when Sally Bender (played by Jane Fonda) and her husband Bob (played by Bruce Dern), a Captain in the Army, are separating as he is sent to Viet Nam. He looks forward to this mission due to his outlook that he is serving his country. Sally has always been a housewife and is bored living alone so she volunteers at the local Veterans hospital. There she meets Luke, whom she recalls was the captain of the football team at her high school when she was a cheerleader. Luke returned from Viet Nam with war injuries which resulted in paralysis. Luke had returned with a different view of the war than when he initially went. There is a highly charged scene in which he gives an ""anti-war"" speech before an assembly of students which contrasts with the clean cut soldier in uniform, who provides an entirely opposing viewpoint.After Sally and Luke meet, they make an emotional connection based on their past. They also fall in love and have a physical relationship knowing full well it may rock or destroy Sally's marriage. Each is fully aware of the possible problems, consequences, and complications which may arise when Sally's husband returns. It happens that he returns earlier than his tour of duty due to injuries he sustained which are not serious but for which he will receive a medal. Unfortunately, he learns of the liason between his wife and Luke the wounded Viet Nam War veteran through unusual channels. All of them must confront their conflicting emotions associated with the Viet Nam war and also the fall out associated with a potential break up of the marriage. Needless to say, this is a thought-provoking film which sheds light on multiple viewpoints, strong emotions and problems which were prevalent in the era. Most highly recommended, excellent film.

"This is a beautiful set of earrings that are stunning and elegantly designed. Most astonishing is they have the appearance of solid gold when in fact they are 18 Kt gold plated. They are a high quality product for a very reasonable price. The pearls are of good size and stably anchored onto the posts. Each earring post is long enough to fit any sized pierced ear. There are baguette cut cubic zirconia which create a petal-like effect of three clusters around the base of the earring which holds the pearl. The baguettes capture and reflect light which resembles real diamonds. The only concern I have is the ability of the 18Kt gold  bonding to withstand the test of time, hopefully the gold bonding will last a life time of wearing without eroding  down to the base metal. Often base metal consists of nickel, if this is the case, I will have an allergic reaction to it. Keep in mind, this concern applies to any jewelry that is gold bonded. Only time will tell and I *promise* to update this review should this occur. Overall, this is a highly impressive, well made set of earrings and I highly recommend buying them as a gift for yourself or someone special.

"If you love roller skating and disco music spiced up with a bit of romance, drama and conflict where the underdog wins, you will enjoy this film. Linda Blair stars as Terry Barkley who breaks away from the high expectations of her wealthy parents by roller skating at the Venice Beach in California. There she meets Bobby played by Jim Bray, a former competitive skater whose skill is astonishing. She needs a break from the social pressure placed on her by their plans for her future career as a music major and classical flutist. Her father is a lawyer with a lucrative career in financial law, her mother is a homemaker and socialite. Both seem to take her for granted, Terry breaks free from the social role they envision for her by pursuing her hobby of roller skating which expresses her freedom and individuality.Terry surprises her upper class close friends by socializing with a different crowd and immensely enjoys her new found freedom where nothing matters but the talent and skills of roller dancing. Terry eventually breaks through the restrictive  social barriers and becomes accepted by the ""ace"" roller skater Bobby. There is a roller disco contest planned at Jammers,  the roller rink which runs into a major problem.  The owner is threatened by a big time businessman mobster and his strong arm men. They force him to sign a contract to sell the rink to the business developer of a mall which they plan to build. Unknown to them, one of the roller skaters inadvertently taped the threatening conversation. Terry tries to enlist her father's help to save Jammers but he refuses. When Terry is performing with the Barkley Musical Quartet at a garden party, her friends show up and recognize the mobster businesssman and his associates, all kind of havoc results.

The manner in which they help solve this major problem and save Jammers is well executed. Especially satisfying is how Terry's father eventually recognizes and realizes the legal quandary into which his high paying client placed him.and  he had to concede his daughter and her friends were right. It is a pleasure to watch events unfold and how the matter is resolved in favor of the Jammers owner and the Roller Disco skaters.

"Today at 1:34 PMIt is a pleasure to view this comedy which creates humor from situations and events that arise from contrasting differences between two cultures which have varying social values and clearly proscribed behaviors between social classes. Best of all, it is amazing how the writers managed to convey respect for the Middle East or Arabic culture  without offending the values which they uphold. Interestingly, this was before it was ""politically correct"" to do so. Fortunately, this film does not resort to mockery, derision or vulgarity which is highly remarkable as the film originated in Hollywood where in modern times low class behavior substitutes for good clean comedy and writing talent. The plot revolves around a sheik who is staying at the posh Beverly Hills Hotel and when he enters the lobby and makes eye contact with an attractive blonde haired, blue eyed young American woman. It is clear they have an interest in each other and he would love to meet her but his royal position demands he maintain a serious demeanor.  He can not make any overtures to get her attention or socialize with her. Not only because of his social status but because he is accompanied by guards who watch his every move. Along come the parking lot attendants who see the chemistry and want to intervene to help him out. A few, empathize with his situation of desiring someone of the opposite sex who is unattainable. The contrasts between the two social classes makes for great humor and even more satisfying is how the parking lot attendants come to his rescue, create diversions which allow for the ""forbidden"" contact with the lovely woman.I enjoyed seeing a young Robert Hegyes play Tico, one of the parking lot attendants who takes on the role of ""solving"" the sheik's problem with this beautiful young lady. Another charming role was played by a young Melanie Griffiths.  Especially enjoyable was seeing Frank Gorshin play Fred Kruger, head of security. He is confounded by the many antics and behavior of the parking lot attendants. It was particularly funny when he made arrangements to have a date in an unoccupied room with an attractive new female desk clerk. It just so happened, the parking lot attendants were using that room for their own purposes and had to clear the room out in a hurry to make it presentable and ready for Kruger and his date. I was most impressed by Kario Salem who played the sheik, he was very handsome and had such a close resemblance to Ben Affleck that it makes me wonder why he never made it into other more well known roles and films. Overall, this was a well made fun comedy which came to a satisfying conclusion. While some scenes were overdone as often happens with slapstick comedies it truly remains a good clean fun entertaining film.

"My interest in this book was piqued due to the high acclaim, awards and recognition it received in Brazil. It won two prestigious awards one even being named 'best novel.'  I expected to admire the writing and love the book. I was seriously disappointed.The book consists of  sixty eight vignettes, unconnected chunks and pieces of life events, information, glimpses into various aspects of people's lives, people who come from all classes and walks of life. The descriptions seem and feel random and are nonlinear, giving the sense of a bustling, high energy city, teeming with life and movement. The collage of information conveyed is tied together by two themes: first, all of it is happening on May 9. 2000 and second it is all happening in Sao Paolo, Brazil.For me, the style of writing does not work: it is disjointed and hard to follow. It is as if, a filmmaker took whatever was odd, unusual or unique in ""you tube"" videos and pieced them together into one film with the only commonality being, the day and the place. The book feels like a hodge podge of events, some are just descriptions of something unique about the city, other descriptions include some life event of a person or a group. If the author's purpose was to capture the feeling of confusion: he succeeded beyond his wildest imagination. There is definitely the feeling of loss, the loss of sense of self, but as a reader I do not want to be confused or lost when reading a book. I wish a sense of purpose, I read to discover something to enjoy or appreciate within the book and this book leaves me feeling empty and unsatisfied.While, to an extent, I understand the author's purpose, the impetus that drove him to to write in this style, it could have been written better, as a series of short stories where one can get a hook into personal stories and lives. The impersonal nature of city life, the nature of being an impartial observer is known to anyone who has lived in a large city. Anyone who lived in a large city can feel the energy, the  drive, the movement, the differences between classes of people, who engage in a hustle to live and find meaning in the expanse of it all. One can feel lost in the shuffle of everyday activities. I would have preferred stories that describe life, behaviors and expression of values the various classes of people who live in Sao Paolo, Brazil.This book would have been much better if it had been a series of short stories which would have provided a window into the lives of workers, residents, people from all walks of life, to understand  their feelings, their goals, their successes, their losses, to find out what drives them to live. Instead, this reader was left feeling lost, dizzy and disoriented. A one word summary of this book: confusing. A one word recommendation to buy: don't. Yes, I think the author is a highly talented writer but he chopped up the stories into disconnected chunks creating serious discontinuity.

"Managing the impossible until now, Prisoner 5995, aka Peanut stealthily maneuvered down dark corridors of the Prison located in Qinghai Province, Western China and evaded detection of the thunder, as the prison guards were called, for their booming voices and lightning speed use of punishment for perceived infractions. Despite the punishment he endured in the past for being accused of gathering state secrets, when he recorded a personal diary of his prison life on any scrap of paper he managed to collect, he took the risk of escape and amazingly succeeded. Peanut walked along a wall in the dark, to a dark gravel pit, where he hid while the dogs searching for him barked and the thunder roared but did not locate him. Adam Brookes paints a realistic picture of the bleak circumstances Peanut endured in prison, the courage it took for him to escape and the subterfuge in which he engaged to bring into reality the plan he hatched and dreamed about while imprisoned: to leave China, get a new identity and start a life in a free country. The author engages the readers attention immediately with his artistic use of words and phrases which capture all the senses, sight, sound, taste, touch, and even the sixth sense of what is about to happen ...Peanut has the ability to access information about China's progress on defense missiles and their transport. His goal is to hook someone who can contact the British Intelligence agency for whom Peanut had spied in the past. He contacted Philip Mangan, a free lance reporter who wrote articles that are original and timely on political and social aspects of China's development. Peanut was certain, Mangan would pass the copies to the correct British authorities, who would immediately recognize the value of the documents. Mangan got more deeply involved and was recruited as a British agent, despite his objections  because the British knew that Peanut trusted him and only him with these secrets. Peanut started the ball rolling in the direction he had planned which was moving at the right speed, he controlled his own destiny at last.I love how the author ties together the past and present circumstances of Peanut's life and the complicated political events which resulted in his imprisonment. The author very deftly creates a novel filled with espionage, intrigue, political tension, and modern global conflicts related to the race for armaments and defense. Peanut learns to avoid detection by authorities as he surreptitiously and skillfully obtains top secret documents, which he knows are the key to his ultimate survival and the ticket out of Communist China. The author writes with knowledge and purpose and keeps the reader's attention engaged as each chapter reveals new complex events and barriers which are overcome to achieving Peanut's ultimate goal. It is hard to believe this is a first novel for the author, he is a natural born writer.

"This is a charming romantic comedy which revolves around the friendship and eventual romance that develops between two rival speech writers who are working for opposing candidates vying for the Senate seat in New Mexico. Most of the comedy arises from trying to resolve the inevitable tension and conflicts which arise from this complicated association, where doing a good job means being critical of the rival's candidate and yet not making it a personal matter that could destroys or poison their true feelings for each other. Their respective bosses are running for the vacant Senate seat and each team is doing their utmost to persuade the voters *their* candidate will work harder on issues most important to them. The teams are doing their best to outsmart the opposition in winning votes and use creative techniques which at times are totallly hilarious.Michael Keaton plays Kevin Vallick, a former Hollywood sitcom writer, turned speech writer for the Republican candidate Garvin. Julia Mann played by Geena Davis is the speech writer for Wannamaker the Democratic candidate. They unexpectedly meet at midnight at the hotel's gift shop trying to buy the same box of Nytol, a non-narcotic sleeping agent for their common malady, insomnia. The next day, they meet again and develop a budding friendship which leads to a drive across the border to Mexico on the spur of the moment. At this point they do not yet know each others true roles, Kevin acknowledges his past job as sitcom writer and when he reads Julia's name tag on her jacket, which identifies her as a newspaper reporter, neither corrects the misconception about their current positions. They have a terrific time in Mexico and both are acutely aware that it has become a budding romance, the implications of which are on the minds of each. After they return and are met by members of their candidate's team, both fully realize the true job of the other and the impact it will have on their relationship.Conflicts and tension arise regarding their true feelings because they are required to make their candidate look good at the expense of the other. Add into this mix, the arrival of Julia's boyfriend, Bob Freed, a documentary specialist, who eventually becomes engaged to Julia and yet remains clueless about Kevin and Julia's intimate feelings and their recent fling. Nearing the finish, the race for the Senate seat becomes even more blood thirsty and cut-throat. Kevin is incapacited after a night of revelry with Julia although he was the more aggressive writer is unable to write his speech for Garver. Julia is more idealistic and issue oriented, can not awaken Kevin and cares enough about him to write the script for him; it shows Garver in a whole new light: family oriented, sensitive to creating jobs and overall in touch with what matters most to the voters. After this episode, Garver is in the lead,  that is, until a leak about his accepting bribes is made public  after which Wannamaker jumps ahead and wins the nomination. Needless to say, this becomes the ultimate clash which nearly shatters the relationship between Kevin and Julia beyond repair. .It is a pleasure to watch the resolution to the confllicts between the candidates and even more grat fun to see how Julia and Kevin recognize and acknowledge their true feelings for each other in a very public display. The actors are all phenomenal This was an enjoyable and satisfying film and is highly recommended.

"With great skill, personal knowledge, and detailed craftsmanship, Haggai Carmon creates a riptide effect, a powerful force that pulls the reader into a complex world of deception, traps, and espionage. The author opens up a whole new world where disguises, lies, and stealth are normal. Undercover operations are devised to elicit information about enemy activities, deals and plots, which are threats to the real world. Some men risk their lives to free individuals who chose to defect from the totalitarianism under which they live. The defectors possess specialized knowledge and skills which is shared in exchange for their freedom. This knowledge will be used to stop the enemy from gaining further  information, technology, and control/power over innocent people. The life of subterfuge is loaded with risks, it is a ""fight to the finish"". Espionage places not only the life of the spy at great risk but also the lives of everyone closely associated with him.In this novel, the lead character, Dan Gordon is a brilliant tactician, a highly trained field agent who works best as a 'lone wolf', he is the ideal candidate to help General Cyrus Madani, aka code name TANGO, escape from Iran and defect to the US. This operation,is a joint effort by the CIA and Mossad, if successful would land on of the biggest blows against the Iranian nuclear race in modern times. This defector would reveal Iran's progress in building a nuclear bomb in exchange for living in the relative safety of the US under a new identity for himself and his family. Two miles from the border of Armenia and Iran, General Cyrus Madani is visible within fifty yards to freedom, when gunfire erupts from all directions and Dan Gordon is told to abort the mission. To his utter dismay, Dan Gordon is ordered to leave the area and return to headquarters. He is stunned but he obeys. He learns that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards must have been tipped off due to the gunfire which arose. Furthermore,  telephoto lens pictures revealed discrepancies between the known images of TANGO and the candidate who was crossing the border. Although they looked very much alike, the descrepancies revealed he was a double, in other words, a fake. This unexpected development sent a ripple effect within the team who worked so tightly to free TANGO from Iran. They were on board with the decision to break all barriers to locate and free the *real* General Cyrus Madani from Iran.TEMPEST was the code name for the new team responsible for identifying, cultivating, and supporting Iranian scientists and key military personnel to defect. The US Consulate in Dubai had received a letter written in Farsi from a ""friend"" who would act as intermediary on behalf of as yet unnamed Iranian scientist who wanted to defect. Again, the chase was on - to determine whether or not this request was real. Dan Gordon enters the picture, this time in disguise as Mr. Jaap Van der Hoff, who represents his company located in the Netherlands which trades in electronic components for industrial use. The company's goal  is to penetrate the Iranian market, known to be hungry for new technology, but without alerting the Americans. Dubai is known world wide to be a den of thieves, disguised as legitimate businessmen, complete with all the proper credentials to support their claims. This book takes on an entirely new dimension of deception few readers can anticipate or imagine. I totally enjoyed reading about Dan Gordon becoming Alexander Yager, a lingerie businessman visiting Damascus, Syria who made inroads to buying lingerie for his German department store when he was on a mission of an altogether different nature. I loved his chameleon change into Dieter Kraus which provided him access to visiting Tehran, Iran. Especially revealing was the partial Oriental Express train ride from Tehran to Ankara, Turkey where he became Daniel Patrick Leahy, complete with family history, occupation and the new passport to prove it. Let me just say that the gravy, I mean plot, thickens in Turkey, along with a new spicy side dish, a local specialty which will be a complete surprise to the reader! Without hesitation I give my highest endorsement to this espionage novel.

"Robert DeNiro plays Frank Goode, the father of four who is trying to emotionally connect with his adult children shortly after his wife passed away. He arranges a get together but each of his children make excuses why they can not attend. Frank realizes life is precious and all too short and he wants to express his true feelings of love to his family which he found hard to do in the past. He realizes his role as head of the household and breadwinner placed him into a distant second to his wife, in whom his children confided. Due to his health problems, he wants to reestablish and strengthen the family bonds. He wants to ensure his family understands how important they are to him before it is too late and with this goal in mind, he ventures forth to visit all of his adult before it is too late. His adult children moved away from home to distant parts of the country to pursue their passions and build their lives, he decides to visit each one to see how they are doing.From Elmira, NY Frank visits New York City to his eldest son's apartment but his son does not answer the door, apparently he is not at home. Frank had called him many times by phone but there was no answer so he resorted to the surprise visit. He placed an envelope beneath the door, with a photo of the family as children and a note to his son. Since he hates to fly airplanes, Frank decides to take a Greyhound bus trip across country to see his other three children, Robert, whom he believes is a musical conductor in an orchestra, Rosie who live in Las Vegas and is pursuing her dream job as a performing artist, and Amy, a happily married mom living out West. The film masterfully conveys emotion and meaning through flashbacks which portray Frank's memories of his children when young and growing up. These film clips highly effectively peel away the layers of time to expose Frank's love and caring tender attitude as a father much more strongly than if described in words.Needless to say, Frank learns that his children were holding back much information about themselves which he recalls was not the case with their mother. They talked to her about their personal lives and revealed themselves, opened up in ways they never did with him. He sees they incorporated the valuable and difficult lessons he taught them about life and they have made their own path in the world, expressing themselves as they discover their strengths and survival skills. After discovering Robert is not the conductor but rather is a percussionist in the orchestra (he plays the drums) which suits him just fine, Frank is told Robert is leaving on tour with the orchestra which cuts the visit with his father short. Frank leaves on the bus to travel further out west to visit his daughter Amy. Amy calls Robert that their dad was not on the bus as expected. A series of phone calls ensues, with messages left back and forth, trying to track down the location of their dad. He had missed the correct bus due to a time zone change and hitched a ride on a truck which got him to the railroad station that had a connection to Las Vegas. Rosie ( played by Drew Barrymore) went all out to impress her dad with her successful career in Las Vegas, she rented a stretch limousine which drove them to her high rise penthouse suite. However, Frank overheard an answering machine message left by the owner of the suite that he was returning early. Again, Frank awakened to the fact that his daughter was not being honest and open with him. Gradually, over a spaghetti dinner,  they had a heart to heart talk about the past and the truth about her life was revealed to him. Frank was not shocked or disappointed. All that mattered to him was that her life was on course and that she was happy.He decided to go back to New York earlier than anticipated and allow his children lead their own lives, satisfied they were doing well, but he had misgivings about David, his eldest from whom he had not heard. Out of character for him, he chose to return to NY by airplane, even though he hated to fly. He did not reveal to any of them a mishap which occurred at the railroad station, where his medication was spilled and crushed. While in fight, he looked out the airplane window and saw storm clouds and lightening. The stewardess reassured him, the pilot would fly around the storm, not through it and that it was safe to do so. During a bit of turbulence, Frank went to the bathroom and experienced what seemed like a panic attack but he was clutching his chest and was short of breath. The stewardess sensed a problem since he did not return to his passenger seat. An ambulance met them as the landed which drove Frank to the hospital.Frank is lying in the hospital bed, surrounded by his children when he awakens. He senses their love and concern but eminently feels the absence of David, his eldest son. He confronts his children and elicits they answer his questions about David, with the whole truth. Amy tenderly and carefully tells him, David died of an overdose in Mexico, around the time he was visiting  his children out west. When Frank falls asleep he experiences a flashback of David as a child receiving instructions from his father. Frank also has a vision of David as an adult, waving good-bye and reassuring him, he was a good father and David's death had was not his father's fault. After he is released from the hospital, there is a poignant scene when Frank visits the cemetery where his wife is buried and he talks with her about the family. The final and last scene is the family reunion Frank had originally planned: a Thanksgiving dinner in Elmira, New York, in the house where they grew up. This time, all three of his children and their offspring are present, with David and their mom there in spirit. Despite all the changes in their lives, the family is together and the bonds are strong if not stronger than ever before. This is a most touching and realistic film about what matters most in life: family, love and acceptance.

"This 1972 film is about the inner feelings and personal lives of four policemen working for the LAPD. It is as relevant today as when it was made. It sends a very important message to society. The focus of the film is the emotional impact which the job has on specific individuals. Each of them deals very differently with the unexpected situations they encounter during their work life and therefore the residual feelings which remain hidden or buried is dealt with differently by each individual as well. The lives of these policemen are interwoven, as they are a team, doing a job for society, ensuring laws are followed and society as a whole is kept safe. George C. Scott plays Andy Kivinsky, a veteran police officer with 25 years on the job. He is partnered with Roy Fehler (played by Stacy Keach) who is a rookie. It is department policy to train new guys to this complex job in this manner and it makes sense. Roy is assigned to the Vice Squad which places great strains on his marriage causing it to end. Initially, Roy had planned to attend law school but due to life's twists and turns, he got married and had a daughter and the realities of earning a living led him into law enforcement as a job. The accusations which fly between Roy and his wife as they break up is superbly acted and provides insights into how a marriage with a solid foundation eventually becomes shaken and falters to the breaking point. Kivinsky was retiring after 25 years of service in the police force. At the farewell party, it is evident he has mixed feelings about leaving, perhaps unresolved issues. He was heavily invested in the relationships with his fellow officers. His plan are to retire to Florida where his family resides.In order to mask his true feelings of depression, Roy Fehler began to drink. It became a problem because he even resorted to taking the occasional gulp of courage while on the job. Gus Plebesly, played by Scott Wilson, is his new partner who caught Roy breaking this code of conduct related to his job. Gus is a father and family man who takes his role as provider and family man seriously. He was taking night courses at the academy to qualify for a promotion and become a sergeant. He became Roy's partner after Klivinsky retired. Gus had Roy's back and he supported his partner, trying to help him work through his personal problems more effectively. Klivinsky returns to LA from Florida to visit with his old friends but everyone seems too busy to socialize with him. Klivinsky drops a few hints on the telephone about the difficulties he has living with his family and coping with retirement. It falls on deaf ears. He wrestles with his personal demons and sadly, in the end, the demons won.While on assignment to investigate a burglary, Roy and Gus interview Lorrie the victim of a robbery. Lorrie reads Roy's name tag and recognizes his name but he has no recollection of their having met. She asks him, ""How are you?"" to which he replies, ""Not so good."" She reveals that when he was hospitalized, she and the other nurses did not expect him to survive the wounds he sustained on the job. They made an unexpected personal connection that each recognized could lead to something more meaningful. However, just when Roy Fehler feels his life is coming together in a good way, fate intervenes once more. The reader will have to view the film to discover the new twist in Roy's life which changes his life course forever.This film is a rare gem which treats sensitive issues in the lives of policemen in a very respectful and dignified manner, revealing the day to day struggles they face in their chosen profession. The film does not exaggerate their role. It does not portray them as super heroes nor does it vilify them. The impression left on me is that men with different strengths and qualities are drawn into this profession for their own personal reasons and they work very hard to perform their duties for society to the best of their abilities. Policemen come from all segments of society and like all human beings deserve to be respected and treated with dignity, despite what is reported by the modern media, no profession should be judged by the actions of a few.

"This small volume is rich in content. It contains stories which will impact the reader in a strong way by illustrating the values and principles of  ancient Jewish teaching via real life experiences of  both ordinairy and extraordinairy people. It stands as a testament to the foundations of Judeo-Christian values which unfortunately are eroding in the modern world.  It is a slim volume which is packed with meaning and important lessons. In the modern world it is too easy to make excuses and explain away one's personal failure to act. These stories show courageous people who stood up for truth, decency and honesty.  These stories show people who built lives based on integrity. They dared to stand up for what they believed worth fighting for even at great risk to themselves. It is getting rare to meet people who ""do the  right thing"", live up to a high moral code of behavior, and  who do not compromise in the face of  great resistance ... but as these true stories illustrate these kinds of people still *do* exist in today's world. At the core of their being is what in is termed ""good character"" which is more valuable than money and possessions. In the end it becomes the key to a successful and happy life, where the rest of what generally is viewed as important in a successful life: good health and wealth generally follows.

"When you see the words ""National Geographic"" these words immediately come to mind: high quality, adventure, world travel, ecology, and culture and the traveler using this book will find all this to be true and much more.  The book is well designed and will appeal to the novice and experienced traveler alike. The photos and experiences described in the book are of nine distinctly different unique regions of Peru each provides a very special, exciting, travel opportunity to experience what many only dream about. The authors' expertise is evident in their incredible attention to detail which makes this guide stand out from other travel guides. They provide sections on how to travel wisely giving special precautions to take, list established hotels, hostels and lodges along with recommended restaurants in all the regions. They also give guidance about public transportation such as buses, taxis and trains.Especially helpful is the critically important information they cover about reaching Machu Picchu from Cusco. Unless you are hiking the Inca Trail, the only other way to get there is to take the train from Aguas Calientes which has three levels of service. The practical considerations and guidance given is extremely valuable. Keep in mind, that you will be going up as high as 18,886 feet or 5,750 meters so it would be wise to condition your body *gradually* to this high altitude to  receive maximum enjoyment from this ""not to be missed"" experience of a lifetime. While the only symptom of altitude sickness most people might feel is a headache, they suggest those who are hesitant or know they will have some difficulty should acclimatize their body first. They can do this by transferring from the Cusco airport to the Sacred Valley town of Urubamba (9,416 feet/ 2,800 meters) or Ollantaytambo (9,187 feet/ 2,800 meters) to stay at any of several good hotels from where they can arrange to visit Machu Picchu and other sites.If this sounds appealing: visiting an off-the-beaten path indigenous markets, viewing a special seabird named ""Peruvian booby"", observing sea lions in their natural habitat, eating at the largest seafood buffet named in the Guinness Book of World Records located in Costa Verde in Lima, staying at a lodge in the highlands to see how farmers raise alpaca, residing in a guesthouse on a floating island in Lake Titicaca, hiking  the 39 kilometer (24  mile ) long  Inca Trail in the Andes or a portion of it, visiting the Inca ruins at Machu Picchu and viewing  jaw dropping scenery, visiting museums filled with Inca treasures in old historical cities such as Lima, Cusco or Trujillo or magnificent cathedrals dating back many centuries, and witnessing astonishing historically significant architecture then this book is for you! This book emphasizes travel that conserves wildlife, preserves history, enriches culture, gets the most value for your money, respects and appreciates local customs and traditions, and  provides diverse outdoor activities and supports archaeological adventures.

"David S. Brody has written an electrifying, entertaining, and educational fictional novel that combines irresistible topics into a search for the truth. The search involves uncovering the provenance of an ancient bracelet (author's imagination) which eventually leads to discovering how C.I.A. covert operations at one time included brainwashing techniques, i.e. mind  control or more accurately behavioral modification methods which had ties to the Smithsonian Institute (verifiable facts). In this book the author creates a wide range of exciting suspenseful events associated with true archeological findings many of which are about giant bones and bursts of action-packed moments related to C.I.A tactics (verifiable) which enliven the plot all working toward a resolution to the main issue which in this story ends at the Smithsonian Institute. The one and only important question is, why was the ancient bracelet made available to Cameron Thorne and his fianc Amanda Spencer-Gunn so easily? It was found in a white box which came along with the Chinese take- out home order food delivered to Cam and Amanda. In the same box they found an old newspaper article which described the theft of the bracelet and how it was discovered in Tennessee with the Bat Creek Stone which dated around 200 A.D. and had an ancient form of Hebrew etched into it. The myriad of new directions in which this story winds will mesmerize the reader and keep them hooked! The reader will enjoy the great chase to determine the ancient origins of the bracelet which is not without great peril to those who undertake this monumental task.With great precision and skill in just the first thirty five pages the author stuns the reader into full attention. He weaves astonishing subjects into the plot starting first with an amusing lecture at an alternative history conference by a French anthropologist/archeologist conspiracy theorist who takes himself a bit seriously. His topic is the how the genealogy of European monarchies, ancient Israeli and Egyptian royalty and rulers descended from a unique species that will make the reader laugh out loud. Cameron Thorne followed this lecture on an unusual topic of his own but which was more believable: how the Freemasons and Knights Templar influenced European exploration of America before Columbus. A spry, leprechaun-like, well educated, elderly gentleman, Randall Cid, who spoke with an upper class Bostonian accent and showed an understated sense of humor, introduced himself to Cam. He demonstrated a keen interest and personal knowledge of the Freemasons but dropped a bombshell on Cam: Randall was retired from the C.I.A.. He also shared his insider knowledge that Cam was targeted by the C.I.A. for brainwashing or more accurately behavior modification, that is, to influence Cam's behavior in the direction they wanted. Randall's entry into their lives provides new twists and turns in the plot no one can anticipate. In addition to his charisma, extraordinary knowledge and C.I.A. experience, he adds spice, energy and spark to the divergent avenues and new directions that are explored. However, it is Randall's hidden past that comes to haunt him in ways even he could not imagine which results in a highly explosive but most satisfying ending to the book! Another seemingly tangential person within the plot is Webster Lovecraft a 61 year old presidential candidate who has strong views on certain political topics. He has a large physical stature, almost seven feet tall with ancestry that includes Cherokee Indian. Georgia Johnson, who used to be a C.I.A. agent, is now his political strategist in his candidacy bid for president. She is friends with Cam Thorne and his fianc Amanda. They met when the couple adopted their nine year old daughter. They consult Georgia regarding the real or potential C.I.A. involvement in their lives and also when their search for the truth uncovers some distinctively peculiar findings. The author demonstrates his well- honed literary talent and expertise in connecting C.I.A. tactics, mysterious events and discoveries, and key players within the story into a cohesive whole which includes a surprise ending, that most readers do not see coming!The author's major achievement is his ability to weave unusual authentic archeological evidence into the plot which makes reading this book a spell-binding experience. He solves a mystery by threading verifiable evidence into the story. He creates suspense and drama effectively enacting the scenes with multidimensional believable characters who have identifiable personality traits and quirks.  One jaw dropper is the accidental discovery (most often by farmers) in the 1800s of the bones of giants, often associated with burial mounds scattered throughout North America. He included Cherokee Indian legends and oral history which mention ancient explorers of Middle Eastern descent confirmed by writing left on tablets who arrived from across the Atlantic Ocean, some of whom were giants who intermarried with the Cherokee nation. The author provides actual copies of a 1902 New York Times article and one from the New York Tribune dated 1897 about the discovery of giants' bones. There is a photo of the Grave Creek Burial Mound in 1830s where a tablet was found which had letters that appeared to be Phoenician along with very large bones of humans. Another amazing topic woven into  the story is the initiation ceremony of the Freemasons which dates back to the times of Solomon and used to be called the ""Oath to Nimrod"" who was King of Babylonia over 4,000 years ago ( ~2000 B.C.) however although the same oath is still used today, Nimrod's name was dropped  for historical reasons which are explained in the book. This is one magnificent outstanding book!  Disclosure Statement: Reviewer received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

"James Hider has written an original, thought-provoking, adventurous, and entertaining novel that incorporates concepts from religion, psychology, anthropology, genetics, computer science technology and modern common culture (sometimes in a serious, other times amusing manner) to create a futuristic world where there are conflicts between different segments of society. This is a multi-layered book which can be read on a variety of levels and still be fully appreciated. It can be read as a story about the survival of an individual who is unique and faces choices we can not fathom due the new society which evolved. No one can anticipate or guess the next event, challenge or clash with society on his path in life because the world in which he lives is very different from ours.On a deeper level, the the book can be viewed as one man's journey on a search for the meaning of life, providing some answers to what society and life would be like if the soul, mind, personality survived after the body died. Regardless of what depth or layer the reader chooses to ascribe to the novel, it is a very satisfying reading experience. In this new futuristic world, values collide because various classes or segments of society possess different inner drives, desires or abilties to live which affects how they will die.There is a myth or legend which talks about the ""Missing Link"" a type of human who has survived a very long life but does not quite fit the definition of the usual classes of human genus/species of that era. This book is his life story which is definitely worth reading! The novel is genuinely imaginative and takes a fresh look at the human experience from a totally unique perspective.

"The revelations within the type-written manuscript of the book titled ""The Accident"" sent to literary agent Isabel Reed would destroy the global multimedia billion dollar corporation built by Charles Wolfe. It could also put the lives of anyone associated with its publication into serious jeopardy. One distinct problem associated with the book is its authorship, attributed to ""anonymous"", which is totally understandable given the content but without some corroborating evidence or eye witness accounts, would it be believable? The author understands the consequences of publication since he clearly states in the Epilogue, ""Because if what you are reading is a published book, printed, and bound and distributed into the world, I am, almost certainly dead."" The controversy surrounding the revelations alone would sell books but it would also destroy lives and careers. Isabel twice attempted to contact the author via the email on the cover page but the message she sent had bounced back twice. She realizes the book would be the hottest best seller, something any publisher would die for, but the real question is, does one literally want to risk dying - for the opportunity to publish it? The jealousies, competitive nature and potential triumphant successes of the publication industry make it a hot bed of secrets which are promised to be concealed but end up revealed in whispers under the strictest confidentiality.The title of the book alludes to an event that was hushed up, covered up between all participants and witnesses but which clearly points the finger of blame in one direction: Charles Wolfe. Essentially, those who knew what happened remained silent: the dead victim's silence was guaranteed, another key witness was kept quiet with payments that lasted many years. He became a well placed, highly paid executive within the corporation, in far too deep to run around and give it all up. The third witness to ""the accident"" was allowed to leave the scene and remained at large. Only this one person remained who could verify, corroborate the details.The author's talent lies in the ability to create suspense, drama, and tension by holding the reader's attention as he takes them down meandering paths of escape from the enemy. Key players rise to the occasion in Copenhagen, Zurich Switzerland and the Alps, the Hamptons in New York and Los Angeles, California. Disparate people, places, and past events are tied into a cohesive whole as the plot is developed and the unknown details are gradually exposed and come into focus. As one would expect, the Wolfe pack will do anything to protect their leader and to the reader's great satisfaction, an unexpected bombshell explodes with even more unexpected consequences that can not be anticipated. This is one fantastic, elegantly written novel that is truly ""impossible to put down.""

"Dimitri Orlov, a former KGB operative, and most recently a former employee of a Russian mafia gangster has serious ambitions to become the second in command of Russia. To accomplish this most lofty goal, he must convince the most powerful man in Russia, President Kuznov to put his stamp of approval on this mission. Gaining access to President Kuznov is nearly impossible through normal channels due to multiple layers of bureaucracy and  because of a cadre of armed guards always surrounding or near him. However, on his fifth attempt Orlov overheard Kuznov's secretary talking about the President's plans to travel to his country home for a weekend holiday. This provided Orlov an unofficial channel of access, a dangerous one which involved great risks, event possibly sacrificing his life if he failed. Orlov successfuly penetrated through the barriers to talk with the President.When President Kuznov heard the plans, he was hooked: the goal of making Russia once more a formidable super power was too difficult to resist,. It was a 'win-win' situation with little or no risk to himself. The President had plausible deniability should Orlov fail.  Orlov would broker a deal with Communist China to become allies with Russia. Orlov had inside knowledge about the highly volatile political climate within China. General Zhou a Maoist  style hard-liner  was exiled in Paris, planned to return and set events in motion to become President of China.  Zhou would ensure the current  President Li would die of a heart attack during bowel surgery for cancer.  President Li suspected he would be the fatal victim of foul play, untraceable and his death attributed to natural causes. He spoke with Mei Ling, the most powerful female within China, who was a member of the Politburo and on the Foreign Policy Advisory Committee. He told her, she would have the backing of highly placed members of China's Communist Party to be his successor, if he did not survive surgery.After this point, the author provides the reader a number of simultaneous events to ponder: the death of President Li as predicted and  the return of General Zhou who becomes the next President with the military's backing, plus due to teh bribes his brother, a wealthy industrialist had spread around to key Communist officials. Mei Ling secretly escapes to Paris. However, prior to President Li's unfortunate demise: Craig Page the European Union's Director of Counter Terrorism had made an unsuccessful attempt on General Zhou's life. Androshka, Dimitri Orlov's sister is President Zhou's mistress, she sets up a  meeting between her brother and President Zhou to discuss their mutually beneficial relationship, an alliance against the United States. As expected, President Zhou has a condition which must be met before agreeing to this mutually beneficial relationship. Orlov must murder President Dalton of the United States. It is a complicated and daring mission which Orlov pulls off  amazingly well and a few hitches. Afterwards, Craig Page is named CIA Director by President Treadwell, who succeeded Dalton. Zhou is furious that Craig Page, his sworn enemy again has such an influential and very threatening position.  Zhou provides the final obstacle for Orlov to overcome before officially engaging in a political alliance with Russia: obtain the detailed plans for PGS (Prompt Global Strike). It is  a highly classified and dangerous weapon created by the United States which has the capability of striking from within the US, any target in any country around the world, Whoever owns the plans and builds the weapon essentially rules the world. The game is on and the stakes are high. The book is most outstanding due to topic/ subject matter, writing style of the author, and  the pure reading pleasure derived from the unexpected twists and turns contained within.

"Adam Pelzman has written a deeply moving and emotionally satisfying story about the complexities and multiple layers of love which few authors would dare to tackle and at which even fewer would succeed. The author transforms the personal tragedies as experienced by Julian Pravdin in his early years when an orphan in Russia into protective instincts toward women and a business acumen which results in his becoming an enormously rich man. After attending a party, Julian and his beautiful wife Sophie discuss transportation home. Julian feels buzzed from drinking and wants to walk home, as the party was held several blocks from where they live in New York. Sophie is tired and does not want to walk, despite the full moon and ideal weather, she presuades Julian to drive. Acquiescing to his wife's request, Julian drives them but not before uttering a sentence as a joke which will haunt him for the rest of his life. An accident occurred as Julian swerved the car to avoid hitting a deer. Both passengers survived but only one of them sustained permanent irreversible injuries.While on a business trip to Miami, Julian uncharacteristically stops in a strip club and meets Perla a twenty three year old stripper of Cuban ancestry. What attracts him to her is, she does not look like the average stripper nor does she behave like one. Despite misgivings, Julian and Perla hook up at his hotel after her performance. For six months they maintain this arrangement, whenever Julian is in town. Unexpectedly, Perla is visited by a good friend of Julian's who extends to her an invitation to visit Julian and his wife in New York, complete with a paid airline ticket and expense money. Perla had only recently learned Julian was married, while she had no illusions of marrying him neither did she expect this invitation. Needless to say the story gets far more interesting after this point. The author introduces realistic sounding elements, graphic details, unusual events and activities which no reader can anticipate or guess. The sensitivity with which the author treats Sophie's delicate situation and personal needs is astonishing and totally unexpected. It surprises me that the author is a man, given the empathy displayed by the surprising events described in the book. While this book is not for everyone, I highly recommend it for those who are open to reading about tragic events with unexpected positive outcomes.

"Wilbur Smith has written a highly engaging novel filled with intrigues and plots within and outside the borders of ancient Egypt. The author includes adventure, romance, and most important of all strategic alliances related to marriage, politics and war. The story is told in the voice of Lord Taita, who had been a slave long ago but had risen to chief adviser to the Pharoah along with chief protector of his harem and most trusted ally to the two younger sisters of Pharoah, he had been made a eunuch in adulthood. His intelligence, cunning, humor and rise to power are astonishing. Lord Taita provides the reader insights into his past life and current achievements with tangential explanations as asides to the main story. Lord Taita arranged and staged an invasion of Hyksos, a separate nation which had once been part of Egypt but was lost in war. The invasion of Hyksos resulted in a bloody battle in which the Egyptians successfully killed their King and confiscated three large Minoan ships laden with silver  that had docked in a hidden area of Hyksos. Lord Taita's triumph was due to creating an illusion that the Minoan ships were invaded by Hyksosian soldiers (Egyptian soldiers in disguise) which resulted in war between Hyksos and Crete, who had been allies until then. The three ships left Hyksos unscathed, as the Egyptians again alluded detection by wearing the clothes of Crete when sailing through Hyksos. The Pharoah was highly pleased with Lord Taita's stealthy and successful invasion of Hyksos and the immense loads of silver he took as the winner.The illusions created by Lord Taita paved the way for Egypt to become allies with Crete and forge a more lasting alliance through marriage. The author includes an epic journey across the desert to reach a port from which Lord Taita, the Princesses, a large entourage, and high ranking Eygyptian soldiers accompanying them for protection, could sail to Crete. On this journey, one of the Egyptian princesses falls in love with a high ranking but nonroyal soldier, plus she is kidnapped by a desert bandit known as the ""Jackal"" and is eventually saved. Wilbur Smith proves his story telling capabilities in this book by taking the reader to the land of Ur, the palace of Marduk in Babylon. where ancient myths and stories come alive. It is however in Crete, the final destination of the Egyptian royal princesses, that the twists and turns within this novel escalate with an unexpected surprise ending involving a special ceremony held by the Supreme Minos (as their king is called) for his virginal brides. It is where the gods of Egypt and the magical ceremony presided over by the Supreme Minos clash - one must read the book to see which one prevails and survives. Wilbur Smith captures the reader's imagination with ancient kingdoms, unforgettable characters, astonishing plots and inner court intrigues, tactical battles, and magical ceremonies sprinkled throughout with wit and humor.

"If you are looking for adventure, romance, conspiracy, drama and historical realism- look no further - this book will meet and most likely exceed your expectations! The title ""Cossacks in Paris"" sounds like a novel about war and while there are some descriptions of clashes in battle and some fighting scenes, the book focuses primarily on relationships between individuals and nations, survival, and narrow escapes. The relationships are between nations and leaders of nations: Napoleon vs Tsar Alexander of Russia, along with Prime Minister Metternich an intermediary from Austria who makes several appearances. Amidst the unavoidable war which ensues, a romance develops and evolves between Kaarina daughter of  Count Gustav Armfelt of Finland and a French engineer Breutier Armande. Another one-sided romance arises between her twin sister Kasia and Major Agripin, leader of the Cossacks,  who is later promoted to Colonel during a successful battle. The Tsar promises Kaarina to Agripin in marriage, just after she demonstrated and proved her love to the French engineer. Agripin falls under the spell of Kaarina's sharp mind and astonishing beauty, and realizes where her true feelings lie: the French engineer, yet he wants to win her over and struggles with his strong desires, despite her resistance. He resists brutalizing her with Cossack rough behavior in the matters of love, yet he wants her very badly. How long he can hold out before his desires overpower his reason, only time will tell. The Tsar undoubtedly seeks to to seal the loyalty of the Cossacks to Russia, with this most unusual gift. This creates the enmity between Breutier Armande and Agripin around which much of the plot and events in the story are based. The main characters are so well developed and possess such outstanding personality traits, the reader is glued to each page, wanting to know how they will react to each tension, conflict, separation, and unexpected dramatic twist and turn in the plot.The plot is complex and dense, indicating the author's ability to weave historical figures and imaginary characters into a most adventurous and action-packed plot which takes the reader to such amazing places as Finland, St Petersburg and Moscow in Russia; the Steppes of the Ukraine; Pressburg, Hungary in the Carpathian Mountains; Leipzig, Germany; Zurich, Switzerland; and Paris, France. There are many extraordinairy and, unexpected transitions in the plot making it a joy to read and astonishingly, the Cossacks* do* enter Paris --  they threaten to explode the underground sewers to spread death, destruction and disease among the populace, as one would expect, they were not successful! It is quite amusing and amazing how a Rabbi from the Yeshiva in Pressburg provides help to Breutier Armande and Kaarina and later how a Yeshiva student named dn assists Breutier Armande to save Paris and most importantly the two women they love!

"What I love most about this product is that there are four varieties of  tea flavors in a package of 20 total. The consumer has choices based on mood, desire and taste preferences. One is not stuck with 20 tea bags of any one flavor wondering if the bags will expire before you get around to drinking them all. The liklihood is you will drink the variety pack much sooner and derive pleasure and enjoyment by having more choices.The ""pomegranate raspberry"" flavored tea also has rosehips and hibiscus added which provides a fine balance between fruit and floral flavors creating an overall sense of well being when drinking this tea. The ""orange cinnamon spiced"" tea has an unexpected burst of flavor which is a great ""pick me up""  during mid-afternoon when a person usually looks forward to an energy boost. ""Pure camomile"" tea has a soothing effect that promises serenity and calmness. ""Nightly calm""  is a surprising combination of camomile, spearmint, lemon grass, with linden, orange blossom, lemon myrtle, rosebuds, and hawthorne berries that is sure to help one relax, sleep and have pleasant dreams. This product by the famous Twinings Tea Company of London is most highly recommended.

"Yvette Manessis Corporon has written a charming and engaging human interest story which will appeal to those who love romance, the mystery of the Greek islands, strengthening family bonds and historical realism. The reader is introduced to the island of Erikousa where time stood still, many people live a traditional lifestyle where other than tourism, the main industry is fishing. Daphne is in her early thirties and will be married on Erikousa to her fianc Stephenwho is to be her second husband, a wealthy and successful banking executive. Daphne has arrived on the island and is met by her cousin, Popi who is close to her age and was her best friend, the last time she visited. Daphne's bonds of love to Yia Yia her grandmother were always strong, yet had not seen her for about six years. Despite physical distance, her grandmother always seemed to know and telephone just when Daphne needed her help and emotional support the most. Daphne's family roots are firmly planted in the region - her parents emigrated from here to build a successful life in America. They wanted to provide their only daughter new opportunities and a better lifestyle than possible in this remote area. When attending college in New York, Daphne fell in love with Alex during his oral presentation in class about his insights into the meaning of Christopher Marlowe's famous novel Dr. Faust. Daphne and Alex made eye contact, he discovered she was among the few who understood his interpretation of the book. He sat down next to her and the rest is history. They married after he wore down her parents objections to their only daughter dating a non-Greek. They had a baby daughter whom they named after her grandmother and enjoyed a happy life until he died in an unforeseeable accident. With great difficulty, Daphne summoned courage to carry on for the sake of their daughter Evie. She worked eighteeen hour days after obtaining a bank loan, to open her own Greek restaurant named Koukla. Stephen had influenced the loan on her behalf and became a regular patron at her very popular and successful restaurant. He was fascinated by Daphne with whom he fell in love and also by the great food at Koukla. Over his reservations, Daphne convinced him to be married on the Greek island of Erikousa so she could be surrounded by family. Also, Daphne wanted her daughter Evie to understand and feel the magic of this special place which Daphne loved so much.In this book the author explores complex family and personal relationships amidst unexpected tragedies and problems which arise in life. She shows how a single mother must balance and divide her time between building a successful business and still spend time with her daughter whom she loves deeply and for whom she is doing it all. Daphne had to deal with the pain and grief associated with the death of her first husband and also with that of another tragedy which took the lives of her parents. She built a successful business and became engaged, never expecting to be married again. After arriving on Erikousa, Daphne began exploring the source of her conflicting emotions regarding her pressured New York lifestyle and started appreciating the laid back cycle of life on the island. She noticed a change in Evie, who was a shy reticent child in New York but a more outgoing energetic child in Erikousa. One of the biggest challenges Daphne faced was meeting Yianni, a handsome rugged fisherman who was good friends with Yia Yia. He made observations about modern life, especially New York and conventional success which made her bristle and question her feelings, emotions and decisions even more. He seemed to know a personal secret related to her Yia Yia and her past that even Daphne did not know. The more Daphne learned about Yianni, the more of an enigma he seemd to be. Yet, despite her misgivings, Yia Yia trusted him completely and Daphne knew there was much she had to learn about their relationship and family history. The manner in which the story unfolds is extraordinairy and realistic. The author builds suspense and drama and romance in unexpected ways but the ending is not at all what one would expect. It is a beautifully told story which will appeal to those who love to explore deep emotions and family relationships.

"Jam packed with detailed information, Paul Collins reveals the enigmatic nature of Edgar Allen Poe by describing the complex, contorted and problematic events in his life. Yet, despite the difficulties of his life, it is from this unusual mixture that Edgar Allen Poe's imagination grew and from which his genius arose. As a novelist, poet, and artist of the highest order, he confounded his detractors and elevated his status in the eyes of his admirers. His genuine authentic stories have stood the test of time and Poe has earned the titles, ""the father of the detective fiction"" and ""master of horror fiction"". This biography sheds much light on the life of Poe, the complexities of his early life, young adulthood and early demise at the age of forty. It shows how Poe had overcome many hardships and built a success of his life despite having been dealt a very bad hand of cards.The author begins his biography by describing a mysterious ritual or tradition enacted for several decades at the gravesite of Edgar Allen Poe in Baltimore, MD, it ended in 2009. Someone dresssed in black, wearing a hat and scarf, would have a toast near the grave,on Edgar Allen Poes birthday. The mysterious stranger would leave three roses and a bottle of cognac there. It was believed the orginator of the tradition had died long ago and others had anonymously taken up the ritual by imitation and then finally it was abandoned altogether. As Paul Collins stated, it is likely Edgar Allen Poe would have approved of such an event.

"Matteo Pistono has written a very comprehensive and revealing biography of the Tibetan Mystic Terton Sogyal, who was of the Nyingma Buddhist tradition and lived during the end of the 19th century and turn of the 20th century. He was an advisor to the 13th Dalai Lama during perilous times when Tibet was threatened by war on two fronts, from the east as well as the west. Chinese invasion was a looming possibility due to Tibet's proximity to Mongolia, Tsarist Russia was seeking new territory to rule and the British were building more colonies in the Far East, with designs on Tibet, India, a neighbor to Tibet had already succombed. Terton Sogyal arose out of obscurity into becoming an important spiritual leader who was unassailable as demonstrated by his committment to Buddha's teaching and his one-minded pursuit of peace amidst the changing political landscape surrounding Tibet from outside as well as within the perimeter of her borders. Written on a linear time line, the author makes unfamiliar topics and concepts come alive, providing new territory to explore within each chapter, like revealing a mystery.This book is written on three levels, none of which can be separated. The first level includes the life and experiences of the man, named Sonam Gyalpol. The second level includes time and history, an important transitional era for the country of Tibet and the third level revolves around the spiritual practice and experiences of Terton Sogyal, the Buddhist mystic and spiritual leader. The author has a Master's degree in Buddhist philosophy from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. From the late 1990s to 2008, he travelled to Tibet for one to three months at a time, visiting nearly every location and pilgramage site where Terton Sogyal lived, taught, and travelled. The author studied the mystical visions and revelations of Terton Sogyal, he read many authentic sources, and researched historical documents related to this spiritual leader. One book in particular, ""The Marvelous Garden of White Lotuses"" is refered to as the only known biography of Terton Sogyal based on mystical prophecies about him by Padmasambhava (the Indian guru who brought the teachings of Buddhism to Tibet in the 8th century) and other saintly persons.This book is a journey which reveals many experiences associated with one of Tibet's most highly revered spiritual leaders and mystics. It is insightful and educational on all three levels of the contents of this book. The book contains translated Buddhist teachings, predictions, and poems along with historical events and mysterious discoveries which shed greater understanding on the main points about the life of Terton Sogyal. The book is easy to read because despite many unfamiliar concepts it posseses a rhythmical cadence and is told in a manner which builds intrigue and drama. Some events within the life of Terton Sogyal stretch into areas which feel more like myth or imagination than truth but this does not detract from the enjoyment of the book.

"This book will keep the reader intrigued and turning every page as fast as the information is absorbed, seeking answers to these puzzling questions, where was Clonmac Bridge's exact location in Ireland, who built it and why did it disappear. Jeffrey Perren has written  a highly enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining , edge-of-your-seat suspense filled mystery that includes romance, murder, and ancient secrets. Discovering the answers, the reader will be astonished and amazed at the deep and winding maze of fierce, jealous competition which exists within the Anthropology Department at the University of Virginia. The ultimate goal is to publish research related to newly discovered archealogy findings in a peer reviewed journal and thus make a name for one's self, gaining more grant money from available sources to continue working in this exciting field. Researching and uncovering monuments, buildings and artifacts related to ancient cultures is an intoxicating and perilous journey as one will discover when reading this book.Dr. Griffiin Clonmac was reading an ancient text in the Special Archives at the University library to uncover references about his latest research, Clonmac's Bridge in Ireland located somewhere along the Shannon River, when he noticed a colleague and rival, Dr. Daley remove an irreplaceable book from the library. Griffin was hooked on uncovering this mysterious anamoly, a bridge built in Ireland in the 9th century, over 1200 years ago. He knew the stolen book was relevant to his research. He did what anyone with protective instincts would do, he snuck into Dr. Daley's office to read the book for himself. This suppressed conflict between colleagues grows exponentially with convoluted, complex layers that promise the reader a fantastic ride into the past as well as into dark secrets related to the the building of the bridge and later its abandonment.The author enhances the plot by deftly weaving several cultures into his book, ancient and modern Irish, modern American both within a University setting and related to corporate business dealings, and also South American, specifically Peruvian. Dr. Mari Quirpe a knowledgeable and expert archaelogist, loses her job in Peru when her assistant dies in an unforeseeable accident on a dig. Her father is a highly placed government official within the Ministry of the Interior who *could* help her obtain a university teaching post in her chosen field but she refuses his help. She is stubbornly independent and knows she would have to make a deal, compromise her principles and marry someone of his choice as the custom. Through a twist of fate, Mari learns of Dr. Griffin Clonmac's research and is selected to work on his project in Ireland. Not unexpectedly, they develop a close bond both professionally and in their personal lives. However, each faces romantic temptations as new situations arise related to the project. This surprise development keeps the reader enthralled, wanting to know *both* the outcome of the archaelogical expedition related to Clonmac's Bridge as well as their personal lives. It is ultimately clear, someone or some group is out to sabatoge the research expediton and its discoveries. In this book, Jeffrey Perren connects the dots from the past to the present in an astonishing and satisfying manner, providing the reader a roller coaster of a ride right to the very end.

"Italy is a vacation/holiday destination high on most people's wish lists! This book will definitely help the discerning visitor choose the best places to visit among the top 6 regions of Italy: Rome and the Vatican;Milan, the Lakes and Piedmont; Venice, Veneto and Bologna; Florence, Tuscany and Umbria; Naples, Pompeii, and Amalfi Coast, and Sicilly and Southern Italy. As with most Lonely Planet guides, the book is color coded to each region making it easy to navigate and find whatever interests the reader. The book provides descriptions and photos of 25 highlights or must see cities, locations and sights which are also labelled on a handy map, helping the reader keep proper perspective and determine how realistic it would be to travel to each destination within the timeframe of their vacation. There are helpful sections with travel tips, methods of travel, accommodations, regulations and customs  This book selects *most* of what a visitor would love to see and provides a list of hotels and restaurants within each region that fits within moderate to high end budgets. Descriptions are given of where to locate public transportation, such as bus and train terminals and the metro and how to travel from one important location to another, which is very important for tourists who are unlikely to rent a car and drive around in Italy.However, as the saying goes, ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" because the cover itself would not entice me to buy this travel book. The background color on the cover, a dark lime green is not attractive. Florence is a great destination but the cover photo, the red roof of the Doumo (cathedral) one of the city's most iconic landmarks just does not do this book justice. There are numerous beautiful photos within this book which would have better served as cover of unforgettable places: numerous historical locations within Rome, various piazzas and fountains; Naples and Pompeii, the Amalfi coast, and the rolling hillsides of Tuscany with vineyards, castles, mansions and farmhouses and breath taking landscapes. Also it was disappointing that Portofino, one of the most picturesque and famous Italian ports was not mentioned in this book. Lastly, although agriturism was mentioned as an option, the book lacked information on the subject nor did it provide an internet link . For these reasons I deduct one star.

"In this book the reader learns much. Boris Pasternak was a man of vision, courage, and uncompromising principles. He was a human being with strengths and weaknesses but most important of all he was a man with a Russian soul. After going through official channels trying to get his novel, Dr. Zhivago, published in the Soviet Union, and meeting with resistance and outright hostility, he stopped his efforts. Instead, he allowed the manuscript, of what he regarded as his life's best work, to be taken secretly out of Russia to be published by a new Italian firm in Milan, owned by Giangiacomo Fetrinelli, an Italian Communist Party loyalist. The authors provide a vast amount of well researched, highly detailed information to help the reader understand Boris Pasternak's personality, education, family background, complicated love life (outside his marriage) and his relationship to the Union of Soviet Writers as well to its most prominent members and last but not least to various authorities. Astonishingly, Boris Pasternak had met with Trotsky in the early 1920s when the leader was trying to understand Pasternak's published work and determine where the author stood in relation to political matters. A few years later Lenin died and a power struggle ensued from which Stalin emerged as the victor. Stalin seems to have developed a grudging admiration for Pasternak's verse and writing. In the early 1930s, Mandelstam a friend of Pasternak had been arrested for writing and reciting poetry critical of the Soviet system. Stalin had telephoned Pasternak about the matter, asking why he had not petitioned to help his friend through the writer's organization. Pasternak's response to this question exemplified his uncanny ability to make a point without direct confrontation or abject criticism.Throughout the book the authors provide comprehensive chapters filled with detailed information which shed light on Boris Pasternak's personal views which changed over time. Most fascinating to read are his relationships with Soviet authorities, the ideological battles within the system and his surprising ability to survive. They describe many examples of his disenchantment with the Communist system and final frustration with censorship and outright official rejection of his writing which occurred later in life. Most enlightening is how copies of Pasternak's novel got secretly published by the CIA and clandestinely distributed at the World's Fair in Brussels in 1958. The hostile reaction by Soviet authorities when Boris Pasternak was selected as winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1958 was unprecedented and very well covered in this book. Sadly, in order to remain living in the USSR, for his own survival and that of his family, Boris Pasternak voluntarily renounced this coveted prize in a letter addressed to Nikita Khruschev. The publication of Dr. Zhivago in the West and the book's popularity worldwide remained one of the worst embarrassments for the Soviet Union. The Cold War was intensely fought on a literary battlefield between two opposing ideologies. Most shocking of all, was Khruschev's documented admission, that during the height of the political battles over the publication of Dr. Zhivago he had not read the book but later during his retirement after reading it, he concluded, ""We should not have banned it.""  Boris Pasternak fought valiantly and fortunately for lovers of great world literature, he did not fight in vain. This book provides a micro  and macro view of the Cold War as fought on a personal and global scale within a social, political and literary context seldom before revealed.

"Like most high caliber espionage agents George Quant prefers his cocktail shaken not stirred, that is he prefers his jobs loaded with excitement and adventure rather than mundane and ordinairy. In this most riveting and impressive novel, the protaganist, real name George Quant, alias Martin Matheson and also known as Agent Ai, is often shaken up from his adventures: his cover job is a journalist which takes him to Southeast Asia, to Russia where he obtains a Russian computer hacker's antiviral program which is the only known antidote against a planned global cyber attack, and his highly complicated associations with Hong Kong's richest businessmen, particularly Mr. Ho and Mr. de Haviland. As a journalist, spy, and double agent, his life is often endangered and threatened but under the most trying conditions he regains his composure and manages to escape, with the help of friends and accomplices. George was recruited as an agent on a trial basis by Amanda, a diplomat for Great Britain. Unexpectedly, he is embroiled in a romance with Amanda, who eventually becomes his handler under her real name, Karen. She procures for him life and death adventures which he could  not possibly have imagined when a student at Oxford University, from where he dropped out after failing a few courses.In a strange twist of fate in Russia, after his infiltration of Trusov Antimalware Corporation, where he obtained the only existing antiviral program against a global cyber threat, the Americans saved his life. George is forced to become a double agent. He is caught between the British and American sides, forced against his will,to share information with presumed allies, each of whom have secrets of their own. As Agent Ai, he is given a mission to learn as much as he can about Mrs. Zhao, the wife of a high ranking Communist Chinese government official. She has a flair for successful business transactions, an acumen for correctly assessing world market conditions which is highly unusual for a Communist official's wife. Under cover as Martin Matheson, Director of Lynbar Infrastructure Investments, Asia LLC, George meets Mrs. Zhao at a high end business party in Hong Kong hosted by Mr. Ho.  Needless to say, she is not who she seems but then neither are several other key players within George's circle of friends and acquaintances.This book is nonstop action, loaded with hair-pin turns and death-defying one hundred eighty degree drops. The author does an astonishing job of providing clues to an imminent world business disaster related to a new computer virus. The plot is thick and complicated and it is a total joy to read each page. The protaganist is a highly likeable adventure seeker, who is successful but not conceited nor overly ambitious, in fact, he does not even realize how good he really is. He is young enough to be daring and also to be surprised by his own abilities. His human fallabilities make the novel more interesting. The book is written in a nonlinear fashion which in some novels detracts from the reading experience but in this novel it has the opposite effect. The nonlinear approach provides insights and details about George's character, past and approach to life. It heightens the current dilemmas which he faces and enhances the enjoyment of the reading experience. Needless to say, the conclusion of the book is totally satisfying.

"Tom Doyle has written a credible, fascinating book providing insights into Paul McCartney's ""dark night of the soul"" experiences in the post-Beatles era. It describes the emotional peaks and valleys associated with a meteoric rise to stardom and fame which many would say just did not last long enough. In this book, the author describes what happened to Paul after the lights [on stage] went dim so-to-speak. We read about the struggles and difficulties Paul encountered in creating a rock band from scratch (eventually named ""Wings"") rather than the natural, organic process of the right people finding each other in an environment at the right time, which seemed to be the case with the rise of the Beatles. Especially interesting was how Paul came to meet and fall in love with Linda Eastman who at some point had said to him, ""I can make you a good home."" Paul's reliance on her as a wife, best friend, lover and eventually key board player in the band named ""Wings"" makes for fascinating reading. He credits Linda with helping him out of the darkest moments of his life.Tom Doyle does an excellent job of describing the circumstances associated with the lawsuit initiated by Paul related to the contractual agreements negotiated by Allen Klein, the agent who represented John, George and Ringo but who was distrusted by Paul. Paul felt better represented in business dealings by Lee and John Eastman, a lawyer team who were relatives of his wife, Linda McCartney (maiden name Eastman.) As the old story goes, ""the devil is in the details"" and the details were contained in a three foot high volume of documents that eventually revealed the monetary deals which were at the heart of the lawsuit. The lawsuit made sense to me and would perhaps make sense to anyone who earned a living/made money by working for it rather receiving an inheritance. The Beatles were sons/lads from working class roots who made it big on the world stage while they were in their early twenties. Their education and backgrounds could not prepare them to negotiate deals to handle the kind of money their fame brought into their lives. Money is a sensitive and emotional topic but hard questions required answers. Questions such as, ""What happened to all the money from multimillion dollar world wide record sales?"" ""Who got the money?"" ""Where did it go?""This book helps explain the musical phenomenon known as Paul McCartney from a multiangled lens camera. It contains descriptions of his lifestyle, personal views and choices, provides insights into his complex personality, and helps the reader better understand the unusual times in which changing musical tastes in the USA, Britain and worldwide shaped his life achievements. The author sheds light on the ""Paul is dead"" controversy and explores how it arose and became a media sensation for a time. Tom Doyle addresses the public rift with John Lennon and its effect on Paul. The book is based on interviews with Paul McCartney as well as with many of his close associates and musicians who were part of his inner circle. Especially interesting is the chapter which describes how the band Wings went on a ""road tour"" stopped in various University towns in England, to play before audiences on a seeming ""spur of the moment"" decision. The chapter which describes the genesis of the song, ""Give Irish Back to the Irish"" is also fascinating. Most intriguing are the chapters which dealt with Paul's continuing use of marijuana while on tour with the band resulting in an arrest in Sweden and a court case in Scotland. Yet it did not teach him the necessary lesson to curb this habit. It was in January 1980 that his laissez faire attitude caught up with him, when he unwittingly challenged the Japanese authorities by carrying marijuana into the country, in his luggage, and he was imprisoned. He finally heard the wake-up call that shook him back to reality. In summary, this book is most highly recommended because it is replete with insights, descriptions, and explanations of controversial topics associated with Beatles music and Paul McCartney.

"Peter Heller manages to achieve something few writers can: he captures the inner turmoil, thoughts and feelings of an artist, a painter. More than that he creates a portrait of Jim Stegner, a man who in doing the right thing for the right reason, embroils himself in unexpected consequences which lead him to become the prime suspect in not one but two murders. To complicate matters even further, he has become a famous artist, whose paintings can sell for as much as $20,000 each. They are sold by his dealer and good friend of over 20 years, Stephen Lilly who owns a very high end art gallery in Taos, New Mexico. We learn early on, his teenage daughter, with whom he shared a very close bond, died tragically and unexpectedly. The author keeps the reader glued to each page, as the heart and soul of this complicated artist is revealed. Much of the story revolves around the impact of his actions/ behavior along with his strong feelings related to two deaths. He descends down a steep and slippery slope from which there appears to be no escape. Fortunately for the reader, the author provides Jim Stegner, the artist and painter, a most astonishing, amazing and believable escape from what looks like a life-sentence-in-jail type predicament.The story is told in the first person, therefore the reader is given an insider's view of the artist himself, in his own words, he marvels where life has taken him: he shot a man, he became a father, and lived very far from the sea, in fact he bought a house in the desert from a writer. The author very deftly provides details about Jim's personal life, as memories and thoughts, which tie together seemingly incongruent, disparate events in his life. He is twice divorced, the first a love match which dissolved, the second was a rebound attraction after the first divorce. Women play a strong role in his life, the reader gradually learns about the close relationship Jim developed with his daughter Alce. After her death, he sunk into alcoholism and was rescued by Irmina, a fortune-teller, psychic, and spiritual female friend who essentially saved his life. He acknowledges he has faults. After surviving several of life's tragedies, Jim moved outside of Taos, three miles south of town, to paint. He found himself a nude model, Sofia, a young Latina, who is much younger than himself whom, to his astonishement is as greatly attracted to him as he is to her. She sticks by him, through thick and thin as the local deputy and sheriff question Jim about a local murder in which he is the prime suspect. As if one murder is not enough, Jim is connected to a second murder that is closely related to the first. Peter Heller manages to weave a complex story about the inner life and struggles of an artist and super imposes a fascinating murder mystery into the recipe which makes for one fo the most unusual and satisfying books I have read this year to date.

"I was very pleased to receive this Vine Review selection, a book written by one of China's most famous and best selling authors. Most pivotal and impressive is the fact that Mai Jai worked for the Chinese Intelligence Services which provided him the impetus to writing about breaking a secret code in global espionage. However, make no mistake about it, what is very clear and *most* evident is that the author's sophisticated imagination and highly admirable complex writing skills are the key to making this novel a sensational, exciting, and mysterious reading experience! Although undoubtedly, his personal and unique insights were enhanced by working in this unusual profession. It took me several readings over a few months to truly appreciate this brilliant and multifaceted jewel of a book.A gem when held to the light disperses a one-of-a-kind signature patterned reflection, such is the impression left on the reader after reading this book. There are layers upon layers of meaning and revelations concerning political, historical and cultural realities associated with various generations of the Rong family. Various political and historical changes resulted in a transformation of what defined success for this highly intelligent, industrious family, all of the family members managed to distinguish themselves in their respective fields of endeavor and profession over several generations.It started with Rong Zilai, also known as John Lillie, the first of the Rongs who broke away from the shipping trade which had been their main source of wealth and which defined their importance at the turn of the century. John Lillie became an academic, he started ""Lillie's Academy of Mathematics"" which later became the famous N University in Jiangnan, China. It all started due to his grandmother's poor health, he was sent to a University overseas to find her help but as time passed he studied more complex subjects such as math and geometry in which he excelled. After returning home, he opened his academy and amazingly over several generations, the family produced two children who became prodigies in mathematics. This book is the life story of one of these offspring: Rong Jinzhen, also called Zhendi, an autistic genius whose unmatchable skills were recognized and rewarded by his foreign math professor, Dr. Jan Liseiwicz. It is a fascinating read to discover how this professor ended up teaching at N University and the relationship which developed, blossomed and progressed between student and mentor. Later, it would play a central role in Zhendi's future profession as China's most talented and skilled cryptographer. The duo invented new rules in the game of chess, recalling this game of chess, Rong Jinzhen in the future would unravel the most difficult encoded messages in what became known as ""the Purple Code"". This is a most complex novel which is why I deduct one star but after getting used to the writing style, it is a highly satisfying and enjoyable book to read.

"Patrick Ness takes a Japanese myth which had great impact and meaning for him as a child then extrapolates aspects of it to build a mysterious story which crescendos into creating interest and intrigue for the reader who is hooked by the expectations of what is to happen, Unfortunately, the reader gets lost in the mystery which eventually grows into a quagmire of artistic expression that becomes a collage or kaleidoscope which threatens to overwhelm. Although the ending might come as a surprise to some, given the enigmatic nature of George Duncan's mysterious love interest, it came as no surprise to this reader. The truly serious disappointment was that the author could not decide upon a proper explanation for the explosive ending and therefore gives the reader five different possible scenarios that provide a reason for the ending. The fact he did not chose *just* one makes for a great let down. I reread the book, hoping to enjoy it more, looking for what I had missed but three stars is all I can honestly give to this book.Essentially, the main story is about George Duncan, a divorced print shop owner who is in his late forties. He has an adult daughter Amanda, also divorced, who is the mother of a bright and precocious young boy, Jean-Pierre or JP for short. The book begins whenGeorge hears a cry, a keening in his yard, which turns out to be a wounded bird, a crane that has an arrow stuck in its wing. George removes the arrow and saves the crane's life, setting the bird free. The story is told  poetically as if it were a metaphor for something about to happen, a mystery to be revealed in George's life, it is a very effective opening for a book.George is presented as a kind-hearted eccentric whom everyone trusts but whose personality is bland. Into his life enters Kumiko, a mysterious Japanese beauty who requests help with her artwork which consists of elaborate cuttings, that are enhanced  with feathers, creating a spell over those who view the pieces. Uncharacteristically, George falls in love with Kumiko and his life begins to be more meaningful and complicated. New aspects of George's personality are revealed as he and Kumiko continue to create more cuttings decorated with feathers. They become highly desirable and collectible art, that is sought by wealthy clients. George and Kumiko marry, to the surprise of most of George's closest friends and relatives. An unexpected disaster threatens their great love.Sorry to say that at times, I enjoyed reading more about Amanda and her emotional involvement with her ex-husband and his relationship with JP then the mysterious love which kept growing between George and Kumiko which held such great promise. Due to the ending of the book, the author could redeem himself with a sequel, where a relative or someone from Kumiko's past comes searching for her then the reader would at last be satisfied with the revelations about the past life of the mysterious Kumiko. Patrick Ness could also explore George Duncan's failed relationship with his first wife and provide plausible reasons for his reticent and bland personality, which could be the outward surface of a deeply complex emotional inner life. I would also love to read more about Amanda and her ex-husband Henri, why did their marriage not work out?

"Sherill Tippins has written an astonishing biography of the Chelsea Hotel, a memoir which the hotel itself would have written about the lives and accomplishments of its notable guests over the past 125 years, if (as the saying goes) ""the walls could talk."" In each chapter, the author provides a vast amount of information, impeccably researched about the artists, authors, would-be-published-authors, singers, musicians, playwrights, and other creative personalities who either met, rented or were residents of the Chelsea Hotel. What is most impressive is how the stories in each chapter flow from one era to the next in such a smooth and seamless manner. Every twenty to twenty five years, the next generation of creative personalities seems to awaken and newly discover the mysterious aura and milieu which attracts similar minded people to this location where they can thrive and produce some of their finest work.

"Shohreh Aghdashloo is an Emmy award winning actress and the first Iranian born actress to be nominated for an Academy Award who has made her home in Los Angeles, California. She was a well known actress in Iran starring in plays and films during her early thirties when the Shah of Iran ruled her country. She left her husband and family, fled her homeland to follow her passion for acting and escape the tyranny and terror associated with the Islamic religious government created by the Ayatollah Khomeini. As an outspoken actress, one who had strong personal political beliefs, a person who had attended rallies supporting the Shah's changes toward reform, she was at risk under the new regime. She had some connections in England where she settled, learned the English language, obtained her BA degree in Political Science and worked in retail and fashion, while pursuing her acting career. She ultimately fulfilled her lifelong ambition and dream: to become a Hollywood actress. In this memoir, the author shares her life story, which is filled with courage, ambition, love, hard work, political change and turmoil and overcoming the odds with a strong spirit that ultimately triumphs in the end.We learn of her first love and marriage to Aydin a highly cultured, European educated Iranian man who was liberal-minded enough, despite being twelve years older than she, to allow her to pursue her career of acting. He worked for the Ministry of Culture and Education, during the Shah's government. While the Shah ruled, Shohreh had a group of artistic and intellectual friends and traveled with her husband to Europe and Egypt. Her charmed life came to a halt and developed irreparable cracks after the Islamic Revolution. The concepts of freedom, artistic passion and women's rights eroded and were replaced by tyranny and fear. Some of Shohreh's friends were persecuted, imprisoned and a few even died. She feared arrest. Aydin's first loyalty was to his homeland, he loved Shohreh enough to release her from their marriage and gave her freedom to pursue her passion of acting and build a new life outside of Iran.The author describes a privileged early life in Iran, growing up with her three brothers, in a household where she was protected, cherished and provided a good education. She did not fulfill her father's dream that she become a medical doctor. During her teens, her independent spirit exerted itself, without her parent's consent, she modeled clothes in a fashion show and later starred in a play, which her parents would not attend. Despite her father's disapproval,Shohreh pursued her acting talent and became a well known and influential actress in Iran. Eventually, she won her father's support and acceptance of her chosen profession. Shohreh's move to the USA and Los Angeles is a moving story of challenges and triumphs of faith, hope, and hard work. Eventually she finds a new man, also an Iranian emigr, who fully shares her passion for acting, he is a playwright whose plays win standing ovations in Iranian immigrant communities throughout Europe and the United States. Their love story and marriage, is a fitting conclusion to this most interesting and timely, politically sensitive memoir.Although, I enjoyed this book, I deduct one star because the author's rendition of certain life events are too mildly and neutrally stated. It seems clear that Shohreh had great respect and love for her father but also had to follow her own life path, which meant conflict. She gave the facts but not the depth of emotions associated with these differences. Another example, the emotional depth and searing impact of leaving her first husband, the love of her life, is not well conveyed or explained. The author seems to avoid the feelings associated with the difficulties of starting a new life in England.  She tells us ""what happened"" but not the strength of the feelings associated with these life altering events. It is possible that these feelings are too strong and painful to explain in words and too personal to convey. I also understand the author is protecting the privacy of her relationship with her father and also that of her first husband. She wants to maintain the respect and integrity of their past relationship.

"This book is one great value, as it is really consists of five books in one. The entire book provides several years of lessons via a system that really works!  How do I know? I received this book in July from the Vine Program and in all honesty, would not review it until I actually put the lessons into practice. Now it is, three months later and I can write I have tested it and found I have fairly well retained the information which I learned from several chapters of Book One.What I like most about this system is that it uses a  common sense approach, they teach useable information right from the start. First you learn, words such as numbers and then phrases and tenses, which  when put together,  become actual sentences used in everyday situations. You have can listen to the correct pronunciation and practice pronouncing the word yourself because included is a CDrom which counts as one of the five-in-one books in the set.Popular expressions and idioms are fun to learn, since many are words in English which makes it easier, as the meanings are already known. There are sections in each chapter, called ""Talkin' the talk"" which provide actual conversations using the lessons learned. The reader can see and understand how the words are placed in sentence structure in real life situations. For example, two young girls meet and greet each other and discuss a work situation and about shopping, using words and phrases with which the reader has become familiar from the lessons.Overall, the lessons are based on daily life and real situations that you would encounter when visiting Germany. If you want a user friendly book with a common sense approach to learning and pronouncing words, phrases, and sentences, this book will help do it for most readers.

"Erika Chase brings readers the latest tale from the Ashton Corners Book Club, in her book, Law and Author. This is a great cozy series for readers who love the written word, as the author starts each chapter with a literary quote. It's a nice touch and it shows the care put into each part of the book. This one has a long lost granddaughter. A murder. Wedding Plans. Lots of personal tidbits about the heroine and her love interest and tons of things to keep the reader interested. Another great book in the series!What I liked:Erika Chase is a writer after my own heart. I love the quotes that precede each chapter of her books. It clues the reader in a little bit about what's to come and it shows Chases' love for literature. I find myself almost as interested to see what the quote will be as I am about what clues are going to come out in each chapter. I think that says a lot about how the author plots her stories and her influences. A great idea that a lot readers will appreciate.This book finds the Ashton Corners Book Club in a bit of a mess. Bob Miller, a club member, is being re-united with his grand-daughter, Darla. But not everything about her visit seems on the up and up and when murder comes calling, Darla has some 'splaining' to do. The premise of the book was interesting and I couldn't help but wonder, why all of the sudden this chick would appear. Bob having been estranged from his daughter for many years and never having met said grand-daughter before, was awfully trusting. Readers probably won't be too shocked when Darla turns out to be suspect in a murder. I liked the cat and mouse kind of play with Darla's story. It was like she couldn't tell the truth in spite of herself. Fun to read and ponder over for sure.Erika Chase always gives the reader a great mystery and this one was no exception. I found myself thinking about it when I wasn't reading. Trying to put the clues together in my head, right along with the characters. There was a moment when I considered the possible motive, but threw it out. So when the big reveal came it was one of those boink yourself on the head moments... LOL! The killer wasn't who I expected nor was Darla's story and motivation. It was a great surprise. Those are the best kind of mysteries aren't they?Lizzie and the book club members were once again on the trail of a killer, but we also got to see a lot of the wedding preparations going on. There were some great moments between Mark and Lizzie and it was nice to see their relationship blooming. They are a couple that never seems to grow stagnant. They are always changing and evolving. The way a great relationship should be. I liked the personal growth of the characters and the stories of the other book club members almost as much as the mystery. It's like visiting good friends with this series and I always love going back to it.What I Didn't Like:I felt like Bob and Molly were a little bit naive here. This could have been any girl, posing as Bob's long lost grand-daughter. It just seemed like they would have taken anyone in. It just didn't seem too plausible to me. I would have liked a little bit of skepticism about what she was up to and the like. Probably just a pet peeve of mine and certainly not a deal breaker.Bottom Line:This is another engaging book from Erika Chase. Not only do readers get a good mystery, but the personal moments of the story were also poignant and fulfilling. I wanted to hear more about Mark and Lizzie and I got that in this one. I wanted to learn more about other members of the book club and I got that too. Just an all around good addition to the series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZOL5HN1SH0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425278204#wasThisHelpful","R2IZOL5HN1SH0V","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jane Shoup brings readers the first book in her Green Valley series, Down in the Valley. This book is set in West Virginia during the 1800's. Readers who enjoy books with lots of characters and storylines will find this one right up their alley. Shoup is not only able to tell a compelling story of a woman who has suffered finding a place for herself and love, but she is able to enlighten the reader about the rights of women during this time in history. A heartwarming tale of second chances and helping others. Potentially, a very good series.What I Liked:I don't live too far from West Virginia and I tend to like historical novels that are set in that area. West Virginia and Kentucky have a lot in common, especially during the era that Down in the Valley depicts. I thought Shoup did a wonderful job of showing the ruggedness of the area and it's beauty. But she was also able to capture the sometimes forgotten picture of poverty and desperation. The town Shoup writes about was not destitute or anything like that, but there were a lot of people in need of a helping hand for one reason or another and I think that was a realistic portrayal of the times. Well done on that aspect of the book.I liked the fact that Shoup was able to shed some light on the rights of women during the 1800's. A woman alone trying to fend for herself was rare. It was difficult on many levels because the men had a great deal of power, while women did not even have the right to vote. Men were supposed to earn the money and provide for the women and turning the tables on those ideals was just not done. I liked the fact that Emeline was independent and strong, especially considering her past. I thought she was a great example of the human condition and I enjoyed watching her grow as a character in such a tough environment.Emeline's relationship with Tommy was quiet and tender and had the makings for a really solid love story. The idea that Tommy along with several other misfits, if you will, came to help Emeline on the farm, gave their romance a chance to bloom. I found Tommy to be a little on the shy side, but he held strong convictions and wasn't afraid to voice them when he needed to. I thought the main characters complimented each other well. Readers who are looking for a romance that is wholesome and sweet will certainly like these two together.What I Didn't Like:Although there were several things I did like about the book, there were many things that overshadowed the potential in this one. There were tons of characters in this book. Far too many to make it easy to follow. It created a lot of confusion and it was hard as a reader to figure out who was important to the story and who wasn't. It think it would have served the writer better to have had a smaller cast that could have been more thoroughly developed. I want to know more than just the name of a character who is being introduced. I want to know why I should care who they are. Why I should want to remember them as the story continues and I felt that was missing here.Errors in grammar are not one of those things that bug me. Spelling errors however, stick out like a sore thumb. There were some errors in both areas with this book but the most glaring issue for me was the terminology and modern language. This was a book set in the 1800's and I felt like Shoup took a lot of poetic license in how she expressed herself and how her characters talked and in some cases acted.Bottom Line:There is a lot of potential here. The plot itself was engaging and there were some ideas that were definitely worth pursuing. I liked the actual love story part of the book but felt it was somewhat confusing to sort it all out. Too many characters and a bit to much modern language. I think the author brought readers a compelling story, with a great heroine, but perhaps needed to reign in how many people the reader needed to keep up with. I will certainly give the next book in the series a nod and see how things progress. One to watch... it could be amazing given a few minor changes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K1MSIWR9MUB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420137093#wasThisHelpful","R3K1MSIWR9MUB2","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author of the Jane True series, Nicole Peeler, brings readers the first book in a new urban fantasy series. Jinn and Juice is the first book in the Jinni series and promises to turn what readers know about this author on it's ear. Having read a few books and seen a few Jinni's in movies and television over the years, I can say that readers are in for something different with this series. This Jinni doesn't blink her eyes and nod her head. A great new read from a well respected author in the genre!What I Liked:This book was totally refreshing. I loved the Jane True books, but I've got to say Lyla, the heroine in Jinn and Juice was really intriguing. I loved the whole Jinni premise of the series and couldn't wait to dive in and see what Nicole Peeler's take on this subject would be. Lyla the heroine is a very old Jinni. She has been under the curse for almost a thousand years and is on the verge of becoming human again. Unfortunately, she has to hide out until the coast is clear and her servitude is over. As luck would have it, she gets bound with only a week to go. That's when the action starts and it doesn't slow down for a second. Readers are hurled into a very new and different landscape. The world building here was intense and very full. Peeler really went out on a limb with this one and I think it pays off for the most part.I expected Lyla to be kind of wise beyond her years. The sage heroine who has been through a lot and ready to be completely unbound. Not exactly, what readers get with her character. She has a kind of 'devil may care' attitude. She's all about belly dancing and burlesque. She didn't come across as particularly worldly wise, but she was still a treat to read about. She liked to have fun and lets face it you need a character like that in most urban fantasy titles to lighten the mood a little bit. Peeler gives readers a Jinni with a penchant for adventure. Nice touch!I admit that I wanted to know more about Lyla. Her backstory was  a little vague, as was most of the other character's stories, but I think we can chalk that up to this being a series. I expect we will find out more and more as the series continues about her and that may be the best way. The way the world of the Jinni's and the Magi worked was interesting and full of surprises. The relationship between Lyla and Oz is captivating, but a little on the weird side, as she is basically his servant. But the dynamic between them nothing if not intriguing.What I Didn't Like:I really wanted to like this one and I did on a lot of levels, but my issues with it all stem from one thing. There were just toooooo many supernatural characters. You had just about every paranormal character you could possibly think of in this book and new ones that Peeler created herself. Too many names, too many descriptions. Way too much to try to keep up with. I could see the potential in having so many but I think it took too much away from the actual story. I think the back stories were vague on the characters partly because there were just too many in every possible way. Yes, it is possible to have too much of a good thing and I think that's what happened here. Doesn't mean it can't be fixed in subsequent books in the series.Bottom Line:This one needed a bit of work. I liked Lyla, but she was not what I expected. The Jinni premise was spot on, but there were so many other supernatural characters it all but got lost in the mix. I can see where Peeler was going with this and I hope she reigns it in a little with the next book because there is a lot of potential here. But you better be ready to take notes when you read this one if you want to keep'em all straight. Almost gave me a headache... LOL!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C59ZTZ0NUTEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316407356#wasThisHelpful","R1C59ZTZ0NUTEM","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Victoria Abbott returns with the latest book in the Book Collector Mystery series, The Marsh Madness. This mother, daughter writing team once again brings readers a book based on a highlighted mystery writer from the past. This time it is Ngaio Marsh. These books always have that nostalgic feel to them. It's a story like Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot would be involved in. Abbott doesn't disappoint. It's a page turner from the first to the last.What I Liked:This is a great series for me, because I cut my teeth so to speak, in the mystery genre on the books and stories of Agatha Christie and other greats. I love the fact that these authors focus on different writers from the past and try to educate the reader a little bit while also entertaining them. All of the details on book collecting also add a layer of authenticity to the stories. So, not only goes the writer get a great mystery but they also get an object lesson on some literary greats.Vera's collection is certainly growing under Jordan's guidance and adding a collection of mystery writer, Ngaio Marsh would be another feather in her cap. When Jordan, Vera and Uncle Kev go to check out a prospect they get a lot more than a few first additions. The seller, Chadwick Kauffman ends up dead... but wait a minute, it's not really Chadwick Kauffman at all. It looks like an imposter is a foot and Jordan and the gang or being framed. I loved the plot for this one and they way things all came together. I thought Abbott did a great job with the mystery aspects of the book and kept the reader off balance enough, so that they didn't figure it out too early. The mystery was interesting and elaborate. Liked it a lot.One of the strong things about this series has always been the great characters that Abbott has created. Jordan once again proves why she is such a great heroine for this series. She gets to the heart of matter with a lot of curiosity and some really good instincts. I love the way that she has such great love for good books too. She really is a very good character. Her relationship with Smiley is heating up a little bit too and it was nice to have that break in the action to pick up on Jordan's personal life.As always the secondary characters share the spotlight with Jordan. Uncle's Kev and Mick are right in the middle of the action and Vera is always a treat with her snarky attitude and ways. I think my favorite of the secondary characters is Signora Panetone and her amazing concoctions in the kitchen.Bottom Line:Another great book in this coy series about great books... LOL! I have liked all of the books in this series because of the intriguing plots and interesting characters. These authors prove that two heads are better than one when it comes to writing good mysteries... can't wait for the next one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDD9T0ES7OGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425280349#wasThisHelpful","R2SDD9T0ES7OGC","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Breakout is the series ender for The Dred Chronicles by Ann Aguirre and what a finish it was! Aguirre has created a spin-off series from her Sirantha Jax series, that may actually top the original, a rare feat. This is a science fiction series that has everything from bloody battles to tender love scenes and the sympathetic characters in the story, just happen to be a colony of murderers. Now, if that's not unique, I don't know what is! Fantastic ending to a great series.What I liked:When I first started doing a lot of reading on my own and picking titles that I wanted to read for myself, science fiction was one of my favorite genres. I don't even know why. I think I can see the parallel between reading paranormal fiction and reading science fiction. Aliens versus super natural beings like weres and vamps. But I have really gotten away from reading very much in the Sci-Fi genre. There was something about The Dred Chronicles that drew me in and helped me remember why I used to like it so much. The world building is phenomenal in these kinds of books.Ann Aguirre has created such a unique and different universe for this series. The Dred Chronicles actually centers around a penal colony full of murderers. What's more the reader is expected to like these characters, even love them to some extent. Talk about a hard premise to sell. But Aguirre makes it look like child's play. She draws the reader in with this whole idea of why these people are put in this position and what they hope to gain by getting out. She inspires a sympathy in the reader for them, before the reader even sees it coming. Amazingly done!This is not science fiction for the faint of heart though. Breakout has several very bloody battles and Aguirre does not spare the reader the gore involved. But what's interesting about that is that it seems so natural. Like there was no other way this could have gone differently. Being the final book in the series, a lot of things needed to happen to bring about resolution for those aboard the prison ship Perdition. I think each characters ending was well thought out, planned meticulously and brought to a conclusion that befitted their situations. Not everyone got a happy ending. It's just not that kind of book. But the loose ends were tied up and the conclusion was satisfying.We learned a lot more about Jael in this book than ever before. He started out in Aguirre's Sirantha Jax series, but he has really shined in the Dred Chronicles. Despite all of the mess everyone was going through and some of the gut wrenching scenes there was still time for a little romance. What could be more erotic or sensual to finding love when even you next few minutes were in jeopardy. I felt like Aguirre ended things in a more traditional way with this series. She gave resolution to the questions about Jael and what happened after and that was nice. I didn't want to make up my own ending this time and she didn't make me... it was amazing!What I Didn't Like:The pacing was a little odd at times. Certain things that happened in the story got only a few paragraphs of description and others several pages. I wanted the important things to get more time. I wanted to digest a little bit before moving on to some other soul crushing event. I think my emotions just didn't have time to catch up sometimes with this one. There were also parts that dragged a little bit, but once it all panned out, I can't really count that as a reason to give this book anything less than a 5 apple review.Bottom Line:If you like science fiction you can't miss this one. Breakout was amazing in just about every way. Lots of cool aliens, a ship full of murderers. Battles that will make your head spin and a universe that makes you wish this wasn't the last book in the series. I want more and I think you will too. You don't have to read the Sirantha Jax series to like this one, but you'll probably go back and read it once you figure out what a great author Aguirre is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NEGVLNP45IJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425258165#wasThisHelpful","R1NEGVLNP45IJI","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Double Vision is the second book in Colby Marshall's Dr. Jenna Ramey series, featuring a heroine with a unique trait for helping solve her cases. Marshall uses the ideas of color and numbers in a very unusual way in this mainstream mystery. Readers who are looking for an uncommon plot and strong characters will love this one. A massive shooting sets the stage for Jenna's latest case involving a six year old gifted child who witnesses a heinous crime. But Molly isn't your average little girl and it's up to Jenna to use Molly's gifts and her own to catch a killer. A very rare book with a fantastic premise!What I liked:Okay, so there were parts of this book that were very well written and parts that came across as a little too logical or too easy. But the overall theme of the series is quite unparalleled in most of the main stream mysteries I have read. Marshall gives her heroine Jenna a very rare neurological condition known as synesthesia, in which the patient's neurological pathways are so closely related that they are almost connected. Put simply, this heroine sees in color. Not like you and I do, but in a way that correlates her experiences and can be used to help in her job as an FBI profiler. This was fascinating and it's a real condition. Marshall does't bombard the reader with too much information about it, but she uses it in a way that makes this story something completely different than anything I've read before. Well done!I don't review too many main stream mysteries because I like a book that is a little less graphic. I don't necessarily like to read about all the guts and gore and thrillers tend to be quite dark in some cases. This book had that type of edge, but it didn't get too messy. Yes, there was a massive shooting in which seven people die, and it is related to another case where more people died, but it didn't give me any cringe worthy moments. I admit to wondering what possesses people to do this kind of thing more than once, but it was the kind of book that was worth reading even if it did deal with some really maniacal minds.Jenna and her boyfriend Yancy were both great characters that Marshall did a great job writing. Jenna has had to learn to see the world in a different way literally. In this book she has to take her way with colors and try to understand Molly's way with numbers. It was almost like they were speaking two different languages, but were able to find a way to fuse the two to find a killer. I like characters who are unusual in some way and Marshall certainly stimulated that avenue with Jenna's ability. Marshall was also about to show how it affected Jenna's personal life, as well as, her professional life. She was a great heroine and the addition of Yancy as her love interest gave readers a new way of seeing Jenna.What I Didn't Like:I seriously wanted to like Molly. And on some levels I did, but I couldn't get away from the idea that she was just too perfect. I know she was written as a gifted child, but she was still supposed to be a child. Even in children who have great intelligence you still have that essence that is still innocent. Molly wasn't like that. She didn't have that quality that made her still seem innocent and childlike. I wanted her to act like a kid, at least a little bit and I didn't get that with her. It seemed like something was missing. She didn't come across as legit, so to speak. Too poised, too adult like and too controlled.Bottom Line:There was a lot of potential here. The mystery itself was captivating. Jenna was an amazing heroine and the premise for the series was top notch. I think the author missed the mark a little bit with Molly's character but that didn't take too much away from my overall enjoyment of this book. Main stream mysteries are a little dark sometimes, but they make up for that with sheer realism and gut wrenching action. This was definitely a good one. If you like a good mystery, this one might be right up your alley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WXSCYYXHAGXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042527652X#wasThisHelpful","R1WXSCYYXHAGXJ","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shelley Freydont continues the Celebration Bay mystery series with her latest book, Trick or Deceit. Halloween is the perfect setting for murder! Readers who are looking for a great cozy for the fall season will love this one. With everything from haunted houses and witches to preachers and town skeletons in the closet, this book has it all. Freydont's trademark quirky characters and the small town setting give this one all the makings for one haunted read...What I liked:Halloween was always a favorite holiday of mine for more than one reason. Candy, candy and more candy, but more importantly getting to transform myself into a character from my favorite books. I took it seriously when it came to celebrating the season. I had a party once and even made my own graveyard with the names and funny epitaphs for my friends. So when I found out this cozy had a Halloween theme I was totally on board. Celebration Bay was the perfect place for this theme. This small town goes all out when it comes to holidays and I was excited to see how they decked out for the scariest of them all.The haunted house competition was a brilliant idea. I loved reading about the entries and how each person that entered interpreted it differently. The $10,000 prize certainly made things a little intense and somebody was a very sore loser. The mystery aspects of this one centered around the murder of one of the judges. Freydont gave readers plenty of suspects and the motive was pretty obvious, or was it? I thought the clues were plentiful and the red herrings were not too far out of the realm of possibility. Freydont did a great job with the Halloween theme and the murder mystery.Liv Montgomery, the heroine of the series and Celebration Bay's event coordinator is a perfect amateur sleuth. Celebration Bay is looking to get a grant to build a new community center and it's up to Liv to figure out the clues to this murder before a New York backer comes in. I liked that Liv is curious by nature but not necessarily foolhardy or reckless in her investigations. She is a pretty logical thinker and I like that about her. The other secondary characters in the book, add so much to each story. They are well written and always provide a different perspective on each mystery. Great characters all around.What I Didn't Like:There has been a lot of tension between Liv and Chaz for awhile now. They seem to be dragging their feet about whether or not they want to be a couple or not and that's getting a little frustrating, since this is Book 4 in the series. I want them to just pull the trigger so to speak, but that may just be a pet peeve of my own.Bottom Line:This was a good cozy for the season. Halloween is right around the corner and this one really hits the spot of those of us readers who like the creepy factor when it comes to murder. The mystery was believable and not to easy to figure out. The motive seems clear, but there are a lot of factors in this one. Liv is once again a great sleuth and seems to have settled into her role as event coordinator. She and Chaz need to figure it out though! LOL... A very good addition to the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TTLVZH81BLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425281477#wasThisHelpful","R13TTLVZH81BLG","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karen Hawkins brings readers the second book in the Princes of Oxenburg series, The Prince and I. Hawkins is a big name when it comes to historical romance and she never disappoints. This book is an interesting take on the ""Robin Hood"" story that features a female bandit and a warlord prince. Hawkins uses everything from comic relief to intense and almost instant romance to bring this one together and readers will be thrilled with it. A great addition to this wonderful series!What I Liked:First off, let me say that Karen Hawkins is in my opinion a very good historical romance writer. Everything I have ever read from her was unique and well written. I knew what to expect going into reading the Prince and I. Great characters, humor in spades and a plot that would be both entertaining and fun. I got all of that and more with this book. The book starts out fast and furious and doesn't slow down much. There was a slight lull in the middle somewhere, but it didn't matter. When it caught back up it was on fire. Such a great romance and the author's take on Robin Hood was exceptional.Lady Murian is one a mission. Her husband and her home have been taken from her and she's out to get a little revenge. I loved the fact that this book is set in the Highlands and that Murian takes to the ways of the highwayman to thwart her nemesis, the Earl of Loudan. What a unique take on Robin Hood. I loved it. A female bandit was such a great idea and it really worked here. Murian is strong and fiesty and full of vim and vigor. It would take kind of character to stand up to Prince Max. He is a warrior and Murian proves that she is as well when she bests him with her sword. One of my favorite female leads of the year.Max isn't your average prince. He doesn't sit at home and bemoan his daily drudgery of being a prince. He leads his men into battle and he sometimes ends up being the bearer of bad news. When readers meet him, he is in somewhat of a dark place, a little broody and in need of something to fight for. Murian gives him that and so much more. The attraction between them is for lack of a better word, instant. Max knows the Scottish Robin Hood is a woman and he's out to find her again. I liked that he was such a strong character. He had a great sense of duty and intelligence that went well with his handsome features. I liked him a lot, though instant love isn't necessarily my thing.Tata Natasha, Max's grandmother has gotten herself into a bit of a fix and needs her grandson's help to get her out of it. She was a saucy grandma as usual and provided a lot of comic relief for the book. Hawkins has such a great sense of humor and most importantly she is able to translate that into her books. It gives the reader a smile now and then and takes the pressure off of the lead characters long enough for readers to catch their breath. Great humor and comedy in this one.What I didn't like:Like I said, instant love isn't really my thing. Though Murian and Max fall for each other at first sight, there were still some obstacles in their way, so it didn't feel like they were automatically going to fall in love and marry. However, there was that cringey kind of feeling you get when love seems to be trite and predictable. I'm glad Hawkins was able to pull it out with these two and not fall to far into the instant love trap.Bottom Line:I loved this one. I want to read the first one now and the next one and the next one. Loved the humor and the strong characters. The pacing was for the most part, good and I loved Hawkins' take on Robin Hood. I want to throttle the Earl of Loudan and have tea with Tata Natasha. LOL... I was a great read! Lots of fun and lots of romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CSFWJRPG2A3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147678597X#wasThisHelpful","R2CSFWJRPG2A3R","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steve Bein's Fated Blades series, continues with Disciple of the Wind. This is really, really good Urban Fantasy. It combines a police procedural with mythology and Japanese history and also has a streak of magic in it, complete with mystical Japanese swords. Bein's lead character Mariko defies stereo-types and kicks some serious butt. Be it cop or rogue, she is one amazing heroine! Readers who enjoy urban fantasy will love it and if you're new to it, this is a good place to start.What I liked:I don't even know where to start with what I liked about this one, there is simply so much that I could talk about. First of all, I read a lot of urban fantasy, though that is not the prevailing theme of my blog, it is one of my favorite genres for personal reading. Urban fantasy is different from Paranormal Romance, because there is often no romance at all or very little. The focus is on the paranormal more so than romance. It is a lot about strong characters with magical influences, strong themes and tends to be a little darker and more edgy. Steve Bein's is a writer who understands those differences and uses them to his complete advantage.In Disciple of the Wind readers get a gritty, raw reading experience that takes things like magic and mythology and makes them more accessible and realistic than a book based on romance does. I quite frankly, haven't read too many urban fantasy titles that are based in the Japanese culture and I was completely sucked in by this one. I loved everything from the cover, to the blurb on the back. Bein uses a deft hand with his characters and he blends the past a present in a way that makes sense to me as a reader. It shows the importance of history and how that history can affect the present. Just an amazing use of historical background!Mariko is a heroine like few others I have ever read. She is driven, hot tempered and the wielder of a magical sword that would be the envy of any superhero. She has a strong sense of duty and what is right and wrong. Being a cop she has to deal with a lot of politics about what she can and can't do. Being a rogue she still has to worry about outside influences that can pollute her quest for justice. She was magical in every way. She kicked butt and took names all in the name of fighting terrorism in present day Japan. An amazingly written character that readers will not soon be able to forget.The parts of Mariko's story that deal with the imminent attack on Tokyo are largely written like a police procedural. Those can get a little boring at times in my opinion but not this one. I loved all of the discussion about the Wind and how their form of justice was different from Mariko's ideas. Good stuff! The action is fast paced and never lets up. But the reader gets a breather when the author goes back to the past with the quest of Diagoro and his mission to find the mystical sword. The Japanese history and legends that Bein tells the reader about give this book a feeling of being on a hero's journey. I am a big fan of history and legends and this part really sang to my soul. Very well written and with exceptional attention to detail. Everything worked so well together and past and present blurred in a sense. Great writing!Bottom Line:This was just a fantastic book! One of my favorites of the year in this genre. Can't say enough good things about it. Excellent characters, remarkable use of blending the past and present, an urgency that pervaded the book, but with sequences that slowed it down just enough. So much that I loved about this one. I didn't want this one to end, but the ending was so well crafted that I wanted to skip to the back just to experience it. How many books can you say that about? Wow! That's about the best way to sum it up. I want more, quickly...lol!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB06N1SWY721F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451470206#wasThisHelpful","RB06N1SWY721F","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cinderella Six Feet Under is the second book in Maia Chance's Fairy Tale Fatal mystery series. This series is very unique in a genre that is saturated with a lot of the same kinds of stories. Chance makes the reader take a look at fairy tales as though they are real. She uses historical background and context to bring the reader a mystery that is steeped in history and lore. Who didn't hear fairy tales when they were growing up? It's a perfect hook!What I liked:I liked just about everything in this book. First and foremost the premise of the series. Cinderella Six Feet Under takes up the mantle  of fairy tale truth following Snow White Red Handed. This book takes the fairy tale of Cinderella and interprets it in such a distinctive way. Readers have to suspend their belief in reality a bit for this series, because the characters and the world building of the series, assumes that fairy tales were real, not just stories or even legends, but real happenings that can be traced and followed. Gabriel, one of the main characters is a professor that is obsessed with fairy tales and proving their existence. It is just a rare and unusual premise. I love it!I have to admit that Cinderella was always one of those fairy tales that I felt was a little trite and predictable. The way Maia Chance tells it is totally different from the abused step daughter meeting her prince and it involves a murder... who knew! One of the things that stands out is the historical aspect of the story. It is set in 1867. I loved the references to Paris of the day and how the culture and prevailing thoughts of the times were incorporated into the story. Historical cozies are becoming really popular and I hope it is a trend that continues, but this book and series take it in a whole new direction.The re-occurring characters of Gabriel, Prue and Ophelia are back once again in this one. Gabriel, the professor, has this fascination with fairy tales and really his perspective is what makes the series work. I loved Prue and that this book had a lot to do with her and her family. She comes off as a bit of a blond at times but I found that kind of endearing in a way. Ophelia is the sensible one, the stubborn one, and the one that has the most trouble believing the significance of fairy tales. She was skeptical but open minded enough to see where the clues were leading. Loved all three of them in this book and found so much more about them that will probably be explored in future books.What I Didn't Like:The mystery was really clever. But there were a lot of characters to keep up with. A lot of big long names and a lot of references to the previous case these three worked on. It was on the confusing side. If you read Snow White Red Handed, that will help, but it doesn't completely alleviate the disorientation you might feel in the first few chapters of the book. It's one of those stories that may have been served better to have had less characters carrying the story.Bottom Line:There is so much potential for this series. I love the history, the mystery and the premise is out of this world. The light fantasy type feel to the book is fun for all of us readers who enjoy a bit of the paranormal, but it will still speak to those who don't want to go too far in that direction. This book has Cinderella like you've never seen her before and of course a murder and a victim that looks just like Prue. Not mention wicked step sister who won't let Prue in the house and a missing mother... oh my!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1956N659KGPPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425271633#wasThisHelpful","R1956N659KGPPS","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Blaine Lourd is a Los Angeles businessman. But his poignant new memoir, Born on the Bayou tells the story of a young boy growing up in ""Cajun"" country. This is a father-son tale that will make you smile, make you nostalgic and make you contemplate the relationships in your own life. Lourd is a born storyteller and his book is both raw and sentimental. Readers who love non-fiction and memoirs should not miss this one. It was amazingly detailed and full of sharp intellect and a true sense of family. Lourd proves that you might take the boy out of the Bayou but you never take the Bayou out of the boy!I read non-fiction on occasion and truly enjoy it. I have often found that true life experiences are sometimes more interesting than most fiction. Memoirs are a favorite of mine for a lot of reasons. I like the intimacy that the reader gets from the story. It's like being a part of that person's life for a little while. I like the realistic portrayals of hard times and good times. I like the honesty in it. And wow, did Blaine Lourd deliver with his new memoir, Born on the Bayou.This is such a good memoir. I found myself wondering things about when I wasn't reading it. Lourd has a wonderful voice for writing. His storytelling ability is memorable. I think this is one that will stick with readers for awhile. It is basically, a father-son story. Lourd tells about his life in Southern Louisiana and how it shaped him into the man he became. It has everything from hunting to chasing women and will draw the reader like bees to honey.Lourd grew up in the 70's during the oil boom and subsequent collapse in the early 80's. His father, known to many as ""Puffer"", was a trucker who taught his boys about becoming a man. It is a candid story that doesn't hesitate to show the good and the bad of this man's life and how his influence changed his sons for the better and the worse. I loved the admiration Lourd felt for his older brother and his acceptance of his fathers flaws. I found myself wanting to know more than even the memoir provided, a rare thing in non-fiction for me.This is also a rags to riches kind of story. Blaine Lourd didn't stay in the Bayou, but the Bayou never left him, even when he became a big shot in the big city. For one thing is shows the American Dream is still real and is still happening. There are those who still come up hard, but come up strong. Lourd's book exemplifies what hard work will get you and how you must never forget where you came from. The sense of family is strong in this book, the sense of tradition and a dying way of life. We may be becoming a more urban society as opposed to the rural society of the past, but is that good or bad?Bottom Line:This was an amazing story. I can't recommend it enough if you like this kind of reading. And if you don't and you're looking to broaden your horizons a bit, this is the memoir to do it with. Excellent, storytelling. A strong intellect and sheer raw honesty. It's a great read and I hope this isn't the only story we get from this author. He certainly knows a thing or two about telling a good story!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBLWG2EZ1VPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476773858#wasThisHelpful","R1VBLWG2EZ1VPB","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Gun for Hire is another great western historical romance from Jo Goodman. Goodman is an author that has great range, writing about everything from The Revolutionary War to the Old West and she does it all with flair and detail. This is the story of the bodyguard and the bounty hunter and how they come together to protect a prominent mining family who is receiving threats. Goodman doesn't pull any punches. Her characters have strength, integrity and often a feisty attitude and this book is no different. This one is a little on the lighter side than Goodman's usual fair and readers who love that distinctly western edge to their romances will love it!Jo Goodman is one of those authors that I often feel is overlooked. She has been around for a long time and has written some very engaging and wonderful reads. But I think the fact that she doesn't stick to a particular genre has hurt her a bit and that is unfortunate because more readers need to check her out. Her writing is very detailed and rich. She uses not only humor and vitality, but the darker side of human nature as well. The Gun For Hire has a lighter side to it that is fun and enjoyable to read. It may not have as much darkness or angst as some would like, but I found it to be one of my favorites by this author.Characters Quill and Calico balanced each other in a delightful way. The banter between them was easy to follow and a lot of fun. I liked the way her sassy attitude complimented his larger than life cowboy persona. Calico was a rarity in the old west, a female bounty hunter. She had guts, she could use a gun and she also had that sensual side that reminded me of Sharon Stone in the movie, The Quick and the Dead. Quill was the handsome lawyer, turned bodyguard. He had a duty to protect and a sexiness that exuded from him. Together these two made the romance aspects of this book smoulder. Though, I felt the romance wasn't the main plot of the book, it certainly gave the reader what they wanted in a steamy relationship between two strong characters.I think the western part of the story was the main focus of this book. But it was not like the romance was an afterthought. It added a spark to the story for sure. I liked the fact that Goodman took a good western and enhanced it in such a way that readers of both the romance and western genres would find it appealing. It was a good balance, but I found myself focusing in on what was happening in this mining town, who was behind all the shenanigans and the threats against the Stonechurch family.The secondary characters were as full detailed as the main characters and Goodman set a very good pace for this read. I think there is a lot here for readers to enjoy and I hope that more of you will check out other books from this author. Goodman is a favorite of mine and I hope she will become a favorite of yours too. If you are looking for a book with romance and historical appeal, This Gun For Hire is a great choice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R119XS9VI4KMSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425277437#wasThisHelpful","R119XS9VI4KMSH","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lisa Nicholas returns with a follow up to her successful debut novel, The Farther I Fall. Her newest book, As Lost As I Get is a romantic suspense thriller that will have readers on the edge of their collective seats. Danger is around every corner of the Colombian jungle in this heart stopping story that has that suspenseful edge, as well as, a good solid romantic connection. Readers looking for a new author in romantic suspense genre can't go wrong with Nicholas. Her sophomore effort is just as satisfying as her debut and comes with a cast of characters that are well defined and a plot that is gripping and full of energy.The Farther I Fall was a great debut novel and I'll have to say that I was somewhat skeptical that the follow up would be as good. Sometimes when an author comes out with an outstanding first novel, it's a little bit hard to top. Nicholas proves that theory wrong with As Lost As I Get. I could see the author's growth in her writing with this one on every page. Her characters showed much more depth, their back stories were easier to follow and more fleshed out and Nicholas did a wonderful job of making them relatable even though most of us readers will never be CIA operatives or doctor's in a foreign land. But that's the beauty of romantic suspense, we get all the action, but none of the real danger!LOLLee and Zoe have a past, which is one of favorites ways to start out a romance. They already have a connection, something that ties them together and gives the story somewhere to go right from the start. In this case that start is a bit more intense than most. Lee is, in a sense, Zoe's knight in shining armour. Their shared past involves Lee rescuing Zoe after being kidnapped. Now, they find themselves once again in a situation where their lives are on the line and intensity of the situation only inflames their feelings for each other. Nicholas gives readers a great balance between the action and the romance in this one.I liked the fact that the lead character, Zoe, wasn't a damsel in distress. She was a woman who could handle herself in some pretty dangerous situations. Her commitment to helping others was also a quality that I loved. Lee might be the big muscular type that you might expect for a CIA operative, but he also had a big heart and he wasn't afraid to use it. Nicholas made these characters stand out and stand on their own and that was refreshing. Usually in this genre you run the risk of making your characters either too strong or too weak. This one has a good balance in every aspect of the story.Bottom Line:I wasn't entirely sure how Nicholas was going to work this one out in the end. You have two strong characters who love their work and no real way for them to be together on a normal basis. But I shouldn't have worried, the solution Nicholas found was perfect for the characters and for the story. Nobody gave up anything and everybody was satisfied, including me as a reader. A great second effort from an up and coming author in the romantic suspense genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YAIYOF4LWSN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZKJK#wasThisHelpful","R2YAIYOF4LWSN5","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In Still the One, we have two characters that contrast each other well. Darcy is recovering from a serious accident which has completely changed how she views life. I think Darcy's character is a little hesitant, a little fearful and is a woman who is trying to find herself again. I know that there are many readers out there who will be able to relate. The fact that she is using her own funds to find homes for retired service dogs is a cause that really spoke to my heart, since I am in need of a diabetic service dog myself. A great cause to champion as a character and as an author.AJ is a strong man. He is a confident, take charge kind of person. He see's a need in the lives of his physical therapy patients and he tries to solve that need. I think he will appeal to those readers who enjoy a hero that protective and intense. Finding the funds to continue helping others is a worthy goal and makes AJ, super appealing. Shalvis writes both characters in the book with such care, it is easy to see that she is moved by them as completely as the reader is.Six books into this series, I think Shalvis has hit a good stride here. This is my favorite of the series so far, mostly because it hit home for me a bit with the service dog aspect of the story. But there is a lot for a reader to love about this book. I loved the humor that Shalvis uses and she made me want to visit a little town like Sunshine, Idaho. Her attention to detail drew me in and kept me glued to the pages. Certainly, not one readers will want to miss.Bottom Line:I always enjoy a book that doesn't make the romance the only interesting part of the story. I love a good romance, but I want a little substance to and I think Shalvis gives reader that perfect balance. Darcy and AJ have a shared past. They have some obstacles to overcome both in their romantic lives and in their personal lives. I liked the fact that they weren't perfect. They were real and that made all the difference. Shalvis knows how to write good characters and readers will not be disappointed with this one!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LWLB9Q7X4EQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425270181#wasThisHelpful","R3LWLB9Q7X4EQX","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elizabeth Lynn Casey continues her long running Southern Sewing Circle mystery series with her latest book, Wedding Duress. Readers who love the series will be enthralled by Tori and Milo's wedding plans and how that effects the Sweet Briar Sewing Circle. It's not fun and roses with circle in this book, as Leona once again speaks her mind, when she probably should have kept it shut. There is also murder afoot when a nanny from England ends up at the bottom of a basement staircase. A great addition to this ever changing series!One of the things that I always find interesting about this series is the way that Casey is able to change things up. Readers have become accustomed to all the ladies in the sewing circle now that the series is ten books in, but I think there is still so much to learn about all of the ladies and their amazing friendships. Beatrice is a character we rarely hear anything from in the series and I thought Casey did a fantastic job of bringing her into the spotlight. Beatrice becomes a focal point that was unexpected and very enjoyable.There is a lot going on in this addition to the series. Tori and Milo's wedding is just around the corner, Beatrices' former nanny has taken a tragic tumble and Leona is simply being herself in this one. Casey does a great job of melding all of the sub plots together to form an amazing cozy. We get a great mystery, time with friends and plenty of drama, both murderous and childish. I loved the way it all worked itself out.The mystery aspects of this one were intriguing. Beatrice's friend and former nanny Miss Grace is dead. It could have been an accident but Beatrice doesn't think so. It's up to the ladies to figure it all out. At first I thought I had it figured out, early on. Then after a few twists and turns, I wasn't too sure. When the final reveal came, I was dumbfounded. Nope, I did not have this one anywhere close to right... lol. That made it just perfect for me. Casey made the killer illusive and full of surprises.Bottom Line:If you love a good cozy series, that has long standing characters and intriguing new plots, the Southern Sewing Circle books are for you. Wedding Duress centered around Tori's wedding, but it wasn't overwhelmed by it. Casey certainly kept me in the dark as to who the killer was until the very end. I love it when I'm totally surprised by what happens. A great read and a great addition to the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UYBG3XI0DRQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042525786X#wasThisHelpful","R3UYBG3XI0DRQD","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers are treated to a one-two-three knockout with Jodi Thomas's latest book in the Harmony series. One True Heart features not one, but three romantic couples. Readers who love this series will love the mix of old and new characters that Thomas brings to the ninth book in the series, about a small Texas town, steeped in history and love. This series just keeps getting better and better. In the tradition of authors like Debbie Macomber and Sherryl Woods, Jodi Thomas gives readers real stories about real people that will touch the heart. A great addition to the series!I have lately become a huge fan of Jodi Thomas and I am often surprised at how long it took me to find her books. The Harmony series is one that strikes close to heart with me. The characters always seem so easy to relate to. The have problems and issues that my best friend might have. They deal with life's ups and downs in a realistic fashion and always bring a smile to lips. Life isn't perfect and I don't want to read about perfect characters. These characters are real and that makes all the difference.In One True Heart, readers get a real mix of romantic encounters. Thomas gives us three love stories instead of just one. I liked the way that Thomas gave each couple ample time to find each other for the first time or to find each other again. I didn't feel like any one romance out shined the other or took anything away from the other. Each one had time to blossom and grow. I was interested to see how they all fit together and I was certainly not disappointed, Thomas has a knack for making it all work out.I think my favorite story of the bunch belongs to Johnny and Kare. Johnny is accused of murdering his wife, Scarlett and just about everyone in town believes he did it, even his family. Kare is a fortune teller who doesn't always go with the flow. She believes he's innocent and sets out to prove it. It was interesting watching their emotions for each other grow while Johnny was in jail. It gave a unique perspective to the story that was very engaging.Millanie McAllen is a daughter of one of the founding families in Harmony, but she has been away at war for a long time. As an Army Captain she could have come across as staunch and hard, but she didn't. I liked the romance between her and Drew and how she was able to resolve his past with the man she had learned to care for in the present. I liked her as a character and thought she added a lot to the Harmony community.I wasn't quite as into Beau's story as I was the other two couples, but that was just a pet peeve of mine. I have a hard time putting 'famous' characters in romantic situations with the common gal. The president of a bank no less. I did like the angle of how much ""Trouble"" had changed since Beau knew her as a teen and that did redeem that part of the story for me a bit. Also Beau's relationship with his father was a very heartfelt part of the book.Bottom Line:This a great three for one story. One True Heart takes three romances and meshes them so wonderfully that the reader can't help but smile. Jodi Thomas is a master at making her characters relatable and easy to like. This might be the ninth book in the series, but it isn't slowing down any. I hope to see many more Harmony books out there. This was one was simply outstanding!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K171DMMZZ9SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425268411#wasThisHelpful","R2K171DMMZZ9SM","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like your Regency romances with a splash of the paranormal than Brooklyn Ann's, Scandals with Bite series, is right up your alley. The third book in the series, Bite at First Sight is an entertaining mix of historical and paranormal romance. Readers who like strong heroines and brooding heroes will not be disappointed with this addition to the series. Rafe is the Vampire Lord of London and Cassandra is a would be doctor. Together they become embroiled in betrayal, political intrigue and a very steamy romance. A great addition to the series!This is my first book in the Scandals with Bite series and my first by this author. I think I would have benefited from reading the other two books in the series first, but Bite at First Sight does stand on it's own well. There were a few mentions of things that went on in the previous books, but not enough to throw me off while reading it. Brooklyn Ann did a good job of backtracking, but not becoming distracting.My first impressions of this author were for the most part good. I liked the world building in this book and found the subplots intriguing and full of surprises. Her characters were on point and I found myself really interested to see where she would take them throughout the story. Ann's transitions were good and I didn't feel like anything in the story was filler or fluff. The romance scenes were hot and steamy and very evocative. Overall I liked this one a lot.Rafe's backstory was interesting and Cassandra had all of the marks for a good heroine. I tend to like my heroes a bit on the alpha side and Rafe most definitely fit that bill, though he did cave in regards to Cassandra, but that was a good thing. Rafe's scars gave him a distinctive manner that added to his commanding aura, but it also gave him a vulnerability that is missing in some Regency and PNR heroes. A very well thought out character!One of my favorite parts of this one was the balance between the Regency elements and the paranormal elements. Even though Rafe was a vampire he still adhered to what I expected from a Regency character. The customs of the day and the political climate were still true to form and Ann did a wonderful job with those parts of the book. It made the setting come alive and became essential to the story.Cassandra was a woman before her time and a very pleasant character to read about. She wanted nothing more than to practice medicine in a time when it was unheard of for women. I liked that aspect of the story and her desire to find out more about Rafe's physiology. What better way to learn than to explore, lol. The romantic parts of the book were spot on and readers will love it.Bottom Line:Brooklyn Ann was a great new author for me. She put two genres together that I love. Regency and paranormal. Her characters were engaging and full of life and I loved the brooding alpha male vs. the smart would be doctor theme. The behind the scenes action was perfect for the book, from betrayal to politics. The Regency setting was still kept intact, but spiced up a bit with a vampire and really hot romance. Great job with this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTDGZ44D4AI9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402274505#wasThisHelpful","RTDGZ44D4AI9X","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amanda Lee takes readers back to Tallulah Falls just in time for the Renaissance Fair. Wicked Stitch is the eighth book in the Embroidery Mystery series and readers who love a good yarn will love this one. Marcy Singer, owner of The Seven Year Stitch is putting up a booth in the fair along with several other shop keepers including her enemies Nellie and Clara. Lee captivates with well drawn characters, more than one mystery and plenty of eclectic knitting, embroidering and other arts. Readers who want a cozy with some flare will find this one right up their alley. A good addition to the series!This series has been kind of hit or miss for me. Some of the books have had engaging plots and plenty of suspense and mayhem and others, not so much. With Wicked Stitch, Amanda Lee starts out on a good track. The Renaissance Fair theme is unique and full of potential for lots of interesting havoc. I liked the fact that Lee puts Marcy up against the sisters who want to ruin her. Nellie and Clara are always up to some no good and they make for an entertaining read.Lee's ability to write good characters is the salvation for this series. Not only is Marcy, multi-faceted and fun to read about, but so are the secondary characters in the series. Ted, Marcy's love interest is always there to help her investigate and this time the murder of Clara ties in with a cold case Ted has been working, so readers get a two for one. I love it when there is some secondary conflict that the reader can get into along with the main story line. Lee pulls that off well here.Once the big reveal came at the end, the story starts to rush a long at a head long speed. Basically, you find the killer and the end of the book sneaks up on you. I wanted a little more explanation and time to see the direction the next book would take and I didn't get that here. But this was a very solid book in the series and I think Lee did a great job with it.Bottom Line:This was a good book. It had a great theme with the Renaissance Fair and the murder wasn't easy to figure out. The characters as always were believable and down to earth. Ted and Marcy's romance is both sweet and comfortable. Even though there was a murder and an arson case, it just didn't heat up the pages for me. It was good... but perhaps not great. I recommend it to readers who are fans of the series and those who love embroidery. A good addition to the series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGMAXC3I6PT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=045146740X#wasThisHelpful","RKGMAXC3I6PT9","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jennifer Ashley's Shifters Unbound series is fast becoming one of my favorites in the paranormal romance genre. Her latest book Mate Bond is ultimately my favorite of the series so far. Readers who looking for a mature romance, with couple who has been married for some time will love this one. Bowman and Kenzie may have a wonderful relationship but they do not share the mate bond that will keep them together forever. Their struggle to find an illusive foe hinges on their relationship and readers won't be able to put it down for a minute. A great addition to the series!Ohhhh, I really liked this one! Jennifer Ashley is sooo good at world building. In Mate Bond readers get to see what the North Carolina pack's Shiftertown is like. We have seen other Shiftertown's in previous books, but this one was really interesting. If you are unfamiliar with the series, a Shiftertown is kind of like an Indian Reservation. The shifters have been forced to live in these towns away from the human population. Each one is unique and I loved learning about the Bowman and Kenzie's town. Ashley never ceases to amaze when it comes to her mythology and world building, it's one of the best parts of this series.I liked the fact that this book wasn't a boy meets girl and falls in love story. Kenzie and Bowman have been together for a long time and even have a son, Ryan, who will one day lead the pack. It was a marriage of convenience that united the dissident parts of the pack, but it turned into something more. It is obvious that this couple loves each other very much, but they have yet to form the elusive mate bond that will ensure that they will be together forever. I liked the maturity of the story here. There problems were a lot more dynamic and deep than the problems a reader generally finds with a new relationship. I thought that was a great idea for the book and loved how it worked out.Kenzie and Bowman are up against a really devious villain and the things he does are simply gut wrenching. He made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. That part of the book was cleverly put together and I think readers who like a story with substance will really find this one up their alley. This guy was a real piece of work and the way the hero and heroine solve the problems that comes with the bad guy was simply awe inspiring. I loved that part!The romance is hot and steamy in this one and it seemed completely natural. You have two alpha shifters, which is a volatile combination in the first place. They have a lot of passion in and out of the bedroom and readers who like a little heat will not be disappointed. Ashley seems to really understand the kind of aggressive and fierce relationship that needs to happen in this kind of shifter society. Very well done.Bottom Line:This is my favorite book in the series so far. I am becoming a huge fan of this author and I think anyone who loves a good were story will fall in love with this one. Kenzie and Bowman were a mature couple with mature problems and I liked the fact that they knew exactly where they stood with each other. The romance was hot, the action was fast and readers will just have to hold on for dear life. A great new book from a very talented author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2UX8B8U4XH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425266052#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2UX8B8U4XH7","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gina Lamm continues her quirky time travel romance series, the Geek Girls with her latest book, Kiss the Earl. Lamm combines Regency England with a modern woman and comes up with an interesting and delightfully original novel. Readers who love a bit a humor with their romance will find this one endearing with a very sweet hero and a heroine that must make the decision to stay in the past or return to her life in the future. A very good addition to the series!One of the things I like about this series is the fact that Gina Lamm doesn't apologize for her heroines. They don't try to mask who they are or try to fit into the Regency mold. Ella in Kiss the Earl doesn't even change the manner of her speech and I think that sort of detail is what makes this series so special. These modern women can't find the men they want in their own time and end up going to the past to find love. I think Lamm is onto something with this kind of time travel romance. It will appeal to the geek spirit in all of us.Ella was a great heroine. Sassy and full of spunk. A comic book artist, so she obviously had a sense of humor and a sense of the unusual. She had traveled to the past before so she wasn't completely clueless about what was going on, she just didn't expect to meet her own Mr. Darcy. I liked the fact that the decision wasn't an easy one for her. She didn't just throw away her career or her Mr. Right on a whim. She was the kind of heroine that you could believe in and I think that made all the difference in this book.Patrick was a good hero. But he was a little too nice at times and it generally ended up getting him in trouble. His best friend Amelia was something else and he was always getting pulled into one scheme or another but when he accidentally kidnaps Ella instead of Amelia, he ends up meeting the woman of his dreams. I thought Lamm did a good job with this character, but he could have had a little more depth. He was just too nice... LOL! If that makes any sense.Bottom Line:Another very good book from Gina Lamm. I like the Geek Girl series for a lot of reasons. The time travel thing is a very of mine and seeing how these modern women face the challenges of the Regency period is always fun. I loved the heroine, Ella and found myself pulling for her to make the right decision, but the hero, Patrick was a little too Mr. Perfect. He could have had a little more depth and I would have liked it better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JDNVPO4W3W10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492607827#wasThisHelpful","R2JDNVPO4W3W10","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jenn McKinlay fans are sure to love her latest book in the Cupcake Bakery series. Do you like zombies? Are you ready for the zombie apocalypse? In Dark Chocolate Demise, the zombies get a little out of control and one ends up really, really dead. Readers who love this series will find this mystery just as tasty as the recipes in the back of the book. McKinlay never disappoints with her well rounded characters and sinister plots. This involves everything from zombies to mobsters and then some... A great addition to the series!Jenn McKinlay is such a versatile author. She can write about just about anything and make it good. She has several different cozy mystery series' and every one of her books is so unique and different from the last. I like the fact that she doesn't rehash old plot lines and she gives her readers a fresh and original take on everything she does, even zombies as in the case of her latest book.I will be the first to admit that I love any kind of paranormal elements in a book. The Cupcake Bakery series isn't really known for that sort of thing and the zombies in this book aren't supposed to be considered 'real' zombies. But believe it or not I don't like zombies, not in any sort of book, so I was very skeptical about whether or not I would like this one. McKinlay uses the zombie theme and it works well here. It hasn't changed my mind on the stupidity of zombies really, but I do think the people of this small town were having fun with it, until murder spoiled the party.The mystery elements are well thought out. I couldn't put my finger on the killer until the big reveal and that tends to be fairly rare for me. I thought each clue was well placed and Mel's form of investigation was as usual pretty spot on. The one thing I did have issue with was Mel's attitude toward this particular investigation. She had a 'you can't tell me what to do' thing going on that was a bit distracting from the case. But we all get like that from time to time, why not a good heroine as well?Bottom Line:For a zombie type mystery, not too bad!. Certainly not my favorite paranormal character but I liked the fact that the town was getting into to it. I liked the casket prop and the ties to the mob in this mystery. I wanted Mel to be a bit more responsible and less obnoxious, but I'm sure in the next book she will have some other sort of attitude. That's one of the good things about an ongoing series! A great addition to the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GSDWMR3L0GM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425258939#wasThisHelpful","R2GSDWMR3L0GM4","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jo Davis knows how to write suspense and she has a knack for getting into the heads of the guys and gals in blue. The Sugarland Blue series continues with Davis' latest book, On the Run. Readers who are looking for a great romantic suspense series, featuring the police will love this one. You get the gritty, raw stories from the street, but you also get the loyalty and unity of the squad. This book is a great combination of love and war, as Tonio goes undercover and finds that he might have gone from the frying pan to the fire when he falls for the bad guys, sister! Explosive...On the Run continues the story of Sugarland's finest and Jo Davis is at her best when she lets the story lead her. My one peeve about this whole book happens on the very first page. The prologue is really the end instead of the beginning. Then readers go back in time and get the rest of the story. I didn't need to know how it ended. It's a romantic suspense novel, I was already clued in and thought this was unnecessary and it took a little bit of the edge away from the story. It wasn't a deal breaker, but to happen at the very start of the book, made it a little disappointing.Davis is always a great author though, and the story itself went a long way toward redeeming itself. Having read about Tonio in previous books in the series, I knew his story would be intense. He is just the sort of guy who would find the good in just about any situation and he finds the good beneath the harsh demeanor and circumstances surrounding Angel. He's undercover, and he doesn't need to get too close, but he just can't help himself. Tonio was a great character and I thought Davis did a great job of making this story about him believable. Not many cops would fall for the enemy and I liked that take on the situation.Angel was not in a good place, but as a reader and in real life, I know that sometimes it takes the love of a good man or woman to turn someone around and Davis obviously knew this too. You put one hard nosed cop up against a hard nosed perp and you get a really intense relationship, inside and outside the bedroom. Angel was just what Tonio needed. But she was in trouble and he was bound and determined to protect her. He took protect and serve seriously and it really worked in this book.Jo Davis is always great at making her books flow naturally. I didn't get the feeling that anything she wrote in this book was just for show or filler. Everything had a purpose. Every scene was well thought out, even the romance scenes which were really hot, by the way. I liked the fact that previous characters were important in this one and that the Sugarland crew was once again there for each other and for Angel. Great storytelling.Bottom Line:A lot of action, a lot of intensity and plenty of hot loving! This book is a very good addition to the series, but I did not like the prologue. The end was literally at the beginning. I don't like the back tracking thing. It's a romantic suspense book, we know what is going to happen in a sense, but we don't need it spelled out for us. Beyond that pet peeve it was a good book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RICJWM0D0CZYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451467930#wasThisHelpful","RICJWM0D0CZYI","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Faith Hunter returns with her ninth book in the Jane Yellowrock series, Dark Heir. Jane and her partners at Yellowrock Security are up against their most dangerous foe yet. The Son of Darkness has escaped Leo's basement and he is about the reek havoc on New Orleans. Hunter once again shows readers what it takes to make a series thrive, with super intense action, multi-faceted lead and secondary characters and an ever changing plot, this book rocks! Readers get a little bit of humor, a taste of romance and most importantly one kick-butt heroine. A great addition to the series!Jane Yellowrock is probably one of my favorite paranormal heroines. She's a shapeshifter, a Cherokee and a vampire hunter. What a combination! It means that as a character she is one tough cookie. But in Dark Heir, Faith Hunter gives readers a different side of Jane. With the addition of a love interest, readers see a Jane that is a little softer a little more vulnerable and dare I say, a little bit sweet. Jane is still the same renegade readers have loved since the beginning of the story, but this adds another layer to her character that is very intriguing.Jane is up against the baddest of the bad in this installment of the series, the Son of Darkness and he has a bone to pick with her. Of all the things in Leo's basement, this one might be the scariest. An older than dirt vampire on a rampage. This is probably one of Hunter's best baddies so far. One of the things I particularly like about this series... never the same bad guy and this one is unique and simply maniacal. I loved the intensity this villain brought to the story.Another thing I loved about Dark Heir was the evolution of Jane's relationship with Beast. From the beginning of the series, Jane has fought with Beast, essentially fighting herself at every turn. In this book she is more centered, more in tune with that part of herself. She has accepted her dual nature and learned to live with it. I think that's what allowed her to let Bruiser in and allow him to become a part of her life. That touch of romance was unexpected and amazing!Bottom Line:If you love this series, you will love this book. If this is your first book in the series, it will leave you thirsting for the first eight. This is a well written, intensely action packed book, that will make you rethink what you know about this series. One of the best so far from Faith Hunter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUAE9FHK9RNFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451465962#wasThisHelpful","RUAE9FHK9RNFD","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Deadly Web is the second book in Kay Hooper's spin-off series, The Bishop Files. Readers who love the Bishop Special Crimes Unit books will find this one a spooky thriller with plenty of paranormal elements. Before readers got so caught up in vampires and werewolves, the paranormal characters were psychics and ghosts. Hooper has the market cornered on the psychic angle with this series. A great addition that will continue on the story threads of the first book in the series, The First Prophet.Kay Hooper must be psychic, she some how knew that readers would love this type of series. I have been a fan of Hooper for a long time, but I have really enjoyed her Bishop Special Crimes books and I was excited about this spin-off series. Hooper just seems to know what to write that will make the hair on the back of the readers neck stand up. She is a creepy writer and I love that. Her thrillers are what I might call spine tingling. They give me the heebie geebies... LOL! And that makes for a fantastic read.In the second book in this series, readers learn more about the disappearances that have been taking place in the psychic community. Tasha is a powerful psychic and now the target of some pretty menacing foes. The danger feels so real in Hooper's books that readers will want to keep the heroine safe. Tasha doesn't know that a secret society exists to protect the psychics and John Brody is one of them. He is a Guardian, charged with Tasha's protection. I loved the whole idea of the disappearances and how Hooper used it to create this eerie thriller.I will have to say that I felt like this one rambled a bit. There was a whole lot of things being said and not as much action as I would have liked or that I expected. Hooper's books are usually jam packed with action and suspense, but I didn't get that same feeling of urgency with this one. I wanted things to be settled and figured out , but it didn't seem like it had to be this second or else. I like that edge of your seat, nail biting kind of thriller and this one wasn't quite up to the challenge.Bottom Line:This is another very good book from a trusted writer in the romantic suspense genre. The paranormal elements are old school and satisfying. Sometimes I get tired of the same old vampire stories. A well written and thought out story about a psychic, hit the spot for me, but the action was on the down low in this one. I wanted more snap, more zing, but I know that Hooper is one of the best at that sort of thing and I'm sure the next book will prove it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRX8BG69ZEG70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0515153346#wasThisHelpful","RRX8BG69ZEG70","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Susan Wittig Albert continues the China Bayles series with her 22nd book, Death Come Quickly. Readers who enjoy an intelligent heroine will find China both smart and intuitive. Her background as a lawyer always makes things interesting and she has a sarcastic wit that enlivens every one of the China Bayles books. Albert has a knack for writing amazing characters and China has a sidekick or two that will have readers laughing and scratching their heads at times. Death Come Quickly is a paperback release and a great addition to the series.China is back. Susan Wittig Albert gives readers a lot to cheer about with this heroine. Not only is she smart but she's also determined. I like that in a heroine. I want a take charge kind of person to lead a good cozy and China is certainly that. Albert gives her a great voice, she is sarcastic but not annoyingly so and I was really excited to see if China would rise to the challenge once again in Albert's latest book. She most certainly does!This one had a whole lot going on. There is one murder that takes place in the present and one that takes place in the past. The cold case murder of a former art collector brought readers into a world where art and forgery went hand in hand. I loved the mystery aspects of this once since they centered around Mexican art. China uses her vast knowledge of herbs as well as her research skills from her lawyering days. A great combination of China's skills as an investigator.One of my favorite parts of this series is all of herb lore that Susan Wittig Albert imparts to her readers through China's interest in the the subject. I can't wait for each book to come out to see which herbs or plants are going to be featured. There is always something new and different to explore and learn about. This is one of those series' that always has a practical use beyond the book. Love that part of the series.Bottom Line:Pecan Springs hasn't changed much and long time readers of the series will love catching up with their old favorites while being introduced to new and engaging characters as well. China Bayles is a tough cookie and a great cozy heroine, smart about tons of things including deductive reasoning in murder cases and herbs and plants that fit into the story in several different ways. Death Come Quickly is one in a long line of great books by a great author. And the recipes aren't bad either! Great book...","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CF7044LIWW70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425255638#wasThisHelpful","R3CF7044LIWW70","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers who love the Guardians of Eternity series with love this novella. Darkness Eternal falls between books 7 and 8 of the series and is sure to bring a smile to long time readers. As readers await the final book in the series, this is a story that will remind them of all the things they loved about Alexandra Ivy's series in the first place. There is love, adventure, and a whole lot of action in this one, readers won't be able to put it down for a second.Alexandra Ivy is a great paranormal writer and the Guardians of Eternity series is beloved by many readers. When I heard that this story was going to be released as a novella, I was really excited. It first appeared in Supernatural, as one of a few other paranormal stories. But having it stand on it's own as a part of the series, was really great. The timing and placement of this novella falls between Tane and Layleh's story and Ariyal and Jaelyn's story. I think it is important the reader read Devoured by Darkness which explains some about Layleh's mother, Kata who is the heroine of this story. I does stand on it's own but I think the reader misses out on some of the nuances of the story if they don't know what has gone on before.Kata was a great character. Since this is a novella we don't get a lot of time to spend with her character. I think Ivy realized that readers needed to connect quickly and strongly with her. Kata has been held captive for centuries by her evil vampire twin sister, who wants nothing more than to torture and use her. Now that she's escaped she has to learn who she is without Markita's domination. I thought she was interesting and unpredictable. I wanted Kata to be this strong and imposing woman, but she really had some issues to overcome. A great character.Uriel was simply a wonderful hero. He is a vampire and his strength and poise is impressive. He is a loyal man who does everything he can for his friend and master, Victor. Victor asks him to protect Layleh's mother, Kata and once he makes the decision to do so, it doesn't matter what happens he is going to do it. I loved his determination in spite of his issues with the Jinn. He and Kata have a lot to overcome in very few pages. The journey they take through hell provides tons of action and these two really light up the pages with their passionate chemistry and unrelenting spirits.Bottom Line:This is a great novella for readers who love the Guardians of Eternity series. I don't think I would pick this one to read first if you've never read any others in the series, just because this one requires a little background because of the short page length. The characters were amazing and the story has a lot of adventure. Readers who love Alexandra Ivy will love this one. I was glad to see it in a novella by itself and I think it adds a lot to the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5IL44BBIOVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR6QU#wasThisHelpful","R3K5IL44BBIOVX","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marie Bostwick is the well known author of the Cobbled Quilt series. Bostwick brings readers a new book about family, love and the ties that bind. The Second Sister is a novel that will leave readers feeling uplifted and inspired, as Lucy, the heroine embarks on her own discovery of what life means and how important those we share it with are. Readers looking for a book that will stay with them long after the final page will love this one.I have read some of Bostwick's Cobbled Quilts books and I knew this one would be a keeper. Bostwick is one of those writers that puts a smile on your face when you see their books on the shelves. She has a knack for bringing the reader characters that are engaging and realistic. Heroes and heroines that could be your next door neighbors or the girl in the next apartment. I just knew when I got this one for review that it would be a book that resonated with me and it really was. So glad I decided to review it.The Second Sister is about family, first and foremost. A lot of things go on in this book and there are friendships and loves and several other emotional goings on, but it is really the relationship of Lucy and her sister Alice that forms the crux of the book. When the story begins Lucy is a workaholic on a mission to get her boss to the White House. She is driven and her career means everything to her. Alice is still living in their Wisconsin hometown, where she has remained since an accident at eighteen her mentally challenged.There is a lot of water under the bridge with these two sisters and when Alice accidentally overdoses, Lucy must come to terms with not only her death, but with her own feelings of guilt and unworthiness. I loved the fact that Alice's presence is still so strongly felt throughout the book, even though she passes away at nearly the beginning. I thought Bostwick did an amazing job of keeping Alice's character a part of the story. Alice was a character that will resonate with many different kinds of readers. I wish I knew someone who looked at life the way Alice did. It was simply a captivating read.Lucy didn't really know Alice. She spent eighteen years in her shadow and when Alice was no longer able to be in the spotlight, Lucy didn't want it. She ran away and refused to face herself or her hometown. Watching her grow as a character throughout this story, was like going on a journey to discover herself and Alice. She learned so much about herself, through learning about the kind of woman Alice was. I thought Bostwick treated the subject of guilt with a deft hand. She knew how to approach it, how to deal with it and how to draw the reader into it. I loved it.There is a bit of romance with someone Lucy went to school with and there is a lot to be said for Alice's amazing friends who become important in Lucy's life. The relationships between women are often either very good or very bad. Bostwick shows readers what having a good friend truly means here and I think readers will respond to it. It was nice to see Lucy start to open up to these women and share in their triumphs and struggles as they shared in her sister's life. I want close friends like these. They are hard to come by and it's amazing to read about them.Bottom Line:This is tearjerker, a heartwarmer and a inspirational journey. Bostwick writes with a lot of heart and emotion. She never fails to leave the reader feeling inspired and creative. Her prose flows off the page it is so well crafted and written. Every book by this author is about real life and The Second Sister is no exception to that rule. I loved Lucy and I loved Alice though we only see her in life for a short time. What a great story. You gotta read it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODC1MCWPRVGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617736554#wasThisHelpful","R2ODC1MCWPRVGM","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a fan of the Murder She Wrote television show you would probably love the Murder She Wrote book series by author Donald Bain. Readers and fans of the series both tv and books, love Jessica Fletcher, a writer from Cabot Cove who tends to find herself in the middle of just about every murder investigation that turns up in the area. Bain does an amazing job of keeping Jessica's voice alive, long after the tv show has ended. Killer in the Kitchen is the 43rd book in the series and Bain shows no sign of slowing down. A well written addition to the series!There's a new chef in town and he is ruffling a lot of feathers. Pepe Leboeuf has had a house in Cabot Cove for awhile but when he decides to start a new restaurant to compete with the others in town, he ends up dead. It's up to Jessica to prove that it is not one of the owners of her favorite restaurant, Leg and Claw, who did it. As always Donald Bain does an amazing job of writing Jessica. She is just the same inquisitive and plain spoken as she was in the tv show. I like the way she investigates. Straightforward and to the point. She isn't afraid to put herself in hot water to find a killer and she proves that in Killer in the Kitchen.The mystery aspect of this book was really interesting. I found myself captivated by Brad and Marcie and their struggle to make the Leg and Crab a great restaurant. Though Leboeuf may have been a threat to their livelihood, the reader knows that Brad was not the killer from the beginning. Finding out who really did it was the challenge. I liked the fact that Bain gives the readers good motives and good suspects in this one. It wasn't easy to figure out who did it, but it was fun to go from clue to clue and try to put the puzzle together.Cabot Cove is a great small town for a mystery series. Maybe not a great place to live since the murder count continues to grow, but still a great place to read about. I like the fact that Bain continues to figure out new ways to make this series seem new and inviting. That is something really difficult to do 43 books in. I think that speaks a lot to the writers versatility and imagination. Jessica is a great character to work with, but I think it takes a lot more than just a blueprint to go from to make a series great, regardless of whether or not readers are familiar with the show.Bottom Line:This book was a true cozy mystery. It was clue based and the reader could follow along just like the lead characters in figuring out whodunit. Bain was able to draw the reader in with a good hook and keep them on the line until the very end. I liked the fact that this one was set in Cabot Cove. Some of the books that Bain writes for the series that take Jessica out of her niche seem to fall a little short. But when she is in her hometown, Jessica and the story shines. I thought this one was particularly interesting. Readers who are mystery lovers and foodies can't go wrong with this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAE3IJVO6XQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451468384#wasThisHelpful","R3HAE3IJVO6XQC","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Manda Collins brings readers the first book in a new series. A Good Rake is Hard to Find is the first book in the Lord's of Anarchy series featuring a maniacal driving club that is up to more than just carriage races and pranks. Collins shows a lot of potential in this first book, with both romance and mystery at it's center. Her characters are captivating and the mystery of Jonathon's death is riveting. If readers are looking for a different face of the ton, this might just be the book for them!This was my first book by Manda Collins and I always love it when it happens to be the first book in a series. I am a series reader! I like books that tie together and share the same world and I think Collins sets up the Lords of Anarchy series very well here. Most usually in historical romance writing the ton has a particular set of rules and regulations as to how the characters act and are perceived. There is some dallying with mistresses and gambling and the like but you don't usually see the underbelly of the society. I liked the fact that the Lords of Anarchy series is showing a more of the sinister side of the ton. Readers know it existed, but they get a real look into it in this series. Original and engaging!Lenora Craven's brother is dead. Most likely at the hands of this driving club, the Lords of Anarchy. Lenora doesn't believe it was just a carriage accident and she sets out to prove it. Lenora was an interesting character. She had strong opinions and was a real feminist at heart. I thought she had guts and a spine which is more than a lot of Regency female characters get. She was determined, even when it meant spending time with her former fiancee. I liked her spunky and attitude. She was a take charge character and I thought Collins did a wonderful job with her.Fredrick was a little harder for me to understand. I realize that he was hurt when Lenora dropped him like a hot potato in the past and that he was Jonathon's best friend. He has been gone for five years but he slides right back into the game when he returns. I liked the fact that he was determined to get Lenora back and find out what went wrong between them. I also understood his need to find out what happened to his friend. But as a character he didn't quite grip me the way Lenora did. He was at times a little flat and hard to read, even though Collins was writing him as the hero. He was a still a good hero, but he lacked a little when it came down to it. It was a good romance, but it focused more on the mystery side of things.Collins knows how to write a villain. This guy was the kind that makes you want to wring your hands and wonder why these kinds of people exist. He was down right evil. The things that the Lords of Anarchy were involved in were things you would expect from the dregs of society not the elite. Good stuff and very well written. I'm interested to see how the concept carries through to more books in the series. A lot of potential here.Bottom Line:The whole premise of this romance was tied up in the story of Jonathon's death. It was impossible to separate the two ideas. That was good and bad. I felt like the book was a little lope-sided. The mystery kind of takes over at times and the romance becomes more of a sideline story. That's not to say that I didn't like it. It was a wonderful read. Lenora was a dream of a character and the concept of the Lords of Anarchy was indeed very intriguing and wonderfully written. The hero fell a little flat for me but there so much potential for this series that it hardly seemed to matter. A great first book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPA59RSI3L79Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250061067#wasThisHelpful","RPA59RSI3L79Y","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caris Roane's Savage Chains novellas, Captured, Scarred and Shattered, all come together in one volume, aptly named, Savage Chains. Readers who are looking for a complex vampire world that involves art, culture and even a bit of sex slavery will find this one gritty, raw and emotionally charged. Roane's attention to detail is unmatched and the world building in this one is intricate and well thought out. A very elaborate and satisfying compilation of Roane's Savage Chain's novellas!I have read a few Caris Roane books before and have never been disappointed by this author's command of the page. Her books are usually filled with multi-faceted and engaging characters, details that make the reader feel like they are part of the story, and world building that is fascinating. I wasn't sure that the compilation of three novellas would carry the same punch that I normally get from this author. I always feel like I want more from the story with a novella, but I will have to say that Roane did this novella series proud. Savage Chains is basically a novel in three parts. Though each was originally a separate novella, they flow seamlessly in this book.Reyes, the hero has gone through some rough stuff in his past, including being a sex slave for a century. That gives him the drive to bring down a sex slave ring within his vampire world. Now, I don't know about you, but that's a concept I have never even thought of when it comes to vampires before. I read a lot of paranormal fiction and I think that's the first time I've really seen this sort of thing. A very original and captivating idea. It sets up the concept that vampires have the same sort of problems in their societies that you might find in the human world. Great idea!I liked Reyes very much. He comes off as a tattooed, bad boy and he is, but he also has a heart. He shows a lot of vulnerability and passion. He was the kind of character that you would expect to go into every single thing he does with vigor and strength. He fights hard and he loves hard. I think that passion carries over into not only his love life, but into his soul. Now that's some good character development in my opinion. Roane develops this character so precisely that readers feel like they know him inside and out.Angelica, the heroine was also drawn indepth. she was a firecracker. She was smart, resourceful and full of zeal. I liked her from the first page. She wanted more than just her mundane life and thought she might have found the excitement she craved by taking Reyes home. When he doesn't seem to share her feelings she is left confused and hurt. Unfortunately she gets the thrills she wants in life in a bad way. She is taken prisoner and about to be sold as a sex slave. Roane gives readers a woman, who wants more and more than she bargained for. Angelica and Reyes together make a very passionate and strong lead couple.Bottom Line:Great concept for a novel. The world building is amazing. The detail to which Roane goes to make her vampire society realistic is simply incredible. A lot of authors write paranormal fiction, but Roane writes it in such a way that the reader feels like they know these characters, that they share in their struggles and triumphs. It was a great book, with fiery lead couple and some sexual tension. This is a hot one, you might need a cold drink... or two!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AGDWDL6PND10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250037999#wasThisHelpful","R1AGDWDL6PND10","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SM Seine brings readers a spin off series from the world of the Ascension. Omega is the first book in the War of the Alphas series and features Deidre, a shapeshifter that is unable to shift. Readers who are familiar with the Ascension series already know about Genesis and how normal mundane people die and wake as werewolves, vampires and other creatures. This heroine has a problem, she's a shifter but she doesn't know what animal she is supposed to be. Seine continues to blow the minds of readers who love her writing and style.I have read a few of the Ascension books and liked them very much. I was excited to hear that there would be a spin off series that would feature some of the characters from the Ascension world. Deidre is a really strong character. Reine was able to make her status as an Omega seem like a badge of honor for this character. She used it to her advantage though she desperately wanted to know what was wrong with her and how to fix it. Deidre wasn't too sure whether to trust Rylie, the alpha or to side with Everton, the usurper. It was interesting to see how Reine made that choice play out and how it will affect the rest of the series.The world building in this series is pretty amazing. It takes the world of Ascension and somehow magnifies the players and tensions. In the Ascension series you got that feeling of urgency, but it wasn't as prevalent as it was here. The reader is treated to a series that could potentially stand on it's own but Reine does mention things that have happened in the past. I don't think it's necessary to back track and read the whole series, but it might be wise to read the last couple of books, just to get the necessary background.Bottom Line:For me there has to be a reason for a spin-off. If it's really just a continuation of a previous series under a different name, I'm not that interested. With War of the Alpha's the Ascension world is a factor but certainly not the whole ball of wax. Reine has created a distinctly different set of characters and circumstances to set this series apart from her previous books. I loved Deidre and her tough attitude. She was a warrior in a lot of ways and I liked the way Reine wrote her. Looking forward to seeing if this series lives up to the last. A great first book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PO7U06CMDOR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508704376#wasThisHelpful","R2PO7U06CMDOR1","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jaci Burton returns with her fourth book in the Hope series, Love After All. This time it's Bash and Chelsea's story and readers will love the heat and sensuality of this novel. These two have been friends for a long time and Burton uses that familiarity and bond to develop a great romance. Ever made a list of all the qualities you want in a good man? Chelsea did and Bash intends to help her find one, while providing any kind of other help she needs, including the naked variety.Jaci Burton is always a favorite of mine, whether it's erotic romance or contemporary. She just has a way of making the reader feel comfortable and relaxed with her stories. There is not a lot of angst or super charged emotions. The reader gets a great story without all the hoops to jump through. That's not to say that there is no action or no conflict. It's just not overwhelming. It seems more realistic and authentic.Chelsea and Bash have been great secondary characters in previous books in the series and now they get their own story. I was really excited to read this one and I wasn't disappointed. Chelsea is real firecracker. She has a sassy attitude and seems to always end up with the wrong kind of man. She and Bash have flirted before and have a nice camaraderie going. But he does not meet the criteria that Chelsea has for a the perfect man. I loved the idea of using the list and Bash trying to help her find a man when he was really the right one for her. Great concept!Bash was a great hero. Not because he proper and upstanding but because he wasn't necessarily any of those things. He was a real man, with real problems and real motivations. I liked the fact that Burton gives him a kind of edge and commanding attitude, but he doesn't lord it over Chelsea. He comes off as very sexy and handsome and actually very thoughtful. He owns a bar and works a lot. He is not the sort of man Chelsea is looking for on paper, but they fit regardless! Just a great couple.Bottom Line:Once again Jaci Burton brings readers an amazing romance with lots of heat and sensuality. I loved Bash, because he wasn't perfect. On paper he was a mess but for Chelsea he was very, very right. I thought using the list was a great way to get the story moving and Burton was able to create a romance that was fun and sexy. A great addition to the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14IIDH2WHM113/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0515155632#wasThisHelpful","R14IIDH2WHM113","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Devil's Moon is another great historical romance from author Amanda Scott. This story is second in the Border Nights series and takes readers to the border lands between Scotland and England at a very traumatic time in the history of both countries. Scott has a way with writing about this time period. She uses her vast knowledge of the times and customs to give readers a very detailed and alluring novel. Devil's Moon is about more than just two people falling in love... it's about family and loyalty and protecting your heart as well as you hearth. A great addition to the series!Amanda Scott is soooo very good at writing historical romance. She is what I would call a master. She uses the historical background to give the story authenticity. Scott did her homework for this series and it shows. Every description about the political climate and times is precise and detailed. The little things make all the difference in this one and she makes the story seem like a real account of what happened instead of fiction. A hallmark of a good author.Robina is a heroine after my own heart. She is a stubborn one and she does not see any reason to get married. She loved her older twin brother very much but his death in battle has left her in a precarious situation. She must care for her younger brother until he comes of age to rule as laird of the clan and she must keep the suitor and raiders at bay. I admire the Highland spirit and I think Robby personified that strong, resilience that the Highland people were known for. A wonderful character.Devil Ormiston was Robina's brothers best friend. They have known each other for years. But things are different now. Her brother is dead and she can't help but blame Dev for his death. On top of that he is only just now starting to see her as a woman and not the girl he grew up with. I loved Dev's determination to protect Robina and her home. It may have been a dying promise to her brother when it began, but it becomes much more than that. I felt like Dev was such a good example of a hero. He doesn't want to rule over Robina, he wants to help her. I found him intriguing and quite sexy.Bottom Line:The romance takes center stage in this one, because of the strength of Scott's ability to write good solid characters, but the historical aspects of the story were so necessary. I thought Scott got as close to fact as possible without going over the line. This story is fictional but it was so remarkably realistic that it was easy to forget at times that it didn't take place in history. An all around enjoyable story from a great author. Can't wait for the next one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K37LYLYYVNPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455556661#wasThisHelpful","R1K37LYLYYVNPC","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Diamond Conspiracy is the fourth book in The Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences series. This is really great steampunk writing. Readers who love the genre, not only get an alternative London in this series, but also some great cameos from political and literary notoriety. Pip Ballantine and Tee Morris blend remarkably well in their writing style and give readers a very cohesive and fun story. A great addition to the series!Steampunk isn't for everyone, but if you like it and understand it, this is a great series. The concepts that make up the steampunk genre are on center stage here. Readers get to learn about a lot of interesting steampunk gadgetry and experience an alternative to the London they know and love. One that is more sinister and more entertaining. There is an element of fun about this series that pervades it, but it also has those dark undertones that make you feel all creepy at times.... love that feeling in a book!Books and Braun are back with another adventure in this addition of the series. They are just learning how to deal with their new found relationship status. In the last book, they decided to stop fighting their attraction and just go for it. I love them as a couple, but I wondered if it would take anything away from how they worked together. I shouldn't have worried Ballantine and Morris, made it seem natural and it was fun. I liked how they weren't sure what to make of it. LOL.I absolutely loved learning more about Wellington's past. He tends to remind me of an eccentric Sherlock Holmes at times and I wanted to know more about him. I was really captivated by this part of the book. He is an archivist... not exactly the kind of person you would pick to be a crack shot with a rifle. We know that his childhood was not the best, but we learn so much more that explains why he is how he is here. Just great writing. I can also tell that it will play a big part in future books.Eliza was, as usual, a joy to read about. I enjoy her intelligence and her savvy intuitiveness. The Ministry of Seven, the child informants that Eliza counts on, has gotten themselves into a mess and it's up to Braun and Books to save them... and the entire empire. I love the large scope of these books. It's always do or due. Save the cheerleader, save the world kind of stuff. It gives each adventure an epic feel. I think that's what I love most about steampunk.Bottom Line:This is another great book in the Ministry of Peculiar Occurences series. I really enjoy steampunk so it was right up my alley. Why do I love it? Because it's not paranormal... it's not exactly romance... it's not really a mystery... it's new and different and oh so very refreshing. I think Ballantine and Morris understand what readers of steampunk novels want and they show it here. Strange gadgets, Victorian London turned upside down and some amazing characters. Loved this one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T1QTPHFWXVDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425267326#wasThisHelpful","R2T1QTPHFWXVDI","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joanna Shupe brings readers the first book in her Wicked Deceptions series, The Courtesan Duchess. Readers who love historical romance will find this one enchanting. What do you do when you husband runs away after he says ""I do""? That is the question this book answers in a fun and sensual way. Shupe's attention to detail is meticulous and she brings the period into vivid focus. The characters are multi-faceted and full of surprises. This is one of the best I've read this year and the genre. Reader's won't want to miss it.There was just something about this book. This was first experience with Joanna Shupe's writing and I was captivated. Shupe gives readers a rather interesting premise for this book. The groom runs away from the bride and the bride hatches a plan to seduce him. Add in some advice from a lady of the night, a title in peril and danger around every corner and you've a formula for success. This was a really amazing book. Shupe drew me in and didn't let me go.Historical romance is one of those genres that has to get under your skin. A lot of the titles are set in England, as is this one, and the general storylines are very similar. It takes a creative and talented author to put a new spin on it and Shupe certainly does that with this book. It was refreshing and very original. I liked very thing about it. The characters were so life like and entertaining. I just wanted to know more an more about them and Shupe didn't disappoint.Julia is tired of being left alone. She has a husband, but he doesn't really know anything about her or want to be with her. What would you do? I'm not sure I would impersonate a women of ill repute, but that could possibly work... LOL! I does in this story in a magical way. When Julia goes undercover as a courtesan, she takes all the pressure off Nick. He doesn't have think about what it will mean to his title or anything else. He just has to sit back and enjoy the ride. The problem comes in when Julia realizes that she really does like him. I thought she was just a joy to read about. Strong, independent and definitely resourceful. But most of all she was sultry and sensual and very passionate. There are some very hot moments in this one... bring a fan and a cold drink!Nick was an interesting hero. He wants nothing to do with his estate and title. He wanders the country gambling and womanizing. I had a little bit of a hard time understanding why he was so disillusioned at first, but he is totally captivated by Julia and that was endearing. I understood his feelings of betrayal when he found out that he had been played, but he hurt her too, when he left. I didn't think he had the right to blame her completely and I was glad when things turned out all right for them. I liked Nick, but I loved Julia.Bottom Line:This is a really good book. Once you start it, you won't want to put it down. It's unique and different in a genre that is saturated with the same kinds of stories. Shupe makes her characters simply jump off the page. I liked the lead couple and found a lot of comical moments in the secondary cast. I thought the setting was drawn perfectly and really can't find anything that I didn't like. Nick turned out to be a sweetheart, even though I didn't want to like him in the beginning and Julia was a blast through and through... Read this one, I know you'll like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UWY1ZG5X4GRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142013552X#wasThisHelpful","R2UWY1ZG5X4GRW","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you love dogs? How about second chance romances? If so... then D.D. Ayres' new book, Force of Attraction will be right up your alley. Force of Attraction is the second book in the K-9 Rescue series. Ayres is a pro at writing romantic suspense. Her stories will have you sitting on the edge of your seat and smiling from ear to ear. There is a good balance between action and romance in this novel as well as fully developed characters, even the canine ones! A great addition to the series.D.D Ayres must love dogs. Her non-human characters are always exceptional. I loved Hugo in this one and thought Ayres did a wonderful job of bringing him to life. He doesn't have any magical powers but he is still a superhero. I think Ayres had a really good idea using canines in this romantic suspense series. I think they are an integral part of a lot of police departments and it's nice to see them get a leading role in a series.Cole was a strong woman. I liked her from the very first page. She changed her life, got a new job, even a new nickname. Not something that comes easy to anyone. When she is suddenly thrust back into the past, working with her ex-husband, she shows a lot of strength of character and I thought Ayres wrote her perfectly. It's never a walk in park giving someone a second chance. Cole didn't take the easy way out and walk away. She laid her heart back on the line with someone who had hurt her badly before... now that's a different kind of courage.I liked Scott too. He is the kind of character that makes you redefine your definition of hero. This is a guy who gave up everything including his marriage to serve and protect. Undercover work is probably really difficult and easy to get lost in. I liked the fact that Ayres shows us that this hero wasn't perfect, he was real. His feelings for Cole never wavered and I was so glad that she gave him a second chance to do it right. Great character. Great chemistry.The action in this one was superb. I was practically biting my nails. He bad guy was really bad. He had this eeriness about him that make the hair on the back of my neck stand up... LOL. Now that's a villain. The balance between the romance and action was excellent. I think there was just enough of each part to keep this book from being pretentious or seeming contrived.Nicely done!Bottom Line:If you are a romantic suspense fan and love dogs, this just might the perfect series for you. The action and the romance are well balanced and I the thought Ayres did a great job with these characters. Hugo was a favorite of mine and I thought the dog show angle was interesting and fun. This was just a good story that I think a lot of romance and suspense fans will love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37WZROIZ5UKWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042186#wasThisHelpful","R37WZROIZ5UKWV","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paula Quinn brings readers the third book in the MacGregor's Highland Heirs series, The Scandalous Secret of Abigail MacGregor. This is a story of the turbulent pasts of both England and Scotland. Readers who love historical romance can't wrong with this one. Quinn's characters are well drawn and intriguing, while the premise of the book is complex and riveting. Secrets, betrayal, an assassination attempt, all of these things and more come into play in this novel. Quinn is on a roll with this series and this is the best book yet.Having read the other two books in this series, I was excited to review this one. Paula Quinn has what it takes when it comes to historical writing. She uses her imagination liberally and comes up with something that is not only entertaining, but historically plausible. It didn't happen this way, but could you imagine if it did? Quinn could and did. Loved it!Quinn has done her homework with this one. Being of Scottish descent means I take it seriously when a writer takes on a story involving the Highlands or Scotland in general. I want there to be a certain amount of authenticity in the writing. It's one thing to write about the Regency period that has been thoroughly saturated. Any good historical writer that is worth his/her salt could probably come up with something good, without a lot of research. Tackling the Highland spirit along with the difficult relations between England and Scotland, that's a little more ambitious and Quinn does it with style here.I loved Abigail. She was a true Highland lass. She was strong, courageous and independent. And she was stubborn as an ox... LOL! She had some sass to her and it was no wonder Daniel was stunned by her. Just a wonderful character and very well written. It was interesting seeing her grow and change throughout the book. Fall in love tends to do that to you. Daniel's change was incredibly gratifying as well. Going to from a Jacobite Killer to a Jacobite lover in one fell swoop. Great characters, with great chemistry. Quinn knows how to write a good love scene and fans to like books more on the romantic side get a great balance with this book. Lots of political intrigue and lots of lusty encounters. That's Scotland for you!Bottom Line:The best part of the book for me was the fact that not only Abigail but the rest of the MacGregor's have a part to play in this story. I also liked the whole Queen of England play in this novel. I wanted a lot of romance and I got it. I wanted a lot of mystery and political espionage and I got that too. Quinn is word master. Her skills at bringing her characters and the scene to life were simply magical. You gotta read this one... it's just that good!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GOK3EZN9YG3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455519499#wasThisHelpful","R2GOK3EZN9YG3O","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Queen of paranormal romantic suspense, returns with the third book in the Cafferty and Quinn series. Heather Graham's books always have that little touch of the paranormal in them and The Dead Play On is no different. This time it is in the saxophone of a dead Jazz player. Graham writes about the jazz scene in the city New Orleans like someone who has lived their all their life. She is able to give this book a dark, but sultry atmosphere that pervades it and gives the reader that chills down your spine kind of feeling. A great addition to this series!New Orleans is one my favorite cities to read about. It has this Old World kind of feeling mixed with the influences of Voodoo and Creole. Everything from the accents of the people to the traditions and rituals is dark and inky. Like you are seeing on part of what is really happening. It strikes me as a place of secrets and Heather Graham is sooooo good at bringing it to life. Whether it's the ghostly aspect of things or the mysterious aspect. Whether it's the music or the mayhem, Graham knows how to write this town.In The Dead Play On, Graham delves deep into the musical history of the town. Drawing on the legends and stories passed down from musicians and players to give the reader a mystery that will captivate them. I loved the way Graham takes the reader into the Jazz atmosphere and makes them want to feel the music as much as listen to it. Arnie was a Jazz saxophone player and when he died, his spirit seems to reside in his horn. What an interesting idea to base a mystery on. I liked the fact that it had to do with musicians and the music of New Orleans. Very well done!When Tyler, Arnie's best friend plays the sax given to him by Arnie's mother, something strange happens. Everyone thinks that Arnie died of a drug overdose but Tyler sees something completely different when he plays Arnie's horn. He sees the way he really died and he knows that this horn has something to do with the deaths of the other musicians in New Orleans. I loved the whole back story for this one. It was ingenious really. The killer looking for the horn almost driven by it to kill. I thought it was very well written, but most Heather Graham books are.Tyler appeals to Cafferty and Quinn to help him prove to the authorities that Arnie's death was a murder. Cafferty and Quinn have some expertise at crimes that are little out of the ordinary. I love the way these two characters work together. They play off each other and they aren't afraid to say that a crime has a supernatural element to it. They believe Tyler and it's up to them to prove it. I like the fact that there are two investigators with this series. Reminds me a bit of Scully and Moulder. LOL! Love it!Bottom Line:Another amazing book from Heather Graham. She is one of my favorites. The paranormal elements don't beat the reader over the head, they are subtle and intriguing. I don't know that I believe in ghosts or spirits or the essence of a person being left in their musical instrument, but I do believe in Heather Graham's ability to make me wonder if maybe that could be possible. A great book, you won't want to miss!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D308I5MWXVBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317730#wasThisHelpful","R2D308I5MWXVBH","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charlaine Harris brings readers the first book in a spin off series, featuring one of the character's from Harris' Harper Connelly series. Midnight Crossroad introduces readers to a small Texas town, aptly named, Midnight with a cadre of eccentric inhabitants. With names like, Chuy, Fiji, Bobo and Rev readers with eclectic tastes are sure to find it entertaining. This isn't your grandma's small town story though, there are extremists, vampires, psychics and a few witches thrown in for good measure. An interesting new book, from a great author.I'm not entirely sure what I expected with this one. Charlaine Harris is one of my paranormal favorites. She cashed in big time with the Sookie Stackhouse books and I think she was looking for that same kind of special formula with this book. A menagerie of quirky characters, a small town with some mystique and a hero/heroine that readers would fall in love with. I'm not sure that the cast of Midnight Crossroad was really able to pull of the same kind of excitement that the Sookie Stackhouse books did, but I think there is potential here.The characters in this book were definitely on the eccentric side. We have seen some of that before with Harris, take the character of Lafayette for instance, but it was a little more extreme in this one. Not just a few of the characters are offbeat. They all are. Even, Manford the character that crosses over from the Harper Connelly series, is not a normal sort of character. Even though the characters in the Sookie books were vampires and fairies and things like that they had some normalcy to their lives. This bunch not so much. I think the characters kept everything a little too close to the vest. I wanted to know more about them and what drove them and motivated them. I wanted to feel a part of their lives and I think that was what was really missing for me here. I still liked them. I found them intriguing. They had some interesting problems. But they didn't grab you quite so hard, as previous characters by this author have done.Having said that, I think Harris will probably divulge a lot more about the characters as the series progresses. She may have her reasons for writing this the way she did. In fact I'm sure she does. I want to know more about this town. What makes Midnight, Texas so desolate. It's practically a ghost town and what makes the people who live their tick. Why do they stay? What motivates them.The mystery aspect of the story was a bit of a slow start. What happened to Bobo's girlfriend? Was she dead? Was she alive? I was really surprised that we don't find out the answer to that very important question until well over half of the book has gone by. I had the curiosity necessary to keep on reading to find out, but it wasn't the same breathless kind of read I was used to from Harris. I wanted one of those mysteries that kept me on my toes and make me really think. No so much with this one.Bottom Line:I know I know I shouldn't compare this series to one of the most beloved urban fantasy series out there, but knowing Harris is the writer of both, my expectations were high. I won't say I was completely disappointed or that I won't read the next one, because I will. I love Harris and I love her writing, so it's a given I'll keep on loving it. But I think this book was a hiccup. I think she was trying a little too hard to give readers what they wanted and not writing just for a sake of writing. This series can evolve and I look forward to seeing where it goes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WJV7MTQPAIRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425263169#wasThisHelpful","R2WJV7MTQPAIRF","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sharon Sala starts off her new Secrets and Lies trilogy with the first book, Wild Hearts. Readers who are looking for an edgy writer, who develops complex mysteries will love Sharon Sala. She has a unique writing style that will appeal to many different kinds of readers. Sala brings readers a story of a would be suicide that ends up being murder. A murder that brings a lot long buried secrets to the surface in a small town, without a lot of places for a killer to hide... except in plain sight. Well written romantic suspense.Sharon Sala is one of those writers that really makes you think. She gets deep into the mystery side of her romantic suspense novels and she drags the reader right in with her. Before you know it you are knee deep in clues and finding more motives than you can shake a stick at. In Wild Hearts, readers are treated to a mystery arc that will continue throughout all three of the projected books in the series. So if you were looking for something that would wrap up in a neat little package, this isn't the book. It is however, a very well written mystery that has a bit of a cliffhanger.The romantic side of things could have been a little better, but the mystery really made up for it. Heroine, Dallas is looking into the suicide of her father. When it becomes clear that this was murder, not suicide, she enlists the help of an old flame, the local police chief, Trey. I liked these two together, but as with any good Sala book, it was more about the mystery than the romantic connection between the hero and heroine. I wanted more interaction and more emotional or even sexual tension. I wanted to like these two together, but they fell just a little flat for me.I liked the whole past and present colliding atmosphere that Sala created with this book. She gives the reader a current murder to solve, but she makes that murder contingent on a secret from thirty years ago. I liked how Sala connected the different time lines by clues and memories. It was an ingenious idea and she really pulled it off. I want to know what in the world happened back then and how it relates to the events going on in Dallas' life now.Bottom Line:Amazing mystery. Eh... on the romance. I thought Sala did a masterful job of setting up this story and drawing the reader in. She gives the reader a strong heroine who knows how to run an investigation. A hero that has all the right connections and a mystery that will keep readers guessing. The killer is hiding in plain sight and the motive is anything but typical. I wanted more from the romantic side of things, but then again this is a Sharon Sala book... heavy on the mystery, light on the romance. You'll definitely want to read it and you'll be chomping at the bit waiting for the next one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D532HYPHKIDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778318168#wasThisHelpful","R1D532HYPHKIDY","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brenda Novak brings readers the next book in her Whiskey Creek series, This Hear of Mine. This is a poignant, heart warming story about a young woman who has faced just about the worst life can throw at her and survived. Novak always knows just how much realism to add to her stories to draw the reader in and hold them in her grip. This story was a little deeper and a little more dark than some of Novak's work but it all works in an amazing way.I have read so many good books lately. And every time I read a Brenda Novak book, I get all warm and fuzzy inside. This one however was a little different, that's not to say that I didn't like it, because I did. I loved it. It was just not what I was expecting. It was a story that had many different layers and nuances. It was complex and full of surprises. Phoenix, the heroine was not your typical leading lady. I think Novak wanted to stir things up with this book and she succeeded with flying colors.Not only does Phoenix get a second chance at love, but essentially she is getting a second chance at life. Her childhood was rough to say the least. She was unpopular, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who actually gets a chance with a perfect guy. But he doesn't turn out to be quite so perfect. He breaks her heart and leaves her lonely and pregnant. And then to add insult to injury she gets accused of running down his new girlfriend. Talk about a past. This chick has one. I loved the fact that Novak introduced me to this character. She is strong and resilient and truly brave. I loved her. Now she has a second chance with Riley and her son, Jacob.I loved all of her interactions with Jacob and with Riley. Developing a relationship with a son you haven't really met is quite the challenge. Getting over the heartbreak of the love or your life is another one. Riley's family didn't make it the first time or the second time, but love prevails and readers are treated to a real second chance love story, not only between the woman and the man, but between the mom and son as well. What a great story!Riley was sexy and confident. But he made some mistakes the first time around with Phoenix that nearly cost him any kind of chance at a happy ever after with her. I liked the fact that he owned his mistakes and learned from them. He is obviously a good dad. Jacob is a wonderful young man and now Phoenix has to decide if taking a chance on Riley is worth the price she may ultimately pay. I loved this couple and the hero, was real life hero. He wasn't a lot of put on and bravado, he was simply a real man.Bottom Line:You can't really go wrong with a Brenda Novak book. She is at the top of her field. She writes romances that are realistic and heart felt. Her characters are multi-layered and complex. This isn't just your average boy meets girl and falls in love story. This Heart of Mine will really tug on those heartstrings and it won't be easy to put down. With amazing characters and great attention to detail, Novak puts out another stunner. A great book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HMSC5JMUPM1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778316726#wasThisHelpful","R1HMSC5JMUPM1H","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Jory has been held captive for the last two years at the very facility his brothers escaped from. The Commander is, well still in command. I liked the fact that Piper, a hacker, has no idea she is working for the wrong side. She believes she is trying to help Jory, when in fact things are not quite what she thinks.I loved the connection between Piper and Jory. Jory was one of those alpha male characters that puts his all into everything from trying to be reunited with his brothers to his love and respect for Piper. When he fought he put it all out there. When he loved he loved he was all in. Zanetti gives readers a character that is both strong and passionate. I also liked the fact that Piper was intelligent and self reliant. These two characters together were fiery and stormy. The sexual chemistry was really hot... no pun intended.Bottom Line:This book was a very well written romantic suspense with military overtones. I thought the premise for the entire series was top notch and Zanetti brings it all to life in such an amazing way. The reunion of the brothers was pretty awesome and the relationship between Jory and Piper was everything I wanted in a good romantic suspense novel. I can't say enough good things about this one. If you haven't tried this series you are really missing out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DT8WVHSOOH8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455574503#wasThisHelpful","R1DT8WVHSOOH8B","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laura Bradford returns to Heavenly, Pennsylvania in her latest Amish mystery, Suspendered Sentence. Readers who love Amish fiction won't be able to put this one down, as the skeleton of a young Amish bride is found after a fire. This story has a lot of heart and the emotions of the characters are strong and can be felt by anyone who reads it. Bradford does an excellent job with both characterization and the mystery elements of the story, but where she really shines, is in the treatment of the Amish culture and lifestyle. A great addition to the series!There are so many things that I like about this series. As always I feel like Bradford has an empathy with for Amish people. She somehow has an understanding of who they are why they do the things they do. Mysteries are founded on motivations and the whys and wherefores of a crime and I think it essential with an Amish tale that the author can kind of get into the mind of those involved. Bradford is able to do this easily and the emotions and actions of her characters seem realistic an authentic.One of the things I love about the Amish community is just that, their sense of community. They protect each other, help each other and share in the joys and sorrows of all their members from young to the old. The barn raising depicted in Suspendered Sentence is something I remember from childhood and it is crucial to the story, since that is where the remains of the young Amish woman are found. That is one of those events that draws in the community, Amish or otherwise. It is a show of solidarity and unity and I think that is huge in this culture.The mystery was poignant and very engaging. The Amish bride who died was thought to have just run away and that made it all the more mysterious. I thought Bradford did a great job of tying in the girl's diary and tying her to several of the people in heroine, Claire's life. It gave Claire the motivation to investigate. Jakob's involvement, as always, was amazing. I really like him as a character and Bradford shows even more depth to his character in each book. The clues were not easy to follow and involved more than one death, but eventually the reader will thoroughly surprised by the outcome. Claire's life is never a breeze, but she still finds time for her family and friends and is a wonderful cozy heroine.Bottom Line:Laura Bradford has a knack for writing about the Amish lifestyle and culture. She is able to get to the heart of the Amish community and bring out some of the qualities and features readers may not know about them. I loved the barn raising theme and the addition of the girl's diary was a great way to get inside the head of the victim. This was my favorite of the series so far and I think readers will get a lot more out of this than just a mystery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3WZ3IDSNNEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425273024#wasThisHelpful","R3E3WZ3IDSNNEF","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Connie Archer brings readers the fourth book in her Soup Lover's mystery series, Ladle to the Grave. In this book readers get two for the price of one, since there is more than one murder for soup restaurant owner, Lucky to solve. Readers looking for a charming small town mystery with reoccurring characters and plenty of mayhem will love this one. Archer has an eye for detail and her characters both villains and heroes are well drawn and easy to relate to. A great addition to this very popular series!Snowflake, Vermont is the kind of New England small town I've always dreamed of living in, minus the murders that do seem to occur on occasion. Archer brings Snowflake to life with her vivid imagery and details. Readers know everything about this little town, from the details in the lives of it's citizens to the descriptions of the shops and places that make the town seem so real. Archer shows us how important the right setting can be for a mystery series.Lucky is as always very protective of her family and her friends. In Ladle to the Grave she has to deal with suspicion being thrown on not only her grandfather, but her best friend Sophie as well. Two murder's instead of the customary one in cozy mysteries, makes the reader feel like they really get their money's worth with this one. Not only is the mystery well thought out and executed, the reader is able to discover the clues right along with Lucky. It didn't wrap up to quickly and it wasn't too apparent who the villain or villains could be. A complex but very entertaining mystery.One of the parts that I like best in this series are the reoccurring characters. We get to learn new details in every book about Lucky and her family, her doctor boyfriend and other members of the community. In this one we get to see the planning of Sophie's wedding to the chef at Lucky's restaurant. It was fun to check in with everyone and find out what was new. Archer always makes it a good visit with old friends as well as a top notch mystery.Bottom Line:This is one of my favorite cozy mystery series. Archer's eye of detail makes the setting come alive and the people of Snowflake seem like old friends. You two mysteries wrapped up in one in this one and there's plenty going on in town to give the readers even more to like about it. A great addition to the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFH4T6ONOMDHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425273113#wasThisHelpful","RFH4T6ONOMDHC","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever wonder what your dog or cat is thinking? Laura Morrigan's heroine, Grace doesn't need to, she's an animal psychic who can communicate with her clients. Horse of a Different Killer, the latest book in the Call of the Wilde series, and readers will not only love the animal/human interactions, as well as, the mystery surrounding the death of Grace's ex-brother-in-law. If you love animals and mysteries this series has got it going on. A good addition to the series!I always love seeing a new book in this series come out. Laura Morrigan gives the series a hint of the paranormal as the heroine can telepathically talk to animals, but she doesn't go overboard with it. If you think about it, this was a really risky idea for the author. There was the chance that Grace's abilities could come off as cheesy or unbelievable, but Morrigan is really able to ride that fine line between a good theme and a bad joke. Grace's interactions with the animals put into her path are not always informative, but they do seem necessary to the story and not what I would call filler. It wasn't just a scheme to add something new to a cozy series, it was well thought out and planned. Well done!This time Grace's sister is fingered for the crime of killing her ex. What better reason can a sleuth have to investigate than proving a loved one's innocence. Grace and her sister are light night and day. So very different from each other, that they compliment each other. There interactions are fun to read and endearing. If I lived with my sister I would probably pull my hair out.. but these two make it work and Grace has to find the real killer to get her sister out of hot water here and it all worked well. I thought Morrigan not only gave readers a good mystery but a great story of family love as well.Bottom Line:The mystery in this one was strong. Morrigan had me in the dark for much of the book. I didn't figure it out as quickly as I would have liked, but that made it all the more satisfying when I did. I love Grace and her unique way of investigating. If anyone really knows what happened it's probably the furry friends who nobody thinks about. The missing horse from which the name is taken was a big part of the story, but the fainting goat... stole the show! A good addition to a unique and different series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23C05G6XIQBTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425257215#wasThisHelpful","R23C05G6XIQBTP","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maeve Greyson brings readers the first book in her new Highland Heart's historical time travel romance series, My Highland Lover. Reader's who love historical romances, but also love the paranormal will fall in love with this kind of romance. There is a little bit of time travel, a little bit of magic and even a little bit of murder. Greyson's sense of imagery and descriptive prose is wonderful. Reader's will feel as though they have been transported right along with the heroine, Trulie into 13th century Scotland. A great start to a new series!I love Scotland, sooo much! I love the place, I love the legends. I love movies about it. But, I especially love books about it. When an author gets it right when it comes to Scotland, I feel very satisfied for them. The Highland spirit is sometimes very hard to capture on paper and I think Maeve Greyson did a wonderful job with that. From the Scottish brogue to the authentic setting and customs, Greyson proves that she did her homework. And reading it made me like Scotland even more.Trulie isn't really a true Kentucky girl, but I did love the fact that Greyson's modern day setting was in my home state. As a heroine Trulie didn't strike a perfect cord with me, she seemed a bit reluctant to return to the 13th century but she eventually grew on me. I thought Greyson's time travel elements were unique and well drawn, not your average time machine for sure. Trulie was a good match for her Highland hero when she finally got used to the idea.Gray was pretty amazing. I loved the way he talked, the way he acted and just about everything about him. The mystery surrounding the death of his parents added a different layer to the story and I think Greyson did gave readers more than just a romance here. Gray was a very sexy hero and the intimate moments he and Trulie share together were sultry and passionate. He was a good leader to his people and he proved he could go with the flow when a girl drops out of the sky and practically into his lap.Bottom Line:This was a very well written Highland romance, with the added mystery surrounding Gray's parents and the time travel elements. There was something here for a lot of different kinds of readers. Mystery, romance, paranormal elements, Greyson gives us all of them and more, even a little bit of humor coming from the matchmaking efforts of Granny and her friends. This was a great start to a new series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J9XFRUDSN4FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PD7E2#wasThisHelpful","R1J9XFRUDSN4FB","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Megan Erickson brings readers the first book in a new series, Trust the Focus. This is a new adult novel with a m/m lead couple. Erickson gives readers a lot to focus on in this one, from the grief of losing a parent to the confusion of not being able to meet the expectations of people around you. This is a book about discovery, exploration and figuring out who you really want to be. It also dealt with sexual orientation and figuring out what you are passionate about in life. Erickson hits it out of the park with this sultry coming of age story!I wasn't too sure what to expect with this one. I will have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I was skeptical about reading a book with a m/m lead couple. I have read books where m/m relationships are secondary but not the main focus of the story and I was worried it would not be my cup of tea. I do believe that love is something we can't take for granted in life no matter we may find it. Erickson surprised me with her realistic and poignant portrayal of a young man on the brink of taking his next step in life. She made me believe in Justin's exploration of his life and his sexuality. This part of the book was very well written and very entertaining.Justin was such a wonderful main character. It was easy to feel not only his grief over losing his beloved father but his passion for photography. It was not just a past time for him and loved the way he honored his father's memory by scattering his ashes in the places he loved to photograph. I thought Erickson excelled with her character development. Justin came across as a young man, with a good head on his shoulders, but one who was expected to live a life he didn't believe in. Erickson really worked hard to show the way that Justin was feeling and the reader will be able to feel it as well.Landry was a gem as well. He was one of those friends who is happy to be right there with you no matter what the circumstances are. He obviously loved Justin and his father. I liked the fact that he let Justin make his own decisions. Nothing felt forced or unnecessary. He just let him figure it out on his own and waited in the wings. I thought they made a great couple and the love scenes were scorching. Landry was a real lover and he understood that he needed to put Justin first. It was a beautiful romance. Very well done.Bottom Line:Justin's problem with his mom was a hard thing. Anyone wants to make their parents proud. But Justin just did not want what she wanted for him. It was nice to see him find his courage to live the life he wanted to live. I loved his connection to his father and how much he meant to him and I loved the photography aspect of the story. But most of all the romance between Justin and Landry was sexy and heart warming. There will be tears with this one. Be prepared.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37P712WLOJGW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGLZPU#wasThisHelpful","R37P712WLOJGW1","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebecca M. Hale returns to her Cats and Curios series with her latest book, How to Catch a Cat. Rupert and Isabella are back with another adventure, this time centering around the sailing history of San Francisco. Hale's unique way of writing might be a little confusing for some, but she always creates a tale that is complex and satisfying and this one is no exception. The unnamed main character is trying to find a killer in her own time and one in the past, which takes the reader on a journey through time as well as through a good mystery. Readers who love this series will find this one irresistible.This series is a mystery within itself. The idea that the main character is never named in the series, took a little bit of getting used to. At first I found that hard to digest, but the idea has grown on me. It is a really unique concept and Hale certainly makes it work for her in this series. Readers are fascinated as much by Rupert and Isabella's ""person"" as they are by whatever is going on in the story. I wonder every time I read one of the books in this series, if we'll ever really find out her name.I loved the sailing history theme of this addition to the series. Hale always does her homework and ensures that no two books she has written are anything alike. Her themes are distinctive and often take the reader into areas they never considered before. San Francisco is obviously a sailing town. I have to wonder how much of the historical stuff that Hale gives us in this book is based on real fact. It makes me want to go beyond the book and do a little research of my own. That's a hallmark of a good author.Essentially, the lead character, along with her uncle and her two cats are trying to pinpoint not one but two killers, separated by time. The present day killer's nickname is the Knitting Needle Ninja due to her choice of weapon. It was a little hard to distinguish whether you were in the past or the present at times and it was one of those books you had to really think about and concentrate on. But I think that was part of the beauty of it. I didn't want a mystery I could solve easily. I wanted to work for it and Hale delivered on that aspect.Bottom Line:Rupert and Isabella once again steal the show. We still don't know the main characters name and Uncle Oscar is still alive unbeknownst to most of the characters in the book. This was a somewhat complicated tale that took a lot of twists and turns. I loved the sailing history. I liked the fact that you had a mystery within a mystery to solve and the way the story skipped from the past to the present. A very unique and satisfying addition to this popular series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MGWD2RZN7YMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425258882#wasThisHelpful","R1MGWD2RZN7YMM","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Crystal Green brings readers the third book in her Rough and Tumble series, Hot and Bothered. This is a second chance romance set in and around, Sin City. Readers looking for a unique setting, intriguing characters or something to get them all hot and bothered need look no further. This book has a cowboy sort of essence about it that will make readers think of handsome heroes with big hearts and they won't be disappointed. Green develops some wonderful characters that will warm the heart and make a reader swoon now and then. A good addition to the series.This is my first book from Crystal Green's Rough and Tumble series. I think I misinterpreted what the book was going to be about from the cover and the blurb to some extent, but that was a happy mistake. I had this notion that it was basically a western romance and it wasn't really that kind of book. It was unique for a lot of reasons. The hero isn't really a cowboy, so to speak, but a bodyguard for hire and a very good one at that. Just outside of Las Vegas there was a definite call for that kind of work. The heroine is a author, which was a nice call by the author. Readers love authors and that was nice with this one.Gideon was what I would call a player. He had a lot of different women and he doesn't settle down at all. But I honestly thought that was all a front to some extent. He had feelings for Rochelle a long time ago and when she left, he was afraid to get close to anyone. He uses that swagger and over confident attitude to keep real feelings away. I liked watching him come undone when he and Rochelle have to work together again. She needs protection and he is protecting kind of man. The fact that he was a bodyguard was a natural fit for the character. He made a sexy hero.Rochelle was an author with a fair amount of success, but she managed to ruffle a few feathers along the way and now she needs a bodyguard for her upcoming book tour. Since Gideon is one of the best she is forced to see him again and it's very quickly apparent that the sparks are still there. I liked Rochelle, she was smart and sassy and she was also lonely. I was nice to see her get a second chance with Gideon. I thought the author did a good job of coming up with a great way to put them back together again.Having said that, I did love the characters, but there were a few other things about the book that I didn't like as much. For me the pacing was way off. The first half of the book was slow to start and hard to read at times because it just didn't seem to be going anywhere. The lead characters danced around each other and the danger that Rochelle was facing. I felt like I had to drag the action out of the book. Somewhere around the half way mark the story started to pick up and it finished strong, but you really have to stick with it. To say this one has a slow start is probably an understatement.I liked Gideon a lot as a character, but I did think there was a pretty big discrepancy in the kind of person the author wanted us to think he was and the kind of persons his actions were showing us in the early part of the book. I don't think you have to sleep with everyone  of the opposite sex who has a pulse to prove that you are good in bed or that you are irresistible. It is also not necessary to prove you are a real man, or whatever. I just think that was a little much for my tastes. A hero needs to be a hero and it took me a few minutes to figure that out with this one.Bottom Line:I liked this book. I had a hard time getting started because of the slow beginning. I also thought there was a bit of a disconnect between who the hero was and how he presented himself. Beyond that it was a very good second chance love story. I liked watching Gideon change into that man I wanted him to be, but I think he could have been there from the beginning. Rochelle was great, but she did have a penchant for cold feet. All in all it was a good effort, just maybe not the best this author can do. I'm going to read the other books in the series to see if my opinion might be a little skewed just from this book. As always take with a grain of salt, read it for yourself and let me know what you think!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UEPJWAB1LDFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9F0U2O#wasThisHelpful","R1UEPJWAB1LDFW","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Debut author Sandra Lake takes historical fiction to new heights with her first book in the Sons of the North series, The Warlord's Wife. Readers who enjoy historical fiction but are tired of the same old offerings will find this book a refreshing change. Lake gives readers a look into the Viking culture and history like they've never seen it before, through the eyes of a young woman, touched by tragedy. The Swedes that Lake writes about are a strong and noble people who brave the cold and inhospitable North to raise there families and live their lives. A great new series!Sandra Lake went back to her roots in writing this novel. Being from Sweden she had a unique perspective that translated well in her first novel. The Warlord's Wife had an authenticity and realness that readers don't always find in historical fiction. Readers who are tired of the ton, will love the great white North. I thought Lake did a fantastic job of showing the setting and making the reader aware of the kind of people it takes to live in this kind of environment. The historical background was well researched and well written.Being a debut novel, I generally expect a few hiccups and that was the case with this book as well. There were moments when the pacing was a little off, some spots read very quickly, with lots of action and things going on, while other parts of the story drug a little bit and moved too slowly. I think that's just one of those things you learn along the way. I'm sure that Lake will perfect her timing and balance as she matures as a writer.I also felt like there were some issues with the intimacy between the characters. I realize that Lida has had a difficult journey in her life and that she isn't sure she wants to be the Jarl. But once they began to get closer I expected a little more from the romantic scenes. I wanted it to be about more than producing a male heir. It was, but it didn't have that feeling that some romances give you.That being said, there were a lot of things to like with this book as well. I loved the interactions between both Lida and her daughter Katia, and the Warlord and Katia. It was easy to see that the Jarl had not been taught the value of women, other than to produce children. It was amazing to watch how he transforms throughout the book. He becomes that hero that you want him to be. He had a great journey and I think Lake did a great job with character development.There was a lot of action in this book centering around the fact that the Warlord's family was not satisfied with his choice in a wife and were quick to cause trouble at every turn. I liked the back and forth between the family members and Lida and her husband. I was glad to see him take her side and be that man he needed to be.Bottom Line:This was a good book. I liked it a lot. It was a break from Regency England in the historical romance genre. Which made it unique and refreshing. The historical background was amazing and the author did a superb job with characterization. I did stumble a bit with the pacing and I felt the romance was slightly lacking, but there is a lot of potential here and I think readers are going to want to watch Sandra Lake as she matures as a writer. A very good start to a new series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y22JP69JHMYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV0YW8G#wasThisHelpful","R1Y22JP69JHMYB","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Laura Wright continues her riveting tale of murder and love in the third book in the Cavanaugh Brothers series, Brash. This series has an ongoing story arc involving the murder of the sister of the Cavanaugh boys that is gripping and immensely interesting. In this addition to the series, we meet Cole. He is the twin brother to Cassie who was murdered before the series begins. Wright does a wonderful job of keeping up the suspense and offering just enough clues to keep the reader on the hook. A great addition to this already spectacular series.Brash is probably my favorite of this series so far and I probably say that about every book that comes out in the series. Wright just gets better and better with each book. Cole is the Cavanaugh brother that I have been most intrigued about throughout the series, always in the shadows and not willing to be a part of anything, Cole has been a real mystery up until this book. I loved learning about him and his MMA career. He has taken all the pain and loss he feels from Cass's death and found a way to make others hurt. It was easy to see him pouring out his rage and pain, he was the epitome of a tortured hero.Grace is perfect for him. She has a very loving nature and she has went out of the way to protect her ailing father who investigated Cass's murder all those years ago. He's hiding something, but it's hard to sort out the facts. His mental state is far from credible. But something about Cole speaks to Grace and she wants to help him. She has been approached by the other Cavanaugh brothers and none of them has been able to get her to help them, but there is something about Cole. I liked the way she was with him. Very loving and caring, no matter how he acted. I was glad that she finally decided to help the boys and even in the longer run help her father.Bottom Line:This is a really great book in a really great series. The mystery is both compelling and entertaining to try to figure out. Wright gives you just enough information in each book about the murder to keep you coming back for more. Each hero is a little different than the last, but I had a soft spot for Cole, he was a tortured hero and really held up to the name. The best one in the series so far, you don't want to miss it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJK2N4KLZWPIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451465083#wasThisHelpful","RJK2N4KLZWPIX","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Judi Fennell brings readers the fourth book in her Manley Maids series, What a Woman. This has been a very enjoyable series with a great premise, a meddling grandmother and four siblings not exactly looking for love. Fennell does a great job of giving readers a light hearted romance that will keep them laughing until the very end. Mac Manley, the only girl in the bunch finally gets her story in What a Woman and readers will really enjoy this high school crush turned romance. A great addition to the series!There is so much to love about this series. First of all the premise was great. A sister and her grandmother forcing her brothers to not only clean houses as part of a bet, but to also find true love. I love it when matchmaking involves the extended family. This was a great idea and I think it panned out very well for Fennell. I'm glad that not only the boys get their stories and happy endings but Mac as well. She has been an enjoyable secondary character throughout the series and really shines here.Mac is feisty and full of sass. I've liked that about her character from the beginning. She not only catches her brother in bet, but she seems to know exactly where to send them to get the most for her money. It was nice to see more of her backstory here and learn about her school girl crush on Jared. I liked their banter and the romantic tension in the air when they were together here. She doesn't back down from him and he isn't about to let her get the upper hand in the relationship... so much fun.Jared is a handsome former baseball player and he's lonely. He has spent a lot of time with women who didn't appreciate him or wanted to run all over him and when Mac shows up to get his grandmother's house ready for sale, the fight is on. It was fun watching them together and in spite of treating Mac badly when he was younger he comes off as a genuinely nice guy, especially with the puppies, yes I said, puppies.Bottom Line:A very enjoyable addition to this series. What a Woman met all my expectations for a story about Mac, the feisty sister. She was a great character and deserved her own happy ending. I liked Jared a lot too but the best part was the easy banter and enjoyment they got from each other. There was a little bit of steam and some unusual antics with a condom that will have readers in giggle fits. A great addition to the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38IFR37F7RV1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425268322#wasThisHelpful","R38IFR37F7RV1E","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jessica Fletcher and Donald Bain are at it again with the forty-first novel in the Murder She Wrote series, Aloha Betrayed. Fans of the old television show will love Jessica's take on Hawaii in this book. With details about everything from plant life to culture this book is a traveler's dream, but it borders on getting lost in the details, instead of the mystery. Perhaps not my favorite of the Murder She Wrote books, but still a solid installment in a long lived series.Jessica is at it again, this time in Hawaii. I liked the fact that the author was able to give Jessica a reason to be in the state that was believable. I could just see Jessica giving a lecture on just this topic or something similar. I always loved her forthright and upfront manner when it came to solving mysteries and that is exactly what readers get in this installment of the series. Aloha Betrayed is clue-based and the reader is able to follow the evidence just like the heroine. Unfortunately, this one leaned a little further away from the mystery aspects of the book and centered more on Hawaii itself.This would have made a great story about the state of Hawaii, it's landmarks, things to do, places to see, etc. But it was supposed to be a cozy mystery. Don't get me wrong there was a murder and Jessica did solve it, but the bulk of the materiel in the book was not related to that part of the book. So the balance was way off. I think it's great to set a good scene and draw the reader in, but an author can sometimes go a little overboard and I think that's what happened here.Bottom Line:This one is just a bit slow and a little underdeveloped. I wanted more character involvement and stronger connections to each clue. I didn't want to know as much about the flora and fauna as I did about 'whodunit'. It wasn't predictable, just not up to the usual standard of this series. I hope for more with the next one, because I'm sure this writing duo has a lot more stories to tell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DMJTUGC8YA96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451466551#wasThisHelpful","R1DMJTUGC8YA96","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ah... unrequited love. That's exactly what Marie Force gives her readers with the latest Green Mountain novel, And I Love Her. Hunter, the eldest of the Abbott siblings is all business until he gets the opportunity to woo the girl of his dreams, literally. This hero is all buttoned up, quiet and reluctant to flip the boat in a lot of ways, but Force shows great character development as she lets Megan show Hunter how to let his hair down. This is a feel good romance with a whole lot of heat. Force knows a thing or two about a good love scene and readers will reap the benefits. A great new novel in the Green Mountain series!I have loved this series from the very first book. There is just something about the Abbott family that hits the spot for me. Hunter is the oldest of ten... count'em... ten siblings. This is one big happy family and they are comical, quarrelsome, meddling and all that good stuff that comes from having so many siblings. Not only do their parents get in on all the fun but so does everybody else. I love the family dynamic that Force has created here and I think fans of the series are hoping that all ten siblings get their happy endings because readers won't want to leave Green Mountain, any other way.Hunter made an interesting hero. He isn't quite the blue collar worker that most of the Abbott's have turned out to be. He a little more straight laced, with a GQ style and more reserved personality. He has born the burden of helping his parents raise their big brood and it shows. He just doesn't have a real good concept of how to let loose and have a good time, but Megan is quick to show him how and I loved that about their relationship. Hunter really blossoms for lack of a better word. He gets more comfortable with himself and the possibility of finding love as the story progresses. It was nice to watch him open up and let love in.Megan was a bit more of a harder sell for me. First of all she's been in love with Will for years and now that Will has found the love of his life, she just all the sudden switches to a different brother? I kind of felt like that wasn't the best way to go about this one. I sympathized with family struggles and the fact that she was finding her way in the world alone. That's a hard thing and perhaps that made her a little harder to understand as a character. I just wasn't sure she was the choice I would have made for Hunter, but they did have good chemistry and their love scenes were pretty spicy. Force didn't necessarily make me dislike Megan, but she didn't make me love her either.Bottom Line:This another great romance from Marie Force. She has proven time and again that she is in her wheelhouse with small town romances. The Abbott family is a joy to read about and I find myself wondering what meddlesome adventure they are going to get into next. I have a rather big family by the time it's all said and done and we can be quite a lot like this bunch. A great set of characters. Hunter was a great hero, but Megan didn't quite resonate with me.

This is a great second chance love story that will grip the reader from the first page to the last. The author uses several different analogies to other classic pieces of literature to bring about a story that is both compelling and endearing. If you are looking for one of those books that makes you want to tear you hair out one minutes and cry your eyes out the next, this one is perfect for you! A great start to a new series!This is my first book by Kelly Moran and I'll have to say, I was impressed with several different things about this book. I liked the way Moran harkens back to stories like Cinderella, and Jane Eyre to give her novel both a ring of the familiarity, and a touch of that fairy tale like nostalgia. Mia is the daughter of the maid when rich boy Cole Covington meets her. Though the sparks fly and they become an instant couple, Mia doesn't meet the expectations of his family. Later on after several years have passed, Cole returns home from the military wounded in both body and spirit and Mia returns to care for him in order to pay the bills and take care of her sister. Definite parallels to both classic pieces. I loved that about this book.The characters were also so compelling and entertaining. From the very first chapter readers will fall in love with Cole and start to root for him to find his happy ending. It's obvious that the war in Iraq has taken his will to live and he comes across as a very tortured hero. I always like a hero that has a little more at stake than just finding Miss Right. Cole needs to mend his spirit as much as his body and that adds a totally different dimension to that part of the novel.Mia is also just a wonderfully developed and deep character. She is very selfless and takes good care of her sister. She sacrifices so much for her family that readers won't can't help but fall in love with her. Watching her care for someone she felt had betrayed her was a joy. She was still compassionate and caring in spite of what happened between her and Cole and I found myself really admiring her as a character. I think Moran did an excellent job with characterization all the way around and that made this just a really good read.Bottom Line:This is a book that will speak to a lot of people. I love a military hero and this was super special. I think readers will appreciate Cole's story and be able to relate to his reasons for betraying Mia in the first place. Doing what your family expects of you is a big thing and even though it screwed up his life, he was changed by that decision and it affected everything after. I loved this one. A great chance to get in at the beginning on a what will probably be a great series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20SN08T4L2H3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425276872#wasThisHelpful","R20SN08T4L2H3V","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leslie Budewitz brings reads the first in a new cozy mystery series, Assault and Pepper. This is the first book in the Spice Shop Mystery series and may prove to be quite a favorite for cozy readers. Everything for the trendy Seattle setting to the robust and soothing spiced tea from the Seattle Spice Shop was enjoyable in this book. Budewitz introduces readers to a wonderful new heroine in Pepper Reece and gives them a intriguing and eclectic range of secondary characters. A great first effort in a new series!I really loved Leslie Budewitz' Food Lovers series and was excited to see what she had to offer in this new series. I don't know about you, but one of the favorite things in my kitchen is my spice rack. I love to use it and I loved seeing how Budewitz decided to use spice in this series. A very interesting idea for a cozy series. Not only do we have regular spices that everyone might know but Budewitz also gives readers spiced tea and different kinds of recipes that are sure to have readers heading for the kitchen, book in hand.One of the things that made this book so good was the setting. Seattle is one of those iconic cities that readers and foodies alike know for it's rainy days and wonderful markets and sights. Budewitz does Seattle justice in this book, making the reader smell the aromas and taste the wonderful offerings from the shops in Pike Place Market. I think Budewitz did her homework her and it played to her advantage. A fantastic setting for a new series.Pepper Reece is the new heroine for this series. She was once a corporate HR manager in a stifled marriage with a cheating husband. Now she has her own business and a new life. But the past doesn't seem to be too far away since Tag, her ex-husband is cop whose beat happens to be around Pepper's Spice Shop. I thought Pepper was amazing as a new heroine, though I wanted to shake her a time to two to point out a possible clue, but eventually she got it and it all same to a satisfying end. I liked her attitude and her resourcefulness. A great new heroine.The mystery aspect of the story centered around a dead homeless man who ended up on the doorstep of Pepper's shop and one of her employee's is nabbed for the murder. I thought Budewitz did a good job of giving Pepper reason and opportunity to investigate. I wasn't too keen on the fact that her ex-husband becomes an important character due to being a cop in the area. I thought that just didn't work, because of trust issues. The homeless denizens of the Pike Place Market were a bit too stereo-typical for me as well. Having lived in a city where there was a high population of homeless people, I have learned that there is far more to the story than most people ever know about them.Bottom Line:I did have a couple of moments of pause, in Budewitz' descriptions of the homeless population around the Pike Place Market and in her references to Pepper's relationship with her ex-husband, but all in all I really liked this book and I think that Budewitz will continue to give readers a lot to look forward to with this series. I think it was a great first effort in a series and I'm looking forward to what comes next for Pepper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R277LRME7HB0OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425271781#wasThisHelpful","R277LRME7HB0OO","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tracy Anne Warren begins a new Regency series, with her latest novel, The Bedding Proposal. The first book in the Rakes of Cavendish Square series, pits a bored aristocrat against a woman with a reproachful reputation. Warren excels in her knowledge of the times and actions of the ton. She transports readers back in time with ease. The book has an authenticity that is often missing in some historical romances. Warren brings both heat and sentimentality to this story of wronged woman and a Lord who just doesn't seem to care. A great first in a series book!I have read Tracy Anne Warrens contemporary romance books, but had never read any of her historical novels before this one. A fact that shall be remedied quickly. The Rakes of Cavendish Square is basically a spin off from her Byrons of Braebourne series. Leo the hero, in The Bedding proposal is a prominent secondary character in that series and finally gets his story told here. After reading this book it is a given that I will go back and pick up the other Byron series. I thought she did a great job with contemporary romance but I admit I like her historical's even better.Lord Leo Byron is a fifth son in a prominent English family. He has his life pretty well laid out for him. But something is missing. His family has quite the reputation and he doesn't think anything of perhaps taking on a new mistress. What he didn't expect was to fall in love with his new prospect. Lady Thalia basically turned him on his head from the very beginning of the story. He was more than just smitten at first sight, he was down right in serious lust. It was almost comical to read how much he wanted Thalia and how she thwarted him at every turn. She wasn't necessarily playing hard to get. She meant it. Which was refreshing for a woman of the times.I liked both Leo and Thalia's characters very much. I liked the fact that Leo didn't give a darn about what the ton thought of him or what gossip was being spread about Thalia and her former husband. He liked this woman and he didn't care who knew it. Thalia was something else. She had a wicked reputation but none of it was really warranted. Warren wrote her as a very capable woman, who knew what she wanted. Leo just kept at it though, wearing her down. The sparks between them were amazing. This was such a well written Regency.One of the things I liked most about this one was the fact that Warren seemed to really know and understand the time period she was writing about. I like it when an author pushes the boundaries of what was acceptable, but I don't want them to go overboard and I felt like Warren was in touch with that. She got close to the lines but she kept it in the lane. I wasn't surprised that she allowed Thalia and Leo to have a relationship outside of marriage, because this was acceptable for women who were divorced during that time. It may not have been publicized but it was within the realm of the Regency character. I just thought she did a great job of bringing the customs of the time to the forefront, while giving the reader all the juicy details.Bottom Line:I really liked this one. I thought Warren's ability to set the scene and adhere to the times was excellent. Her characters were believable and not your typical Regency fare. I liked the fact that Thalia was a divorcee and played by a different set of rules. Leo was a great hero, confident and determined and the heat between them was immense and satisfying. Warren gave me everything was looking for a great Regency novel. Oh, whoa is me, now I want to read everything else she's ever written.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SNUY839GMAX4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469224#wasThisHelpful","R2SNUY839GMAX4","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kendra Leigh Castle brings readers the second book in her Harvest Cove series, Every Little Kiss. This is a light-hearted romance that will have reading smiling. With a buttoned up heroine and a military hero, turned cop, there had to be some serious sparks. Castle does a great job with the small town setting and readers will love the quirky characters and down home charm. If you are looking for a great feel good story, this is it!This was my first book by this author. There are a few things I look for when reading someone new and in this case, Castle met all my criteria for an author I'd want to read again and again. First of all, she charms readers with her small town setting for this series. Harvest Cove is one of those little New England towns that people dream about living in. With quirky, off-beat townspeople and that sense of community and forthrightness.Secondly, Castle provided great characters who showed a lot of growth throughout the story. The heroine is a buttoned up event planner that really needed to let her hair down, but when she did, she ended up with one of the local cops. I liked the fact that Emma changes so much from the beginning of this book to the end. She is so straight laced and hard to please and then with the help of Seth's caring and playfulness she blossoms. Seth was a great hero in every sense of he word. I liked that he was former military and that he was looking for a slow pace of life. Both characters were realistic and fun to read about.My last criteria for a good romance, is often the steaminess of the relationship. It's funny, in some books I really want the heat to be high and intense and in some books, depending on how the story has progressed, I just want that slow easy kind of love scene and that's what readers get with this one. It's relatively clean and certainly will put a smile on your face, but it doesn't go overboard which would have completely changed the dynamic of the book.Bottom Line:I would definitely read this author again. I think that her character development was excellent. The setting was well written and played an essential part in the story. The love scenes fit the story and were not too intense. This would appeal to readers who are looking for a good, well written feel-good romance. It wasn't too complicated and it made me smile. Well done!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SK3TJBRQQMDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451467590#wasThisHelpful","R2SK3TJBRQQMDT","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christy Fifield returns to Keyhole Bay, Florida and Glory Martine's souvenir shop, in the latest Haunted Souvenir Shop mystery, Murder Ties the Knot. Fans of the series will love Karen and Riley's wedding, while keeping their fingers crossed that Beth and Everett stay out of jail in this one. Fifield's strength in this series is her zany cast of characters. Readers looking for a series that has both mystery and personality will love it!Southern Treasures is a quaint little shop in Florida, but it's winter time and business is slow, the perfect time for not only a wedding, but a murder mystery. Fifield has given her heroine, Glory Martine a bit of a break from murder, but it isn't long before she's back in business. I liked the fact that Fifield doesn't have Glory investigating one murder right after the other, sometimes in cozy writing you have to wonder how many murders are going to occur in one small town. Fifield seems to have a good grasp on just how far she can take that aspect of her writing without going overboard.Readers of the series have been waiting for Karen and Riley's wedding and they won't be disappointed. Glory has some interesting friends and family and it's always fun to check in with them and see what's going on. I liked all the wedding plans and details and Karen wouldn't be Karen without a little reporting on the side. I liked the fact that even though she was super busy, she still had time to help Glory investigate.With a double murder on her plate, you'd think Glory would be up to eyeballs in clues alone, but there is a lot more going on in Glory's life than just investigating. She's trying to buy out her lowly cousin Peter's part of her shop, she is trying to find the money to expand, all while trying to keep two innocent people out of jail. The personal aspects of the story are a real plus in this novel. It isn't all about the murder, it's about the lives of these characters as well. Always a good point in a cozy.The mystery part of the book was stellar. I liked how all the puzzle pieces fit together, even if you had to do a bit of searching and twisting to make them fit. Fifield always treats her readers to a well thought out mystery that will keep them guessing throughout. Just enough red herrings to keep them off the track and when you look back at the end you'll wonder why in the world you didn't see it!Bottom Line:Another great cozy offering from Christy Fifield. This an author with a bright future in the genre. She knows what readers want to know about. Not only the details of the crime, but the life of the heroine and those she interacts with. It's a great balance of mystery and personality that readers won't want to miss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJ04CV85HAJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425279243#wasThisHelpful","R1PJ04CV85HAJ2","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Susan Mallery brings readers the first book in a new series featuring three women and a friendship that withstands the struggles of everyday life. The Girls of Mischief Bay aren't really girls at all, they are three women from three different walks of life, who don't let age or circumstance dictate their friendship. Mallery gives readers a stunning setting in the small coastal California town of Mischief Bay and she gives them a story of both hope and loss. A great new book, from a trusted romance author!Susan Mallery is one my guilty pleasure authors. Her books always seem to lift my spirits and put me in a different frame of mind. The Girls of Mischief Bay is certainly that kind of book. Mallery is all about friendship in this novel. There is something about the friendships between women that is really intriguing to me and such a wonderful experience. Mallery is able to capture that bond that is so hard to define and the women in this story possess it. I thought the way they stood up for each other and helped each other was a beautiful thing.Not only is this a story of true friendship it is also about the changing stages of life. Each woman in the book is faced with some kind of situation or decision that will redefine how she looks at herself and at the world in general. Mallery makes her readers take a close look at their lives through these women. What changes do you need to make in your life to ensure your happiness? What do you do when tragedy strikes? How can you keep the spice in your marriage? There are lots of questions for these ladies and it was amazing watching them take the steps they needed to start new chapters in their stories.Nicole is dealing with a husband who isn't contributing to the family in much of any way. Pam is trying to bring the spice back into her marriage and Shannon is realizing that having a top notch career isn't everything in life. All three women go through a transformation in this book and I loved reading how each one of them resolves or makes the changes they need in their lives. I wanted to help even though I knew they were fictional characters. I also wanted to be friends with all of them. Mallery made them so personal and real with real struggles and losses. Great characters all around.Bottom Line:Nicole, Pam and Shannon all were fiercely loyal to each other and each of their journeys in this book. I thought that Mallery did a great job of portraying the friendship that can exist between women, while also showing readers that you can redefine your life at any age, whether that's by having a child, moving on from the past or what have you. I look forward to more books featuring these women and their friends and family. A great start to a new series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJWB6ZERNN62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317749#wasThisHelpful","R1CJWB6ZERNN62","A1RVRHXA5ARWFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RVRHXA5ARWFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is perfect for a guest room or kids room.  We used this for our son's room.  It is simple to set up, yet very well made and stable.  It allows for a simple, low height bed, with room for a bit of storage underneath.

"I have been looking for an attractive watch to wear to work, but inexpensive enought that I wont worry about it getting broken or damaged.  This watch fits that bill perfectly.It has a large face, very attractive with different appearance at various angles.  It usually seems a dark blue color, but at certain times and lighting it  changes to black.  There are stripes in the center portion of the face, but again they will vanish at certain angles and seem prominant at others.  The is a full calendar function in the dials on the watch face.  Overall, I am beyond pleased with the watch.The band is attractive, but the latch is terrible.  The best I can describe the latch is that someone tried to fix something that didnt need fixing.  You need to experiment with the actual clasp until you find the correct hole in the band to fit your wrist, then leave it alone as the clasp has a double expanding feature which allows you to remove the watch without undoing the 'normal' part of the band.  The problem is that it takes a lot of patience, or 3 hands, to set the band at the correct hole in the band and it takes NO consideration that many people need to adjust the band size throughout the day due to wrists expanding or contacting slightly.  When the band gets tight due to a little physical activity increasing my wrist diameter, the weird expanding portion of the clasp is quite painful and uncomfortable on my wrist.In short, it is an attractive watch at a great price.  You may want to get a different band for it, I am planning on it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17SGECWYVN7ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QYCJDC#wasThisHelpful","R17SGECWYVN7ZD","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To help with information security and identitiy theft protection, we needed a shredder.  This fit our needs perfectly.  It is about the size of a small desk trashcan.  It is suprisingly quiet, wont bother everyone around when you run an envelope through it.  It is easy to move with the handy carry handle.  It shreds well, not even blinking at the occasional staple or thick envelope.We keep it next to where we open the mail and pay bills.  Junk mail goes straight into the shredded, and anything else we arent keeping for our records goes through it once we are finished.  It shreds thick postard types of paper, as well as envelopes stuffed with credit card offers, even envelopes with the fake credit cards inside.When emptying the shredder, you can see that it completely destroys whatever is put into it.

"This is a nice laptop sleeve, with some drawbacks.  The main drawback is a lack of any sort of handle or carry method, if I wanted to grab my laptop and carry it around by the edge, I wouldn't need a sleeve for it.  The other drawback is the closure, the little magnet is nice, but not secure enough for something that doesn't have a carry handle or strap.Aside from those two issues, it is well built and well thought out.  There are several small pockets perfect for cords and a couple small items.I personally use this as a sleeve to hold my laptop inside of my backpack.

I spend a lot of time driving or in the sun, and can notice a difference in my skin at the end of the day on the days I use it compared to the days I dont.  I usually dont wear sunblock, even though I know I should, becuase I cant tolerate that they all either feel greasy, or make your fell 'crusty' if you use the sprays.  This is a great option since it doesnt make me feel either.If used sparingly it will last a long time, which is important since this seems to be the mose expensive sunblock ever made.

"This is a great vacuum for hard floors.  Our house is almost all tile, and we have cats, dogs, and kids, so we can really make a floor dirty quickly.

The canister holds a good amount of debris, plus it is quick and easy to empty out.  The noise level is normal compared to other vacuums.  The last noteworthy item I can think of is that it has a long cord, which is a necessity for a vacuum to be ""good"" in my opinion.

"This is a nice scent, it has a citrus like scent.  Does not have the ""chemical"" smell some seems to have recently.  The scent is not overpowering (1 spray), but last a long time.  My wife and daughter both commented that they liked it the first day I tried it.  It has an efficient mister type sprayer, so you don't get squirted, but get a controlled and consistent spray each time you press the sprayer.

"I replaced a traditional 5 speaker home theater system with this Bose SountTouch 130 and I could not be happier.  This is a GREAT.  The setup was incredibly simple, only took about 5 minutes.  The sound quality is excellent, and I mean excellent; movies, TV, action, horror, music, it all sounds great.The system is unobtrusive as well.  Unlike so many systems, it doesnt dominate your living room or tv stand/entertainment center.  This is very subtle, and very high quality.  It is almost unexpected when we watch a movie or game and the sound that is put forth is such high quality without the obvious speakers all over like most systems require.  To top it off, the sound quality is perfect at all volumes, you dont NEED to blast the sound to hear the bass, the sound is consistantly good throughout the entire volume range.Bose really came through with this system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9BRI5TLUJB1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6MPU#wasThisHelpful","R9BRI5TLUJB1L","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Once we got it assembled, this is a very nice 5-drawer chest.  Compared to what I can buy locally, it seems it may be a bit overpriced, especially since it is particle board with wood laminate over it.  For this price, I would expect solid wood.  I took 1 star off the review for the price.The second star came off of the review due to the assembly.  Let me start by saying I am a very handy guy, and my ability and tools available is the only reason this was able to be able to put together.  Some of the slots did not line up properly, specifically the cuts that the drawer bottom fits into, which required me to recut some areas in order to be able to assemble the drawers.  The holes for some of the attachment pins were blown out, requiring the area to be glued back together in order to stay assembled.  Finally, the holes on the back of the handles were far too small to accept the screws supposed to hold them in place, requiring significant force or drilling the holes larger to be able to install them.  It took FAR MORE THAN 90 MINUTES as stated in the instructions due to all the repairs required.Once assembled, this is a nice 5-drawer chest.  It is weighty enough to stay stable, drawers open and close smoothly, and it does not wobble.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BL5PKFK69R0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S8ZOJU#wasThisHelpful","R2BL5PKFK69R0W","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this would be a fun family game/competition, so I gave it a shot.  It is much larger than I expected, the cars and track are quite large.  The track is 10""-12"" across.  The track is basically just heavy construction paper.  The controls are touchy, but simple to use.  Driving the cars is a challenge.  While ON the track they cars drive well, much too fast to be controlled on the confines of the track, but they drive well.  The problem is that when they come OFF the track, they only turn left.  You can still steer them, but they go left like a Democrat, but only slightly veer to the right about 5 degrees.  That makes it nearly impossible to get them back on the track correctly, which turns the ""race"" into a competition of who can drive the slowest and manage to stay on the track, because as soon as it comes off the track you are going to lose the race.I image with a lot of practice someone can get good at racing these cars on the track, but my family and I got tired of this after one afternoon of racing each other.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OGKIB5TIEPNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGNT3KQ#wasThisHelpful","R1OGKIB5TIEPNG","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is exactly what I looks like it would be, a coffee cup for people who drink A LOT of coffee.  OK, maybe not, but it is great for transporting food to putlucks or picnics.  We have putlucks at my work every couple of weeks, I have used this to bring bbq sauce, shredded chicken for tacos, chili, and even chilled fruit.  It keeps everything hot, or cold, for hours.  If you rinse it with HOT water before filling it up, it will easily keep a hot food item hot from 6:00am to noon.  Chilled items will stay even longer, assuming you dont leave them in a hot car or somehting silly.The seal is excellent.  I have literally shook it up and down with liquid inside and it does not leak.  The four clamps and the seal make an amazing and secure seal.This is insulated similar to a YETI cup, so it should nto be used to cook with or put on a heat source.

"This is a great book to help you follow the diet plans recommended by Mark Lauren.  While Im no expert, it seems like the basics of it is to vary the types of food you eat, and the workouts you do, in order to keep your body from getting into too much of a routine.  Accoridng to Mark Lauren and others, the a routing allows your body to accomodate itself too much and you dont get the same overall benfit.The book is detailed, but easy to get through.  The recipes are great, very simple to follow and most seem tasty so far.  My only complain would be that since they are all a single serving size, the portions are werid.  Too many call for 3oz or 4oz of chicken breast, or similar odd portion sizes, so they you either have all kinds of random 1/3 chicken breast leftovers, or a lot of waste.  If you have a partner to share meals with, they recipes get easier to make as the sizes double, allowing you to use the entire chicken breast for a meal instead of only part of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36PU98V3Q3JEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553394959#wasThisHelpful","R36PU98V3Q3JEG","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

To start, it is HEAVY, no doubt it is well put together.  This is not a cheap watch that is all flash, it has substance to it.  The finish is excellent, everything mates together perfectly, no odd gaps or corners.This is a large watch, it may look akward on small framed people or anyone with skinny wrists.The chronograph feature is simple to use.  The time is easy to set and adjust.  The only part that is challenging is the band, as you have to remove links to make it fit (it comes very large, so I doubt anyone needs to add links).If you want something that looks nice to modestly fancy (does that make sense?), without spending a lot of money, this is a great watch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13P6G2VJ59ZS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCSRXAA#wasThisHelpful","R13P6G2VJ59ZS4","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No.  Does it work to keep a room cozy when its in the 30's or 40's outside?  Easily.We keep it in the living room so we can keep the living area comfortable without having to heat the entire house to that temperature.  Our bedrooms are a bit colder, but thats what blankets and cuddling are for.The wood grain finish is attractive.  The design of the unit allows it to be unobtrusive in a room, it doesnt scream ""HEATER OVER THERE"" when you walk into the room.

"I have boxed for years and been through too many sets of gloves to count.  These are a high quality set of bag gloves, but take some getting used to and breaking in.

I have LARGE hands and cant event fit in some types of gloves, I could fit in these but not if my hands are wrapped.  They start out tight enough to be uncomfortable after a few minutes, but after my first break in session they loosened up nicely.The velcro closure is secure, if not a bit hard to take off without help or using your teeth.

"I am a fan of Bose products, and these continue to support that.  The sound quality is excellent, outperforming several other high-end brands I own.  They are comfortable to wear, which is rare for most of the better sounding in-ear headphones.  Many companies rely on a crazy uncomfortable fit to ensure a seal around the ear in order to ensure their sound quality, this set sounds great AND is comfortable.I havent tried too many activities with these, but I have worn them at the gym and run on the treadmill with them and have not had any issues.  They stay in place, dont fill my ears with sweat, and sound great.  No more stopping to push my headphones back in place once I get sweaty, these stay where they are meant to.I believe their performance is due to Bose constantly finding ways to make every detail correct, instead of just focusing on bass, or noice cancelling, Bose does it all.I highly recommend these headphones for anyone in the market for a good set, whether you need 'sport' style or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RLX652U0X6QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RFPCC#wasThisHelpful","R2RLX652U0X6QR","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The cubic zirconia are barely noticable, but that's not really the part she likes anyway.  It is just a simple but attractive bracelet.  It is fairly lightweight and doesnt clank on the wrist like a contstant nuesance, but she says its heavy enough to tell you are wearing it.This is not nice enough to qualify as a special occasion gift unless you are in Junior High, but for a ""just because"" or ""thinking of you"", it's perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SWOS39C141BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBWHY76#wasThisHelpful","R2SWOS39C141BY","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is really a lot of fun.  It is much easier to use than some of the other remote helicopters/drones I have tried (all under $200).  The little plastic cage allows it to be run around the house on the floor like a car, or flown around the house without worry of breaking.  My 12 year old picked it up almost instantly and was harrassing the cat with it in no time.  He did have an epic crash which broke a propeller, but thankfully there are extras in the box.This is great fun, affordable, and easy to use.

It is built in a noticably more ""heavy duty"" fashion than others, the plastic is thicker, the cord is heavy duty, and overall less ""rattle"" to it.  The performance is excellent, it really cleans and does it quickly.  The ease of filling and emptying the resevours is excellent as well.As with all carpet cleaners, it is loud, louder than a vacuum cleaner.

"I will blame the cahange in the feel of the phone with the new case, but I dropped my phone as soon as I put the case on....  OOOPS!  Good news, THE CASE WORKS!  Not my preferred way of evaluating a new phone case, but it definately made an impact (haha).  So, now that I knw the case will protect a phone I will say that it is cool looking too.  It is not slippery to hold, which doesnt help explain me dropping it, but I havent dropped it other than that one time.  It adds some bulk, but not so much it is uncomfortable to hold or akward for me to put the phone in my pocket (any more akward than it normally is).

"This is a great set of kitchen shears.  They are one of the best Ive used, and they are a great price!  I like the narrow head on the blades, it allows you to easily access cramped angles, especially when working around chicken joints and similar items.  They are durable and powerful cutting, easily cutting through chicken bones when I dissassembled a chicken this weekend.They are sharp with a slightly serrated blade which seems to grab hold of what you are cutting to keep it from popping away from the cut, holding it firmly in place to cut exactly where you intended.  I plan on getting an extra set to keep in the garage, since I tried them out on a project this weekend and they worked just as well there.  I dont want to have to go back and forth looking for them, and they are afforedable, so Im getting another set.Great shears at a great price.

"We go through a lot of charging cables in my house so I get to try many different types.  This is a great one, it solves the main problem I believe is behind worn out cables.... the length.  Why do they all seem to be 3 feet long?  How often is 3' from an outlet conventient?  Do you organize your house so you keep a nightstand or table within 3' of the outlet you want to charge your phone?  That is why I like this cable, 4 feet seems to be a much more logical length.  I can plug my phone in AND still use it without having to stand hunched over (Im 6'2"" tall).  I can plug my phone in and not have it teetering on the edge of my nightstand because its thethered 3' to the outlet away.  The extra 25% in legth really makes a difference, Im no longer constantly tugging on my cable accidentally or stretching it to the full length, so the cable lasts longer.I also appreciate the flat cable, they seem to avoid twisting and cracking better then the round cables.  Admittedly a little harder to coil if you need to, but they dont tangle and break as easily.Overall this is a great cable at a good price.  If you need a new one, dont hesistate getting this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2046UUCL6J1KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW06GXA#wasThisHelpful","R2046UUCL6J1KX","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great case for the Kindle Voyage.  One of the great things about the Voyage is its size, so it is hard to find a case that provides more than visual appeal or one that is too bulky.  This case is perfect for us; it is waterproof and offers realistic protection, without having flaps, stands, and supports all over it making it excessively bulky.All of the buttons and items necessary for normal use easily accessable.  The waterproof feature is the great for my wife, as she always want to read while relaxing in a bath but is too nervous she will drop it and ruin her Kindle, problem solved!Great protection, easy use, and waterproof, all without ruining the size benefit of the Kindle Voyage.

"I original saw this and thought it was another crock pot or slow cooker, then I realized it really is a ""Multi Cooker"" as it is named.  What is the difference?  My previous slow cookers have all had 2, maybe 3 settings; High and Low, occasionally a setting in the middle.  While 'HIGH' is hot, it is not 450 degrees hot.  That is what makes this Mutli Cooker so nice, it will do everything a slow cooker can do and more.Say you want to cook a pot roast, you can brown it in the  Multi Cooker set on 450, then drop the temperature and add the other ingredients and have a tasty pot roast.  There is no need to brown in other pans and then transfer everything into your slow cooker.  The same goes for casseroles, you can cook them in the cooker at a real temerature like your over, but the the added benefit of not burning the top while the food underneath cooks!The controls are simple, cleanup is easy, it is heavy enough to be sturdy and not slide all over the counter but not so heavy that it is a hassle to move or store.This is great, I am incredibly glad I gave it a try.

"I have several GOAL ZERO items, and they have all performed better than expected.  This is another excellent GOAL ZERO product.  I already have the other power pack which operates on rechargable AA or AAA batteries.  This one does not use those types of batteries, but the trade off is that this one is able to charge more items before it needs recharged and it has a shut down option which prevents battery drain while not in use.This in not waterproof, it is best described as 'rain proof' in my opinion, as you can let it get damp or wet, but no submerged.  Im not sure how important this is to me, as Im not usually recharging electronics in the rain or while swimming, but it is nice not worry about it being ruined if my pack gets wet while I get caught in the rain.The Power Pack is slightly larger than the palm of my hand, and I have big hands.  It is not pocket sized unless you are wearing cargo pants.It charges quickly, retains charge for a very long time, and it quickly charges my phone and iPad at the same time.  It has 'smart' technology so it automatically determines the proper charge speed for devices so you dont have to select various options to match your device like some other chargers require.Overall, if you want a PowerPack which can recharge multiple items, multiple times, and possibly in an outdoor environment, this is your option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QB6ZMWFD6EJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY2HXFU#wasThisHelpful","R1QB6ZMWFD6EJ8","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I carry a pocket tool every day at work.  I currently carry the Leatherman Skeletool, it has its limitations, but good.  I have several SOG multi-tools (B66 & B61) and I LOVE them, LOVE them, but they are too big and bulky to carry in a pocket and I dont like using the holster type cases.  Based on my love for the other SOG tools, I was excited for this, and utterly disapointed when I tried it.I clipped it in my pocket for its first day as my new pocket multi-tool, by the time I got to work it felt funny.  I tried to take it out of my pocket, and discovered it open.  After I wedged it out of my pocket, I closed it back up and went about my day.  Every time I sat down, bent, or did anything, it opened, what a massive disapointment.  It didnt take long before my Skeletool was back in my pocket and this one was living in the door handle pocket of my truck.  Now, instead of opening in my pocket it opens every time I hit a bump.  Did they not test this before they sent it out?  Somebody had to know this was a problem, who wants a switchblade action set of pliers popping open every time you sit down?To add to the disapointemet, it seems odd that you have to completely open the tool in order to get the knife or other items out.  Most pocket type multi-tools now come with an easy access knife blade so you dont have to unfold the tool to get to the blade.  Regarding the tools, the ONE good point I found for this was that the tools and knife blade inside the handle are the same top quality that come in the other SOG tools, and appear to also be interchangeable with the tools you can buy from the SOG webpage.Aside from just leaving the plyers open all of the time, defeating the whole purpose of a pocket tool, this seems like a massive failure from SOG.  I am a fan of most SOG items; the SEAL Pop knife is one of the best knife deals you can get, I believe the normal multi-tools by SOG are the best in the market, and their hatchets and hawks are also great quality, but I cant recomend this item to anyone compared to the other tools available and the problems this one has.I gave it 2 stars because while I consider its use as a folding multi-tool to be a failure, the actual tools function flawlessly.  When open, the pliers are fantastic, grip well, and easily provide ample force.  The blade, file, screwdriver bits, and other items are all functional and well designed.  USING the tool is a joy, carrying it is a frustrating disapointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25403NE9JCRZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TT9X4L0#wasThisHelpful","R25403NE9JCRZZ","ANRXH0BVEAR6B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANRXH0BVEAR6B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a brilliant idea, so useful.  I have numerous pry bars I use for woodworking, metal working, and mechanical repairs.  All are great on one or two angles or pressures, but none are universal.  While this one is not all encompassing and render all others obsolete, it is incredibly useful.  From pulling nails, alignging boards, or getting into odd positions to apply presure to move a part, this thing can adjust to the job.The adjustment is easy, and locks into position automatically.  I doubt the indexing joint would pry open a bank door, but it is more than strong enough for anything I have tried so far.  No wiggle, locks up tightly.The overall size and weight is great, just right for most jobs where you dont need crazy leverage but you want more than you get with the claw of a hammer.

"Let me start with saying I am not an expert knife thrower.  I have knowledge and skill with knives, but typically I do not throw them.  That beign said, these are 3 decent knives.  After watching a few YouTube videos, I can stick them in my backyard fence faily well.  They seem to throw nicely and have a good comfortable balance.As knives, not necessarily throwing knives, but just knives, they are decent.  The heat treat is good enough that they are not brittle, yet hold an edge fairly well.  I would not compare them with $200 knives, but they easily beat most of the cheapo imports sold as ""survival knife"".I agree with the other reviewers that the sheath/holder is poor.  It is not practical to carry the knives, draw them from, and especially replace them into the nylon holder.  I would suggest it is for storage only, not suitable for use of any sort.The shape is comfortable for use as a regular knife, even without the handle.

"This is an excellent set of electronic hearing protection.  I have used this type of hearing protector since the late 1990's when I won a set at a match.  Some sets are capable of directional sound, while others amplify sound evenly across both sides equally, losing all ability to tell direction.  This set still allows you to hear the direction of sound, even amplifying surrounding sounds, while cutting out the sounds at unsafe levels.  When it cuts the sound out, it only cuts the sounds which should be, which allows you to hold a conversation while someone is shooting at the lane next to you at the range.These are as comfortable as I have used, the padding is soft and does not absorb sweat.  They are also lightweight, so you dont get a headache wearing them for long periods.

Her gladness spreads, first to her little brother, then her teenage sister, then her friends and family.A neat story with character-building lessons.

"First, very important for a children's book is correct grammar and punctuation. The title should be: THE DOG WHO SAVED NOAH'S ARK. The  basic facts should be correct. Noah was told to build an ark for animals AND any people who would enter in. Also, the Bible tells us that Adam named the animals -- so I have to assume that they remained named even to Noah's time.But I guess a storyteller has permission to remold a story to suit his theme. Although we begin with the unicorn, the theme become how the dog helped Noah and continues to help people today. Dogs especially cheer up people with their wet noses -- in this way passing on God's love. The illustrations, a mixture of paintings and photos, add color to the story but not unity.

The font was either too small or, when I tapped it, too large for all the sentences to fit on the screen. Maybe others won't have this problem on their e-readers. Best of all were how colorful and lively the illustrations came through.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R1F6FEFTXPN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014E5XA12#wasThisHelpful","R2R1F6FEFTXPN4","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Blessed are the bonds that bind bereaved family members together! This author binds me to her heart as she relates the loss of her mother at a young age. My wife and I just lost our daughter -- this book touches those tender points that youthful death brings to us, whoever we lost. It's true, as the author says, ""the loneliness never stops. You hold on to what once was, and will never be again."" We the bereaved hold on to what remains--memories, mementos, photos, letters, other loved ones. What remains most of all? That soft place within us that is at the same time fully empty and fully filled.This book just tugs at those empty-filled places with its tender memories and expressions of enduring bonds. ""True love is not without pain,"" she says. The poetic sentences come so naturally from the author's deepest self: ""Raindrops, like teardrops, are known to fall at will, and pay no attention to desires for a sunny outcome."" (page 65).This book is a love story between a young child and her mother that continues even after the mother's death. It's about broken hearts, dreams and loneliness through which comes healing. There is a MASTER PLAN, if we will accept it. I personally want to thank Ms. Brougher, the author, for sharing her grief and recovery with me so I too can follow that journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262MNZ3AY4DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ1BY0G#wasThisHelpful","R262MNZ3AY4DF","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"YOU ARE THERE! The authors rich writing style reminds me of that  TV program with Walter Cronkite. Its through the authors appeal to my senses and imagination that Im transported into the world of Palmyra in the 3rd century, and into the castle and life of Zenobia, her sisters, mother and father. Even the rhythm of the writing has that feel of ancient Arabia and grips me with its near-poetry.EXAMPLE: This is the season when the winds come from the eastfrom Eran and from Indian and beyond, slow and languid and heavy with the odor of spice. What verbal art! And there is much more of it in this book.BUT -- there is also much conflict among family members and tribes of that time. The greatest conflict, though, is within 17-year-old ZENOBIA, a beautiful woman who desires much more than an ordinary marriage, or a safe and luxurious home, and even more than the rich and exuberant trading capital of Palmyra can give her. Can a woman of her time and place achieve greatness, even become a ruler?  Can she experience love that is of her own choosing and not dictated by her family and traditions?AH!WE HAVE GRIPPING AMBITION AND FAITHFUL ROMANCE. We have stories of the lowly rising to glory, and of the glorious falling to ignominy. We have Zenobia and her lover battling the Roman powers. We have heartbreak and loss. And most of all, we have gods that the heroes believe guide their destinies. And yet, the heroes also fight the whims of those gods with will and strength.About one-third of the way into this book, I began to ask how true to history was this bookso I read some articles on her. SHE WAS NOT FICTION! I was so pleased that she actually lived in Palmyra in the third century, that she rebelled against the government and fought to achieve her destiny. And suffered for it. I was intrigued by the Authors Note on how she created this book by seeking to remain faithful to the historical record and to the feel of the characters. As a writer I learned much. As a reader, I was fully drawn into this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMZPWW4V7J0Z1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VOLHKHU#wasThisHelpful","RMZPWW4V7J0Z1","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From childhood, I have loved dogs and had a number of ""big dogs."" But if I ever decide to have a small dog, I'd highly consider a Bichon Frise. The adorable pictures and the brief but insightful descriptions have convinced me that a Bichon would be ideal in many ways. They are ""so sociable and they enjoy being taken on outings and meeting new people"" (loc. 49).The author lightens her descriptions with a few puns and humorous description. She refers to the Bichon frise as ""An Old Sea Dog."" Why? Most interesting. Also, she shows that some famous painters used this dog in their works. These dogs are also little actors, easy to teach tricks to and get to perform. Yet, for their many centuries of being the household dog of choice overseas (including royal castles and ships), this dog wasn't bred in the USA until 1956. The American Kennel Club recognized it as a breed in 1973.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L3878R8QPHWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DAB4JW#wasThisHelpful","R3L3878R8QPHWY","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This booklet can serve as a good overview but I recommend more reliable resources to learn the facts about diabetes and dogs. Unfortunately, no resources are listed or quoted in this booklet.Medical people hardly ever refer to ""sugar diabetes;"" rather, it's diabetes mellitus. As I read this short booklet, I got the impression that the author was gathering facts from just a few sources. Thus there was some repetition and wordiness. Skilled editing could've made the material flow better and be better organized.. For example, such phrases as: ""It is a well known fact that..."" is a lazy researcher's way of trying to be credible.The author loses my credibility with some statements that my further research proved wrong. The author states: ""Scientific studies have shown that diabetes in dogs is only Type 1 or insulin dependent...."" But a reputable veterinarian site states: ""Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in dogs. It is due to the bodys impossibility of metabolizing sugar which remains in the blood and harms other internal organs.""I strongly recommended that readers use this booklet as a jumping-off point to research further; the internet is very helpful in this.

"This short book is well-structured and to the point, strengthened with apt Scriptures. First, the author asks us to examine the words coming out of our mouths, for ""the tongue can bring death or life"" (Proverbs 18:21.) That means that ""what you say today can change the course of your life forever."" That thought really hit home with me as a writer, speaker and a Christian. Just think: What we speak can produce -- life... hope... peace... blessing... healing... restoration. Or their opposites -- death... discouragement.. war... curses... pain... destruction.How do we ""speak"" good outcomes? The author gives us pointed and practical guidelines. Guard your mouth -- guard your heart (mind) -- think before you speak -- meditate on God's word before you think! That's workable and powerful advice for me -- and perhaps you will think it's good for you. So I recommend this book.

"In many ways this is a book that the reader (parent, older siblings, etc.) can really make alive for youngsters. For preschoolers and early graders, some of the words and sentences are too complicated. But don't let that stand in the way of TELLING and SHOWING these stories to youngsters. Just interact with them because the stories and illustrations are very imaginative and character-building.For instance, take the story LETTER IN A BOTTLE. Ask the listeners questions such as: ""Foxy brushed the crumbs under the carpet. Was that a good idea? What would you have done if you were Foxy?"" ""How would you help Foxy understand neatness?"" I imagine Foxy is much like a four-or-five-year-old boy or girl. They can't write essays! So apply the story to the maturity of the listeners.The next story, OLIVER MEETING JUMPY, is joyful AND dramatic--love it! Again, it can lend itself to imaginative chit-chat between reader and listener. Ask: ""How are friends made? How did you meet your friends?""ENCHANTED FOREST is quite an adventurous and imaginative story too. It also can lend itself to interaction between you as reader and the children as listeners. What are ""meerkats?"" they'll want to know. How come Oliver happened to have his magic wand with him? Was it fair of him to treat the witch as he did? Some good character lessons here.

"This book begins with a general overview of meditation and then gets into effective but uncomplicated techniques. Is it worth learning to meditate well and to do it consistently? After reading this book and practicing just a few of the techniques for a few weeks, I believe so. The last few months I've personally faced some very stressful events and need to connect more with my inner peace.The author points out that for many people the greatest risk is misunderstanding what day-to-day meditation is all about. Often this wrong concept is of some person withdrawing from life and sitting in a lotus position for hours on end. But regular and effective meditation happens in the moments here and there, as well as the 10 or 15 minutes we set aside to quiet our minds.

"This author has done an excellent work in demonstrating that introverts have as much, or more, power than extroverts. He tells the stories of 12 world leaders spanning 2600 years and a diverse mix of countries and religions. Another neat technique he uses is disguising the names of his subjects until the end. This keeps you guessing, or if you've guessed early, then you want to see if you're right.I'd be giving away some of the suspense if I told you the names of these renowned individuals. Several are great military leaders; some statesmen and revolutionaries; some are religious figures who eventually attracted millions to their way of spirituality. And one is a college student who saw a need to meet the needs of foreign college students and acted on it.So, yes, he shows that introverts can be great leaders and reformers. As we see this demonstrated in their lives, we also learn principles by which we can do greater things for others. Introverts have imaginations and visions. They begin with small steps that grow into giant leaps, sometimes in their own lifetime, often over the centuries. So if you're shy, reserved, an introvert, you have much within you that can impact the world around you--and beyond--with a better life.This book is written quite well, considering that the author's native language is not English.

"Without it being obvious, this book conveys a lesson so important for children of all ages, as well as older folks. It's done through the actions of a cute cat who thinks herself as most beautiful. She wanders about her neighborhood looking for a friend to play with. She doesn't want just any friend but one who is also as beautiful as she thinks she is. The author's rhythmic lines fit each encounter Kitty has with other animals, and their reactions to her snotty attitude. The illustrator does a masterful job in matching those lines. So we have a wonderful combination of words and colors to make this story roll along.In the second half of this book we see how Kitty pays for her snobby manner. Kids will see this lesson clearly for themselves. I wish, though, that the author had shown the action that Kitty could've taken to redeem herself. Perhaps that would've been by losing that fancy ribbon, roughing up her groomed fur, and mixing in with all the others. Still, the author had a particular goal in mind and she accomplished it very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VFYVA1PNMFZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZSGIDI#wasThisHelpful","R2VFYVA1PNMFZS","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This author, Anat Umansky so well-versed and revered for her books in Hebrew, now brings us a story by Baal Shem Tov, the Rabbi who founded Jewish Hasidism.

"EDGAR DEGAS (1834 to 1917) was a famous French artist  paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings. More than half of his works features dancing and dancers. Critics labeled him as Impressionist but he preferred Realist.Degas was obsessed with painting early in his life. In his high school and college years, he had turned a room in his house into a studio. His art teacher gave him this advice: Draw lines, young man, and still more lines, both from life and from memory, and you will become a good artist. Do you think thats good advice? Why or why not?Look at his self-portrait #1. What can you tell about him? What did Degas want others to see? Painting #3 we have a dance class. How does it resemble todays dance studios? Whats different? Besides dancing, what other subjects did Degas love to paint? Look closely at paintings in a category, such as portraits of people and people in common pursuits. How well do you think Degas captured the soul of these people?To observe paintings and think about the whys and hows of the artist makes them more meaningful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZM8V1BH1LCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9Z0RMW#wasThisHelpful","R1NZM8V1BH1LCO","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rembrandt (July 1606  Odtober 1669)How would you like a name like Harmenszoon Van Rijn Rembrandt? No wonder he is almost always referred to as plain REMBRANDT! But in the Netherlands long names were common. He grew up in a large household, being the ninth child in a well-to-do family. I wonder how that would influence his art? Thats a subject that children can considerhow does ones family encourage or discourage art?Religion was another fervent influence in the family. His mother was a Roman Catholic and his father of Dutch Reformed faith. Thus Rembrandts works reveals his deep Christian faith. Rembrandt painted many portraits of people in his land, including self-portraits. He portrayed his subjects realistically, no vanity or disguising faults.Depending on your young observers, you might have them react to the first painting, a self-portrait. Would you like this fellow for a father or grandfather? Do you think hes a pleasant man? Spend a minute or so on all the portraits in this collection and see the similarities or differences.How does Painting #4 strike you, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee? Is it a frightening scene? Who is in the boat? What other paintings have their inspiration in the Bible stories? Then we have the mythology paintings  such as The Abduction of Europa."" Does this look real to you? Why or why not? Since this artist painted much of common life of the time, what can you learn about that time and people?As usual in this series of books, you have to consult other sources for information about the artist and his paintings.

"JACKSON POLLOCK (1912-1956) was an influential American painter with his ABSTRACT IMPRESSIONIST style. Heres an intriguing question for young and old: What is drip painting? Thats what Pollock used.Children relate to the childhood of famous people, such as these artists. For instance, young Jackson was expelled at age 16 from several high schools. Then at age 18 he and his older brother Charles moved to New York City and studied at the Art Students League. So you see a determined but independent young fellow here. Do young people need to be rebellious in order to be artists? Theres a question for your young students to consider.ABSTRACT ARThow can young art students learn to understand it? Let them view each painting until they get some meaning or feeling to express. Take Autumn Rhythm, for instance. Are autumn and rhythm expressed here? How? How do the colors make you feel in Convergence? Spend enough time with all 24 paintings in this book and talk about colors, patterns, moods, any discernible subject matter such as in Blue. How do the artists titles for each painting express the feeling or meaning?Wouldnt it be quite an experience FOR the youngsters, and even us teachers, to try some of this DRIP PAINTING?

"PAUL CEZANNE (1839-1906) was a French POST-IMPRESSIONIST painter. His work led to the transition from 19th century style into a radically different 20th century art world. He set the stage for the CUBISM of Matisse and Picasso; both credit him as the father of us all.Since these art collections are chosen for kids, it would be inspiring if we got a hint of famous artists as children. For instance, at age 10 Paul entered College Bourbon and made friends with Emile Zola and Baptistin Bailleall three were friends for life ever after. Ask kids: Do you have friends for life? In 1857 Paul began at the Free Municipal School of Drawing in Aix. His father was not in favor of this as he wanted his son to be a lawyer. So Paul attended law school but continued drawing.I think it would help childrens imagination to think about Cezannes paintings as they do not reflect visual reality as much as feeling realityimpressionism. A good exercise for all is to look closely at objects, people or other sights and freely connect to the inner being of those. This is what artists try to do. For instance, Still Life with a Curtain shows what appears to be scattering of cloths, pitcher and fruit. Why did the artist not arrange these objects more harmoniously? Then nature scenes such as Jas de Bouffan and Mont Sainte-Victoire seem soft on details but convey a sense of peace. Or do they? Something for art lovers to consider.The portraits of people are bodily disproportionate, such as The Card Player and Madame Cezanne in a red dress."" They have rather long bodies compared to their heads. Others like these also seem unrealistic or unflattering. Id talk with children about what was the artists purpose in this? How does it make you feel to see people like this? Compare and contrast paintings in groupsnature, people, still life. That should draw out some creative thoughts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTST805V48MVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI4Y2NQ#wasThisHelpful","RTST805V48MVF","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a painter most appealing to children because of her subject matter  emphasis on the life between mothers and children. She has been classed among the impressionists but her style is very accessible to us because it is also realistic.For instance, The Boating Party captures a mother in a boat being oared by the father. The mother holds her baby. The colors and details are subdued. I suggest letting children look at this painting quietly for a minute or two, and then give their impressions.A number of the selected paintings are of women, some beautiful, some ordinary, in everyday settings. For these Id let children gaze on a painting and then give their impressions  remember, these are impressionistic paintings. Then, after they respond to separate works, have them react to all of them as one. Then they could do the same with the paintings of children  at the beach, girl with a straw hat, little girl with her nanny, girl with pink sash, breakfast in bed, Sara holding a cat.The best learning experience would be for the children to be the painter, Mary Cassatt and draw, water color or paint in her style for a bit. Encourage them to get their impressions into their works, not so much what they see but what they feel.These series of books are mere collections of these various artists. In many cases children will benefit from talking about them with knowledgeable teachers and readers. You can, of course, get vast information on all of these artists on the internet or other books. I recommend that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VSTX7DTCT4GD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP45F62#wasThisHelpful","R3VSTX7DTCT4GD","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I see those self-portraits of Henry Rousseau, I think it would inspire some youngsters to do the same for themselves. Theyll see impressionism  and they can be instructed to paint impressions rather than try to draw and paint exactly what they see. Thats a great step forward for young artists  older ones too. .This book, like others in the series, is best gazed upon and talked about with those who know a bit about the artist and his/her style. Thats why I wish the compiler of these books wouldve told us a bit more about the artists, their childhood, how they got into art, and how they painted. Thus, these books could be more entertaining and inspirational.Take that Boy on the Rocks. Why is this painting more artistic than what a 10-year-old would paint? A question like that would free up a kids imagination and perhaps make him less critical of himself as an artist. The Sleepy Gypsy could be used for a story  why, where, who, when, what. See details even in what looks like a simple painting. The Mill is also good for that, and for showing simplicity of lines and colors. The Football Players may make the kids laugh  and see.Rousseau said he had no teacher other than nature. Theres a fact from his life that would free us to see how that iinfluenced his art, and how we can learn without formal teachers. We as teachers of young children can make these little collections WORK with a little help from the internet or other books that tell us more about the artists and their lives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16OMHH3TFXX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KP0TV3C#wasThisHelpful","R16OMHH3TFXX2","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For understanding the basic principles of Buddhism in a short time, this book fits the bill. But it is too short for any kind of in-depth experience. We have a brief history of the growth of Buddhism in the 11th Century CE (AD) in Tibet, a country where Buddhist became very central and remains such today.""The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances,"" and ""the greatest meditation is a mind that lets go."" (Loc. 73). To get there, you need to understand the ""Four Noble Truths,"" the distilled essence of Buddhism. This book clearly outlines these. It also deals with handling suffering, reducing attachment, and following THE EIGHT-FOLD PATH.This book helped me better understand the teachings and power of Buddhism. I'm challenged to follow the eight paths -- RIGHT view ... intention ...  speech ... action .. livelihood ... effort .. mindfulness ... concentration. Then it gives me a brief introduction to the central activity to do this: MEDITATION PRACTICE. Although a brief introduction to Buddhism, I found it clear and motivational.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDR3O5M9TJBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057H0HTU#wasThisHelpful","RDR3O5M9TJBW","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

How did he avoid becoming bitter? How did he depend on God to see him through? It does take faith to trust God, Steve said, even when you cant explain your struggles.God does hear you. But what do you do when it seems as if God doesnt hear? St. Pauls experience helps in our hearing Gods will in our lives. Why suffering  where did it come from? We can be assured of this, as this booklet points out: Jesus Christ is the way through our suffering.

"The author gives us a brief history of an early church reformer, John Hus of Bohemia. But this book is not only about him -- it is about Christians at the end of the 1300s and early 1400s, trying to cope with a tumultuous world, made more so by the Catholic papacy. Or, more correctly, ""papacies"": at times there were more than one, up to three at one time.John Hus was such a young man when he completed his university studies and became involved in University life, first as a student and then as a professor. He was born in 1373 -- became a priest in 1400, and Rector of the Prag University in 1402. A powerful preacher, a follower of Wiclif (Wycliffe), and a staunch teacher and writer of the true Gospel.Pope John XXIII condemned Hus as a heretic and had him imprisoned. In spite of dozens of pleas made to him, Hus would not recant. He said: ""I stand before the judgment of God; He will judge me and you in righteousness, as we deserve it."" (Loc. 275). This is just one of a few dozens quotes this book gives us. I found all personally inspiring. These chosen quotes make this book worthy in my collection.I found some lack of clarity in a few sentences, not knowing whom the author was referring to. After all, there were many ""actors"" and it's tricky to keep them straight. But as a whole this short book is a good read for history of Hus' time and for inspiration in the Christian faith.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27WNBHNA6AGZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083ZUEBY#wasThisHelpful","R27WNBHNA6AGZN","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The quote by Nobel prize winner  in physics, Eugene Wigner, explains the world that the author invents. The very study of the external world led to the conclusion that the content of the consciousness is an ultimate reality. Other quotes upfront hint at the authors purpose. She takes on the challenges offered: to make real through her characters the nature of the human self, and perhaps understand ""the flow of time, or incontrovertible evidence that it is indeed an illusion.In short, although this novel at times is entertaining, it is not meant for easy reading. It is not a genre novel, neither a sci-fi or a murder mystery. THERE IS MORE METAPHYSICS THAN SCIENCE -- more a muddle than a murder mystery. Sci-fi needs science as its basis but the invented world here is DYSTOPIC UTOPIAN. A murder mystery needs characters you can love and hate and events that in the end tie the plot all together. That doesn't happen.At first my senses of imagination and beauty were pleased. People passed over the hidden river, each on his or her way, while down there, the river roared and raged in the darkness. But about one-quarter of the way into the novel, my senses got tired out and bogged down. The beauty did not continue.Yet, I was intrigued by the duality of the main character, Rhein, who recognizes he has another personality. Rhein struggles to maintain his sanity and reclusiveness. He knows he is also ""The Artist"" but cant quite seem to connect with him or his art. In fact, the main motif throughout the book is Rhein and his ""friends"" struggle to get a glimpse of the Artist's 31 paintings that are covered up. This is somewhat like Godot who never shows up in Samuel Becketts WAITING FOR GODOT.In fact, I found nihilism to be the dominant underpinning for the plot, setting and all characters. The only meaning in life is to retreat from it, to find meaning by assuming some meaning, and to try to solve problems without solutions.Some reviewers give the author too much credit by holding that she explores quantum physics through her novels. This theory also lets the readers invent alternate storylines. Thats why some reviewers like the book and many dontthey had to interpret what was really happening in a world where nothing was real. Or where the only reality was in Rheins unbalanced mind, or perhaps his doubly-balanced mind. The long segment about his entering the cave and tunnel along with other characters paints a stark picture of this duality. At times Rhein finds pleasure in the exploration, at times he hates it and it threatens his life. At times he has to crawl through narrow passages on his hands and knees, and at other times he can stand up straight. Then there are the murders -- but are there? The characters reappear even though they were killed.I give much credit to the author for her skill in handling very tricky transitions and episodes. Chapter 65 switches to present tense as Rhein faces a final challenge. But it is perhaps reincarnation time! The epilogue hints at that: We travel endlessly down our winding paths through time, and they are always before us: our possible versions. I enjoyed the poetic sentiments here, and that last sentence was a WOW. Id suggest you read this epilogue first as it really anchors the story, as much as nihilism combined with quantum metaphysics can do.My review rating on this book may not be yours. Remember, the storyline for you can be different than for me and others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBCDCA2YGH23V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXX5B62#wasThisHelpful","RBCDCA2YGH23V","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Through the poet's eyes and the artist's brushes, you can feel the sights and sounds of the ocean. A very good blend between the two. It's a relief to read the occasional poetry book that has pure descriptive verse rather than some obtuse meanings. Yet, you can spend meditative time with some of these verses and paintings, just relaxing, reflecting, enjoying the simplicity of the words, the pastel portrayal of ""the dreams of the turtle king,"" pelicans, sea gulls, and even those connected to the footprints in the sand.A few word images are striking, or confusing. ""A man, staggering,/ pushes a shopping cart/ with a woman upside-down,/ laughing, inside."" I can't quite picture that BELIEVABLY! How can a woman be ""upside-down"" in a shopping cart? Well, just trying to imagine that got be a laugh and a moment of joy.In free verse, sometimes we wonder WHY the poets break lines where they do. Of course, between phrases is understandable. But there has to be more reason than just ""it's time to."" For instance, we have these two lines: ""The seashells cover the/ beach this morning."" Why break between ""the"" and ""beach""?Overall, I had a relaxing and enjoyable time with this book of quiet poems and meditative artwork. Both poet and illustration did a very good job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXW66IX7WXUCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5CZNCQ#wasThisHelpful","RXW66IX7WXUCE","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am inspired by the author's story of how this story came to be, and how he developed into a faith-based writer. That helped me to FEEL as if he is personally telling me this story. My father was a farmer too, so I can closely relate. But I think giving the year of the story as well as the month would've helped pinpoint the setting better. Also, a little less of the involved descriptive phrases would've made it flow better: ""The sun gouged the unclouded sky like the tip of a colossal white sword, wielded by the master of Hades himself..."" And how old was ""I,"" the boy storyteller? Need such details upfront.Yet, even though the adjectival phrases are too much at the beginning, I can FEEL the heat and drought and hard work. I can sense the drama in the field as the pair plowed. Then -- the pain of the father's strength disappearing and the son watching. Soon the son has to take over more and assume more responsibilities. Here's a lesson of dedication and courage for all.Then the lesson of a gift of a pocket watch -- so touching and tender.

(2) Knowing how to communicate and present yourself to friends, classmates, business leaders, etc., is the BIGGEST SKILL anyone, youth or adult, can develop. (3) Social and communication skills have become sadly-lacking for the present and the previous generation, ever since the rise of electronic media and ever-present entertainment.THE SOCIAL SKILLS -- from simple but powerful actions such as smiling, asking questions, displays of gratitude, self-confidence and gaining knowledge.THE BUSINESS SKILLS  from hunting for a job, preparing for an interview, to the interview and follow-up.ENTREPRENEUR SKILLS  starting your own business, volunteering, applying to college, selling skills, customer and client service, standing out from the crowd, becoming a leader.The book says for teens. Well, Im about 55 years past that group  but I benefited greatly and know younger and older folks than I am will too.

And he's rather arbitrary -- deciding which actions were active good deeds and which were passive, achieved by NOT doing bad deeds.

The book gives brief reasons -- largest bookseller in the world, compatible with many different e-readers, and quick turnaround, both for publishing (12-24 hours) and delivery (immediate). Payment of your royalties, though, could take a month or so. And generally, the more high-rating reviews you have, the more attention you attract. So how do you do that?SEVERAL METHODS. All require some consistent work and long hours. You need to become knowledgeable about Amazon's Reviewers' site -- over 30,000,000 ""reviewers"" listed and ranked--the highest number have the least reviews and ""likes,"" the lowest numbers have the most reviews and ""likes."" Actually most of the the reviewers, I'm concluding, in the 100,000+ ranking are not serious and submit few reviewers. So how do you zero in on getting reviews from the serious reviewers, those in the 10,000 and below ranking?The author gives clear and simple instructions how to contact reviewers. But there is a second method which might work better for a publisher--narrowing your niche by key words. The author also gives you two different templates to use -- that's neat. I recommend this book as a good guide in starting your own review process. All the techniques will work but be patient -- and offer the best book you can produce in your category! No shortcuts there. I also recommend you review many other authors' books that you read, and send a comment too. That usually gets into the author's email.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8KZFYON7VKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HMFDFS#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8KZFYON7VKZ","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just had to read a book written ""By Get-Hair-In-Poland!"" I suspect there will be some promotional material in this short book. Let's see.First, the author tells us why hair falls out. Somewhere between 50 and 100 hairs are replaced every day by new hair. But losing the follicles is a different matter--those are not replaced. The causes: genetics, hormones, disease or deficiency, drugs or medicines, burns or X-rays, shock or stress, autoimmune diseases, aging, over-styling. Well, that's good to know. But what can we control and/or reverse?DIET -- what to eat to reduce loss of hair follicles. Good standard nutritional advice here.EXERCISE -- for the entire body, including your hair follicles. Scalp massage might help also. Acupressure is worth doing too--not directly on your hair but on your fingernails! Yoga and meditation.HAIR CARE TECHNIQUES -- use of apple cider vinegar, olive oil, baking soda, eggs. Ways these could help.PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS -- with the advice of a health practitioner. Minoxidil and Finasteride -- pros and cons. Corticosteroid ointments and injections -- worth considering. Psoralen with ultraviolet A-Light therapy -- generally poor results.HAIR TRANSPLANTS -- several different kinds. CELL THERAPY -- one of the newest methods with a lot of promsie.Ah ha! Just a short plug for a clinic in Poland for hair transplantation! Arrive day one -- go home day two with a complete head of hair. But please -- go home with at least one or two weeks of experiencing Polish culture, history, architecture, people -- and FOOD! It'll be worth it. A quick read of this book was well worth my time too. I like it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGNAQ2PS4X2N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145FHNNC#wasThisHelpful","RGNAQ2PS4X2N6","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I did find some good principles of negotiating -- and being negotiated with -- in this short book. His counsel about listening more than talking and releasing the prospect's pressure are excellent. Give your prospect ""the right to veto"" is on target. About six or seven really strong principles that will help you, as they did me. I've been a writer in several fields over the last 40 years, including copy writing and promotion for an international firm. But I still find some useful advice.But here's the problem. An experienced writer in any field would not make so many common grammatical errors -- he would at least get an editor to correct his copy. The writer wouldn't try so hard yp use what he considers everyday communication, and sometimes winds up just being ""cute."" ""You know of what I speaketh, right?"" Uses the ""eth"" form too many times. Or ""methinks"" and ""stoopid sales tricks"" type of cuteness.So this book is an anomaly to me. That is, I can't imagine that the author, the renowned copy writer Ben Settle, wrote and edited it. I've checked into his web site which is much better written. But here's the kicker. This is a short book of 499 ""locations"" or about 39 pages. About 135 ""locations"" or 28% of the book is ""Disclosures and Disclaimers"" -- plus the copyright pages. Much of this is a total waste of words and space. A to-the-point copy writer wouldn't allow such a waste.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YMXTESVFJWDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J6GWM2#wasThisHelpful","R1YMXTESVFJWDE","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We remember Oscar Schindler mainly because of the movie ""Schindler's List."" We know of the Frank family of Holland because of the the diary of Anne Frank. But there are other heroes who rescued Jews and others from the Holocaust. This book helps us to realize that by setting these ""saviors"" in the history of their times before, during and sometimes after the Nazi domination.Raoul Wallenberg, for instance, of Sweden, saved 10,000s of Jews from the Holocaust. Born in 1912, he risked his young life for others, and disappeared in 1945, likely because of the Russian invaders. Many of the ""saviors"" were Christian. But some were of other faiths, such as the Muslims Hamid and Xhemai Veseli of Albania. Why did they do this? They said, ""Because of friendship and the holy Koran."" Another Muslim couple said of their risky efforts: ""To save one life is to enter paradise.""The author tells of these ""saviors"" also in Hungary, Italy, France, and other countries.  Some left their safe homes in USA to become ""saviors"" of people destined for the Holocaust. I was struck by the amazing story of Varian Mackey Fry, born in New York City in 1907. Sometimes struggling with bi-polar disorder, he still managed to save 1,500 Jews from death and persecution. Many of those were artists and intellectuals who went on to contribute greatly to humanity.This book certainly can't tell of all the heroes involved in saving Jews. But it tells enough in a moving way to inspire us to care for our oppressed fellow human beings in whatever situation they are. Because of that, I recommend it highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JUSGAYUYYPMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3NPNK0#wasThisHelpful","R1JUSGAYUYYPMP","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These summary type of books, highlighting the main points from the original bestseller, have their place  if theyre done well and remain true to the original. Executive Summary books by BookSwift meet that criteria. They are designed to shorten our reading time, hopefully lengthen our thinking time, so we can, as the introduction promises, walk away with the key core concepts.In this book there are over 90 chapters  that means an average of two chapters per page. And what intriguing chapter titles! About half  are about handling Resistance. Many are how a Professional handles the challenges of a creative life. Then a good number targets the power of forces we can use  The Higher Realm, Invoking the Muse, The Authentic Self, and more. Most inspiring.Even this summary refers to some examples the original author uses to make his points  and that is practical, inspiring and ALIVE. However, as I compare this summary to the full book (only 165 pages) I can see that the summary doesnt flesh out the lessons well enough. But it is an excellent way to prepare yourself for Stevem Pressfields masterpiece of self-motivation and development.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQN43FNDGSQ0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012F2QCKC#wasThisHelpful","RQN43FNDGSQ0T","AGTP9IA9HI0LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGTP9IA9HI0LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here's another one of those gift ideas for the BBQ or smoker chef. No more hovering at the grill, watching the temperature, while the rest of the party goes on without you.In the box you get the transmitter, the receiver, the sensor probe, and, believe it or not, the AAA batteries. The instructions are well written and explains all of the functions.Use is intuitive and straightforward. First I stuck the probe into the meat and transmitter. On the receiver, you then select the mode (temp or timer). In temp mode you then select the meat type. The choices are PROGram, GroundBEEF, GroundPOULtry, BEEF, VEAL, CHiCKEn, PORK, Poultry, LAMB, and FISH. (Capital letters are what shows in the display for each meat type. I just added the rest of the letters so it is easier to decipher.) Then you choose a ""taste"" level of RARE, MED RARE, MEDIUM, MED WELL, WELL DONE. I used it on a tri-tip first so I chose MED RARE. The background of the display turns blue once the meat has gone up 10 degrees. I just let it cook away, then once the meat reached 15 degrees away from the perfect temp, the display turns green! Cooking continued, then when it reached MED RARE, the display turned red and an alert beep goes off. Just press stop and the alarm is silenced. I was able to carry the receiver around the house and yard without ever losing signal (maybe 75'). I could go in and out of the house, which is nice since it is already below freezing while I'm grilling. Just clipped it to my belt like a cell phone and off I go. The tri-tip was cooked just right.Maybe you don't want to use the preset temps for your ""taste"". Then you can easily raise or lower the temp to your liking. For example, MED is set to 150 degrees. I learned to pull meats off of the grill 10 degrees before it hits the ""perfect"" temp and let it rest, covered. The meat will continue to cook for the rest of the 10 degrees and it won't be overdone. So just set the taste for MED, then press the MIN down arrow button till you reach 140. The display will show that you are now programming. Now you have it set to YOUR preferences, not the USDA guidelines. If you want to change it back to the presets, just press MEAT again and it will reset. Easy.You can also use the timer as well, just in case you have two items cooking. Maybe you want to remember to stir the beans every 5 minutes. You simply set the timer for 5 minutes and it beeps when the time is up. You can set it up to 24 hours, so I think that would cover just about any cooking times!This may look like it belongs on the construction site, but I wouldn't treat it as such. It is not waterproof, so grilling in the rain is out. The plastic is better than I've seen on other thermometers, but dropping it might not be best. The rubber armor surrounding the case should provide enough protection for most incidents.The probe itself, although stainless steel, cannot be immersed, so no dishwasher for this part. You can only wipe it down since you can't throw it in the sink, either. Not a deal breaker for me.I received one of these thermometers in exchange for an honest opinion, and I honestly love this one. I would give this as a gift to any of my grilling friends. I, just like you, rely on reviews in order to make smarter purchases, so I tried not to leave out any details. If I change my mind later, I will change my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5A2Y39M5GXAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DAVCP4#wasThisHelpful","R5A2Y39M5GXAG","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really looking forward to trying this one. Tronfy sent me one of these Mini Bluetooth Headsets in exchange for an honest review. I wish I could say I liked it more, but I could never get it to fit right. I tried every combination of hooks and ear ""covers"" but the ear bud kept falling out.On the good side, it paired really easy with my Kyocera Hydro XTRM. No issues whatsoever. It was charged in less than an hour with the charging cable attached to my laptop.When I held the ear bud in place, the sound was really good. Nice bass and treble. Sounds more expensive than it is. The single multifunction button makes it easier to use. No more trying to remember combos to press to go between music and phone, etc.The addition of the  extra wired ear bud so you can listen through both ears makes it a step up from your standard single ear headsets for listening to audiobooks or music. You just plug it in to the micro USB charging port and now you can tune out the world!This is a well built, well thought out package. You get everything you need, plenty of covers, ear hooks, charging cable, extra ear bud, all packed in a sturdy box.  I can't even complain about the instructions because they were some of the best I have seen. But still, I can't use it because it won't fit.Like I said, I received one of these in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"I have a pretty stressful lifestyle. I am a caregiver and I have to be on top of my game all day long. I have so much to remember during the day, the last thing I need is to get brain fog. When Root Down Supplements asked me to review their Focus Max, I couldn't turn them down! I received a bottle of the Focus Max in exchange for an honest review, and honestly, these work for me.Easy to take, just one capsule a day, and it keeps me mentally sharp. I don't get any jitters or stomach upset with these. You really don't notice that you are taking them. You simply go about your day with a feeling of, well, focus!

"I have had a digital read thermometer since they first came out. They are so much more user-friendly than the old style mercury thermometers I grew up with. When VIVE Health wanted to send me their thermometer in exchange for an honest review, I couldn't help but give them a try.Just like every other product from VIVE, I was very pleased. Yes, it is only a digital thermometer, but they add just the right details to make them a step above. Some of those upgraded details follow:For one, the size of the display is perfect. I already have to use OTC ""readers"" in order to see most print. Except for this thermometer, that is. The numbers are large enough to ready easily. When a loved one is sick, you want this information now. Not after trying to decipher tiny numbers.Another plus, the tip is bendable. Not a lot, they only recommend no more than a 45 degree angle, but that is more than enough to make this thermometer feel so much more comfortable in your mouth.When you use a thermometer, you typically use it only once every 30 minutes. What you are looking for is an up or down trend in temps. I tend to forget, unless I write it down. With this one, when you turn it on, it automatically tells you the last temp reading. Nice! And after 30 seconds, it automatically shuts itself off.I tested it's accuracy against another brand of digital read thermometer and also a store brand. All of them read within 1 degree of each other. As far as I'm concerned, that is close enough. If I think either myself or a loved one is that sick, especially with a fever, I err on the side of safety anyway and get to the hospital when it gets up there.You know how fussy kids can be, especially when they are feeling ill. This reads temps in only 8 seconds. You get confirmation by a series of 5 beeps, telling you it's ready.Lastly, it's waterproof. I mean, duh. You know you need to keep this thing clean, right? I don't want to only clan the tip, I want the entire thing sanitized. Bingo. Here ya go. I saturate it with alcohol and wipe it dry. Done.This is now my go-to thermometer. Pretty obvious why.

"If you have a barbecue ""chef"" in your circle, this would make a great Christmas gift! I received one of these in exchange for an honest review, and this one really impressed me.You get everything you need in one nice box. The fork actually comes in two separate pieces. The forks snap onto the handle, and are easily removed by a push of the button. This makes is super easy to make sure the forks are clean, since this end can be thrown in the dishwasher. I've used these at least 6 times over the last couple of weeks and each time the end was thrown in the dishwasher. No problems with reading temps or temps being ""off"" after washing.I compared this thermometer against another brand of probe thermometer. Both readings came out within one degree of each other, which is good enough for me.The handle fits nicely in your hand, even if they are small like mine. It would have ben nice if it was a little more ""slip resistant"" when your hands have BBQ sauce on them, but it's not a deal breaker. The smooth surface actually makes it easier to wipe down with a damp cloth to clean it. No dishwashing this end!The handle not only has the built in thermometer, but it also has a timer. I use the timer as a reminder to ""check the grill"". I have a tendency to get side-tracked while grilling. Next thing I know, the food's on fire. This way, I set the timer for 3 minutes. when it goes off, I go check the grill. Easy.and right on the end of the handle is a metal loop just for hanging.The only ""issue"" I had, which really isn't, was that you don't have the ability to shut off the display when you are done.

"Now here is a nice, lightweight kitchen scale. The top is made of smooth glass, making it easy to clean up spills. The size is a little large, but having the bigger footprint makes it easier to use all of my different sized bowls/containers. It measures 6.5"" wide, 8"" tall and 3/4"" deep, so you can see you have plenty of space to use even large bowls.In the box you get the scale and two AAA batteries. Nice touch to get the batteries needed! The instructions are printed right on the back of the box and easy to follow.Super easy and intuitive, you really don't need any directions. If you have had any scales in the past, this is really no different. You have the ability to tare using any container  by simply placing it in the center of the scale and pressing the power-zero button.  The display will read 0:00. Once you add your first ingredient to the bowl, you can simply press power/zero again and it will tare with the new weight. Now you can add the next ingredient, knowing you got the weight perfectly. When baking, I've learned that I always have to use a scale, and after using this one, I found the results were just as good as if I had used my other scales.The scale has 4 weight displays. Each press of the unit button takes you through them: pounds:ounces, fluid ounces, grams and milliliters. The max weight is way more than I personally need. It will hold up to 11 pounds, and I can't imagine trying to weigh anything in my kitchen that weighs that much. A giant prime rib maybe. Or turkey.When you are done, just press and hold the power button for a couple seconds and the display goes out.You need to make sure you place your item in the CENTER of the scale. Just like any other scale, this will read ""off"" if you just put the item on a corner. I compared this scale to one I had already owned, and the measurements were exact. When I placed a true 1 ounce weight on the scale, it read 1 ounce.I received this scale in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion. Honestly, it is just as good as my more expensive model.

"I really love the large print edition! The 12 point print makes it so much easier for me to read. I normally read with OTC reading glasses (+1.5). The larger print makes it easier for me to look up passages without looking for my ""readers"" first.This is a hefty Bible. Coming in at 2.8 pounds, this isn't a lightweight. At 6.5"" x 9.5"", it is just smaller than standard paper at 8.5 x 11"".  It is almost 2 inches thick. With small hands, it takes a bit to maneuver this around. I do better using it on my lap/laptable, laying it out flat, which it does nicely. Open it up to the Book of Genesis 1:1, and it will lay flat without having to hold it open. This makes it a great resource for Bible study, since you can leave it open to any page and it will stay there!My only complaint is the thinness of the paper. It is almost see-through. You can see the print on the back side, but to me it does not interfere with the reading. I understand why they need the paper so thin. If the paper were any thicker, this thing would weigh over 3 pounds, if you could put both the Old and New Testament in one volume!

"I recently discovered that the best probiotics for me actually help treat my CIC (Chronic Idiopathic Constipation). This is one of them. When taking these for the last 20 or so days, I have had very little problem with my CIC.Before I tried these, I stopped taking my other probiotic for a couple of days. Not sure if it does any good, but I thought I would try to get a ""fresh start"" on these in order to really see that they are working. I started taking them following their 2 pill-per-day intense support method for the first 5 days. Then after I realized they were working just fine, I switched to the daily maintenance and took only 1 pill per day. Whether taking 1 or 2 pills made no difference to me, both methods seemed to have relieved a lot of my CIC symptoms. I had no problems with upset stomach, bloating, gas, or any other issue that may have been brought on by the probiotics.The only reason for the loss of one star is the pills themselves. I have trouble taking pills. These are a ""grainy"" tablet. There is a reason for the graininess.

"I'm going to come right out and just say these are every bit as good as my Fiskars that are an almost identical match to these shears by Gardenite. When you first feel these you know that you are getting a high-quality product. They feel heavy-duty. I've been using this for about 2 weeks on my flowers, vines and roses. It's fall and I'm doing tons of cutting. These shears have held up every day. They are just as sharp as the day they arrived. The tip comes down to a perfect point. You can do some serious detailing with these, even though they are so heavy-duty.The rubber grips work great. Whether I had gloves on or just barehanded, the shears always felt solid in my hand. Not like they were going to slip out of my grip. After a couple weeks of use, the rubber still looks brand new.The ""lock"" is easily released. After getting used to the feel of these in my hand, I could use it one handed.While trying these out,  I had to cut some 1/2"" vines (they only recommend up to 5/16""). Typically I wouldn't have tried this since my Fiskars are more expensive than these. Even after cutting 2-3 heavy vines, the shears did not ""spring"". You know, when you overdo it and then they never cut straight again? I've ruined more than my share of shears doing that, but these held up. I would not recommend doing it, but I had to give it a try. I now know that if I stick to just the recommended 5/16"" stuff these are going to last for years.I use alcohol to clean my shears after using them to remove any contaminants that I might spread through the garden. They shined right up and still look new.

"I was able to hook this up to my Canon T1i in seconds. The 3 foot cable is heavier than I thought it would be. I was expecting a light, flimsy cable that you would be afraid to bend, especially for the price difference between the actual Canon shutter release and this one by Neewer. Not so. The connections are also solid built. It feels like you can really use this cable without worrying that it will break at connection points.Once connected, press halfway (you can feel it) and the camera will focus, displaying exposures, etc. just as if you had done a half-press on the camera itself. Press the rest of the way and you got your shot. If you have it set for continuous shots, pressing on the button will just keep the camera firing away. I was able to use this for some lunar eclipse shots and it worked flawlessly, just as expected. I set the camera for bulb and used the ""lock"" on the shutter release to capture photos with no shake or vibration whatsoever.I've used this probably 40 to 50 times and it still is working perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE8M0ALT81M7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044BYKI4#wasThisHelpful","RE8M0ALT81M7X","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm 50 years old, 5' 6"", 130 pounds, 36C. I received the large size and it fits beautifully. The girls are flattened out against my chest, with just a bit of separation. They might be flattened out, but the bra is still comfortable!The Spandex does a great job of holding the girls in place for light aerobics or just wearing around the house.The stitching is all well done. You would expect to pay a lot more for a bra of this quality.The moisture wicking, although I'm not sure of why, works like a champ. Sure, you'll still sweat and it will get wet, but not ""soggy"".I know you aren't supposed to dry this in the dryer, but I did anyway, on high setting, just to see what would happen. Nothing. The bra still fit as well as before and was just as comfortable. I'm not going to make a habit out of doing that, I just know that eventually those kinds of ""accidents"" happen where stuff like bras get unknowingly tossed in the dryer.  I'm really glad it came out ok!After wearing this for a few workouts and just lounging around the house, I didn't have any chafing, no itching, no binding, etc. Also, the bottom of the bra does not roll up, like some others do. The band is just wide enough to keep it from rolling, but not as if you have a thick belt wrapped around your chest.I have to disclose that I received this bra in exchange for an honest review.

"Just like every other piece of jewelry I have received from Orrous & Co, this one is set to impress! I received a set of these beautiful butterfly earrings in exchange for an honest review. And, as usual, I can't help but give it 5 stars! Here's why:Unless you really know your stones, I can't tell these are CZ. Even when someone would really look at them, they couldn't tell either. They would just ooooh and ahhhhh, then ask if they were real.They are perfectly sized to fool everyone into thinking it could be real diamonds. The stones are not so large that they look like they cost as much as a house! The 40 stones are well defined and stand out. These are more than just ""chips"".The earrings sit perfectly on your ear. No drooping or pulling.The shape/design of the earrings allows the maximum amount of light behind the stones, making them shine and prism just like real diamonds.The stones are not on some cheap or flimsy setting. The setting is heavy enough to hold the stones securely without being overly large. The setting does not detract from the look of these earrings at all. The 18K white gold actually helps with the shine. The backs hold the earrings in place securely and I never felt like they were going to fall out.These are sized and styled perfectly for either a night on the town or just a casual coffee chat. They go as well with jeans as they do with the little black dress. They measure about 1/2"" wide x 1/2"" tall, so you can see that they aren't large and ""gaudy"".The perfect gift for anyone who loves jewelry. Even the box is nicely done. The only markings on the black velvet covered box is on the inside. The Orrous logo stands out and makes the presentation even nicer.The price. When reviewing these, the price is only 16.99. They look like you spent way more than that!

"I must admit that when I first received this item I was skeptical about how well it was going to actually work. It really isn't all that big in size and is just plain white. I pulled out the instructions, filled the tank with water (using the included measuring cup), added some lavender essential oil and plugged it in. One press of the light switch and the colored light show began. One press on the diffuser switch and the mist started shooting out. Instantly I could smell the lavender! I'm impressed!I have used other diffusers before and this is by far the smallest I have seen. Being all white, it just disappears into my dcor, only coming into view if I set the diffuser for the lightshow. You can set it for one color only, or have it rotate through the colors. I leave it on the changing colors. Watching them fade in and out is soothing in itself. You can also turn off the light if needed.You can also set the diffuser itself. One press turns on a green light which will shut off the diffuser after 3 hours. This is the setting I use. Built in safety feature in my opinion. When you start with the max water, there is still enough liquid in the bottom of the tank after 3 hours that you don't have to worry about it running dry. I just make sure to fill it before I turn it on. One more press of the button and the green light turns red. This is continuous mode. I haven't tried it yet, but I think if you left it here it may run the tank dry. The vague instructions make it sound like it will shut off if it runs dry but I cannot confirm that.Another ""safety"" feature is the bottom-heavy build to avoid tip-overs. The tank, even when filled to the ""Max"" line, has more than enough volume to contain the liquid if it is bumped or tilted  when taking the top off.This has an amazingly cool mist. You can put your hand right in the mist and barely feel it. I've used it now for at least a week in the same location and I don't see or feel any ""residue"" from the droplets. If you are concerned about setting it on a piece of furniture, then you might want to just place a small towel in front of the unit while it is on. Another tip would be to angle the nozzle so it is aimed over the edge. That way the mist is directed away from the furniture.A bonus in my situation is that the room I put this in has numerous tillandsias or ""air plants"". since firing this off, I've seen quite a jump in growth. I live in an area of typically low humidity, so the plants are really loving it too!I received this diffuser in exchange for an honest review.

"I have had a rotator cuff injury going on 6 months now. There's no chance of surgery in my future, so I'm going to need all the support I can get to make sure I don't do any more damage. Here's the stuff to do it: Physix Gear Sport Kinesiology Tape. I received a sample of their ktape in exchange for an honest review.Over the last 6 months, I've tried a lot of different ktapes. I can tell you that this is just as effective as the popular brands out there. I received the same amount of support as the other, more expensive brands. The adhesive is just as strong. It never gave an inch even after a hard days work. No rolling up on the ends, either. There was just a tiny bit of fraying, but that could have been the dull scissors I was using to cut it with.  My advice: save yourself some money and try this stuff.Plus#1: You get an eBook loaded with ways to use this stuff. If you are hesitant about trying it because you aren't sure how to use it, then try this one. This book is more than adequate at teaching you how to do it correctly. I realize there is some skill to this, but hey, I don't consider this rocket science. I tried their way of taping vs. mine. Results: Same-same. I get just as much support. However, their method was easier so I'm switching.Plus#2: You get a set of resistance bands AND the eBook manual on how to use them. Again, if you are a rookie at this, this book will serve you very well. The shoulder exercises mentioned in the book were very similar to what I had been doing during physical therapy, working the same muscle groups.With the quality of the ktape, and all the bonus materials, at a good price, I don't see how you could lose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10KYTU5A6EEGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012G0YSMW#wasThisHelpful","R10KYTU5A6EEGV","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now here is a really nice and light cleanser! I received a sample of the OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser in exchange for my honest review. I must say that I love this just as much as their other products!I have been using this for a couple weeks and my face loves this stuff! I have had no breakouts, reddening, drying, nothing. Just clean, fresh skin. The addition of the Vitamin E and Rose Hip Oil only leave your skin feeling smooth, not greasy or oily like you would assume. Even in my ""T Zone"", it didn't feel greasy.I don't like cleansers that really foam up. I mean, to me, if it makes big foam, then I'm only getting part of the cleaning properties on my face. The rest of it is just fluff. Not with this. You get  beautiful, tiny, bubbles. You only need a tiny bit, about a large pea-sized amount, and you will get your face squeaky clean in no time.Along with those tiny bubbles comes another great benefit; this stuff rinses off amazingly easy! I wash my face at the sink, like I'm sure a lot of you do. When you have a face load of foam, it seems like it takes forever to get it rinsed off. This rinses off so easily you can end up ""over rinsing""!Another plus is no alcohol. Duh.

I take a fish oil capsule as well, and you know how lovely those are. Well most of the CLA supplements out there have a really nasty afterburp to them just like the fish oil. It's not fishy, it's just gross. These don't have the burps! Even on an empty stomach (I know, I'm pushing my luck trying it), it still didn't haunt me later.Second reason: No GMO's. The jury is still out, as far as I'm concerned, as to whether or not GMO's are unhealthy. Why be the guinea pig?

"Now here is a nice bright light you don't have to worry about getting wet! I received one of these LED diving lights in exchange for an honest review.Here's what you get: 1 flashlight, exactly as shown in the description, 1 18650 battery and charger, 1 sleeve for the 18650 battery to fit into (more on that later), 1 adapter for holding 3 AAA batteries (if you don't want to use the 18650), one Velcro strap (for attaching to yourself or other objects while diving), and a wrist lanyard. All of that comes in a really nice snap lock case made of hard plastic with some foam rubber ""egg carton"" style padding inside. The case will hold all of the items, plus extra batteries, your car keys... A few other odds and ends that you might want to keep secure.First off I charged the 18650 battery. You get a unique charger with folding prongs. The battery is held in place by a spring loaded bar, then you flip out the electrical plug. The entire unit sits on the wall, with a red light letting you know it's charging.  Charging takes about 2 hours for the initial charge, and the light will turn green on the charging unit. To insert the battery into the flashlight, you must first insert the opaque plastic sleeve that is included. Then the battery sits inside securely. If you don't want to use the 18650 battery, then just fill the AAA adapter with 3 batteries and slide it in. Minus the sleeve adapter, obviously.The flashlight end cap is also the on/off switch. With the battery in place, you simply screw the cap onto the flashlight. The flashlight will come on when you come to the last quarter turn or so of tightening. When the cap is completely tightened, the flashlight is on. A quick counterclockwise turn and the light is off. Don't worry. Even when the flashlight is off and the end cap is not seated all the way, it will still not leak. the light has 3 O-rings placed onto the threads in order to keep any water out of the inside. I don't mind this set-up, but I would rather have a manual switch instead of the twist-on style. One of the reasons for the 4 stars instead of 5. It takes both hands to turn this on.The light is super bright! If you have had any experience with flashlights that use the 18650 batteries, you already know the difference between your typical AA battery flashlight brightness and these. AAA's are only 1.5 volt, 18650's are 4.2. More power per battery. That said, 3 AAA's will pump out 4.5. But for some reason the 18650 just looks brighter. Not an electrical wizard so I can't explain it.My other reason for 4 star instead of 5: it doesn't float. Without the battery in it, yes, it does float. But add that extra weight of the batteries and down it goes. This would have made a great tackle box flashlight, if it floated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18548JRXHER6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012GY3I1A#wasThisHelpful","R18548JRXHER6P","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have a someone in your life who is a lover of motorcycles or bicycles, here's a perfect gift!I received one of these in exchange for an honest review, and my son is going to love this! He is into BMX biking and loves to wear ""heavy"" jewelry. This bracelet is not some lightweight, thin, barely noticeable piece of jewelry. This is high shine, in your face, can't miss it! The length/width is just what they say, almost 9 inches by about 3/4 of an inch. So you can see you are getting a substantial piece. If the length is too long, be advised that I don't think you could shorten this at home. Maybe by a jeweler, or if you have some skills, but the pins holding the chain together don't appear to come out easily. Since it isn't an issue, I never pursued it any further.The clasp is one of the fold-over styles. It locks in very well, and the fold-over portion is just an added bit of security. It is easy to clasp and remove, but it has enough grip to not just ""fall"" open. In other words, you won't pop it open if you, say, put your hand in your pocket.You get the bracelet in a very nice black padded box.

"After a rotator cuff injury, I need the extra support provided by kinesiology tape. Happy To Go offered to let me try their tape in exchange for an honest review, so I happily agreed!I have been using k-tape for a few months now, needing it for everything from mowing the lawn to washing the car. Any time I have any rigorous chores, I tape up my shoulder. The Happy to Go tape works just fine for me.I always apply any type of k-tape to clean, dry skin. No lotions, powders, sweat, you name it. I make sure the skin is prepped well in order for the tape to stick best. If you skip this step you may have different results with your tape.The tape comes in 2 rolls just as in the description, one black, one tan or ""skin"" colored. The rolls are cotton tape with an adhesive on one side covered by paper backing. The backing is the standard backing you see on most of the k-tape out there. The tape comes off of the rolls easily, and you can utilize the box as a dispenser. It also cuts easily with sharp scissors. The ends do not fray when you cut them. They stay solidly together, making it easier to apply. You get the correct amount of ""stretch"" in this tape. Pulling on this tape feels no different than other name brand (more expensive) tape.The adhesion is just right. I can easily wear this tape all day long without any troubles. One caveat, if your clothes drag across the tape for a long period of time (say, 2 hours worth of lawn mowing), you will get some fraying on the ends (reason for only 4 stars instead of 5), but I have never had it compromise it's effectiveness.I only wear the tape for one day at a time. I understand that you can wear it for longer periods, but I simply prefer to remove it at the end of the day. I can only speculate as to how long it will last since I didn't wear it for multiple days, but even after a day of roofing, the tape was still very ""stuck"" to me! After sweating all day long, it still took some pulling to get the tape off. I really think I could have left it on for at least another full day. I did try wearing it in the shower on a number of occasions and even then it did not lose any of it's adhesiveness.I would gladly purchase this kinesiology tape in the future. The price and the quality make it perfect for me to use without reservations. Like I stated above, I received a sample of their k-tape in exchange for an honest review. I honestly like this stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10TWGRSV4B2B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCUQ15G#wasThisHelpful","R10TWGRSV4B2B9","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any extra storage ideas make me sit up and take notice. When Attmu offered to send me one of their over the door shoe organizers in exchange for an honest review, I jumped at it. I just wish it was a bit bigger.What you get is the shoe organizer and 3 separate hooks to use over a door or closet rod. The hooks are heavy enough to take the weight of the organizer fully loaded. I had no trouble sliding the hooks over the door and hanging the organizerThe quality of this organizer is ok. The stitching is adequate, but I'm afraid that after using this for a few weeks that I will end up ripping them out. The plastic used for the shoes slots is crystal clear, but made of thinner material. Again, with a lot of use I think you could rip those out as well. The grommets on the top are well mounted and easily fit over the tin hooks.This would be great for a kids' room because my shoes don't fit in the slots. I tried using this as a way to store extra slippers. I only have a size 8 1/2 shoe. I can only get one slipper in each slot, and only the back of the slipper. I cannot get them to go into the slots toe first, as they show in the description. Flip flops, even when smashed together, will not fit in one of the slots.If you were going to use this as simply extra storage, then this would be ok for a temporary fix.

"Just in time for some early Christmas shopping! This snowflake pendant will impress!I received one of these in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, but this is one I would purchase as a gift anyway!The pendant is just right, a bit over 1/2"" in size. The pendant is held by a beautiful 16"" chain with the ""claw"" style clasp. There is even the high style little (about 2 1/2"" long) ""tag"" that rides on the back of your neck. As far as I'm concerned, unless you were some experienced jeweler, you can't tell the difference between these and the real deal. The Cubics are not so large as to be unbelievable, but not tiny, either. Just right to keep em all guessing! There is enough lift from the mount that light gets under the Cubics and really makes them shine. The spaces between the stones make it a versatile piece. For example, I wore this with a black turtleneck and the pendant really showed off the rainbow! The next time, I wore it over a red t-shirt (even casual dress it looks nice!) and it almost looked like there were rubies as well as the cubics!.It looked like I was wearing a different necklace altogether.The necklace is packaged in a sealed plastic pouch, and you also get a nice gift bag.

"I've hit that age where dark circles are a fact of everyday life, not just after a night of revelry. OZ Naturals asked me to review their Eye Cream for Dark Circles and I am impressed!I have been using this for about 3 weeks now. I wish I could have taken some before and after photos, because there is a definite difference. The combination of ingredients must have hit the nail on the head! Not only that, but it leaves my skin so silky smooth! You aren't going to see results right away, however. I had to use this for more than a week before I noticed any real difference, so don't stop using it! My dark circles were pretty bad, if you know what I mean.When you get the tube, you will notice that it isn't very big. Don't worry. After 3 weeks of use, it still feels like I have a lot left in the tube. It really only takes a very small amount. Using too much, like I did at first, actually makes your face feel ""tacky"" for at least a half hour. I use one drop, about the size of a pea to do all of the area around my eyes. If I want to do my entire face, about 2 drops. When I say ""drop"" I don't mean to say this is runny. It is the perfect texture to easily smooth into your skin.I have had no breakouts, no rashes, no reddening, no side effects of any kind.

I'm not looking for just another sandwich holder, I wanted something a little more substantial. This is perfect.This is not just a reusable container like you buy in multipacks at your grocery store. This is heavy duty 100% food grade BPA free plastic. There is nothing ""thin"" or flimsy about this product. It is very well made and built to last.Since I didn't have a picnic planned, I just put in some leftover chicken breasts in the large compartment, and then zucchini and cranberry sauce in the other 2 compartments. As if I was taking this to work.  The zucchini and cranberry sauce still had a bit of liquid in them, but there was no, repeat NO, leakage between the compartments! The silicone seal keeps all the foods inside their own little world, and the 4 large ""clips"" keep the lid on tight!Heating in the microwave is ok as long as you remove the lid as per instructions. 1300 watts and a couple minutes later I had a quick lunch. Right into the dishwasher with the whole thing. Ready to go the next morning.Along with your Bento box, you get access to download 2 free PDF books. The first one, ""healthy cooking Tips"" is a very informative book. Whether you have been eating healthy for years of if this is your first entry, you will find valuable information in it's 73 pages! The other book ""Fun and Delicious Bento Box Ideas for Kid's Lunches"", is 14 pages of tips for fun and unique ways to pack your box. You could easily get ideas for your spouse's lunch as well. One nice tip I picked up is to use lettuce leaves to divide up portions. I'm thinking deviled eggs here. Or you could use lettuce as a ""liner"" on the bottom and sides of the compartments. That way you can get every last portion of last night's taco salad out of the box, even without utensils!I can't wait until Lifemark Labs comes out with more sizes of these wonderful boxes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29D4C2ZXKXJ2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WIXIENC#wasThisHelpful","R29D4C2ZXKXJ2R","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been trying to find a larger sized wallet so I could put ALL of my cards in there. Not just credit cards, but those other pesky cards that get lost. Like my library card, or my AAA card. Now I have room for them all. I received this wallet in exchange for an honest review and I am so glad they picked me to review it!If you're like me, you love the feel of real leather. You will get your leather fix with this wallet! All of the stitching is solid. No skips or ""skims"" on the edges. The snaps on the front and inside and the zipper on the inside are all well attached. One thing I really liked about this wallet is that it has 2 areas for paper money. I like to keep larger bills hidden away from prying eyes in the checkout line, so now it looks like I only have a few dollars.Another bonus is that the interior snap keeps the rest of the wallet from falling open just because you need to get a couple bucks out of the bill slot. The snap keeps all your cards tucked away, again, from prying eyes. Saves you from having to refold the entire wallet every time you need some cash. And since we're talking prying eyes, they thoughtfully made the id window out of a dark mesh. You need to be up close to read what's behind there.Since I don't carry a lot of cards, I was able to put all those cards into this wallet. The card slots are all nicely ""tight"". You don't have to worry about your cards just falling out. You actually have to do a bit of tugging to get them out, which I like.  Behind the card/id area there are two handy slots.  I used one as a holder for an individually wrapped handy-wipe and an eyeglass cleaning wipe. Also, since I don't have an iPhone, I use the slot on the back of the wallet to hold my grocery list and coupons that I will need for that trip to the store. All of my cards and id, all of my cash (not like there's a lot), some coins, a handy-wipe and glasses wipe, and my grocery list and coupons all in one wallet. And I'm not straining to get it snapped! The two outer snaps give you the option of making the wallet tighter or looser, depending on how much stuff you want to stuff.This is a very versatile and high quality wallet. Well worth the price of $37.99 as of writing this review. This is now my everyday wallet. Thank you Winkine for such a wonderful product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V7JZ0WCJ1CMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141ENJJY#wasThisHelpful","R1V7JZ0WCJ1CMR","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After moving into a different home, we noticed the toilets were ""taller"" than we had used in the past. They were brand new, but measured 16 1/2"". That makes it pretty uncomfortable to sit on, given that I am only 5' 6"". I thought my days of dangling my legs from the ""potty"" were over. They were until I bought one of these!I didn't want one of the ""potty stools"" that supposedly put you in the correct angle to ""go"". Those were too tall. I just wanted about 4 inches of height, and that's just what I got.This is a real solid unit. I was able to stand on the edge, hang-10 style, and it did not feel like it was going to tip over at all. I did not attach the non-skid surface, which comes separately in the box, since I knew I was going to put this in front of a toilet. No absorbent pads for me, thank you. I simply place the toilet rug on top of the step. Since it is all plastic, it is super easy to clean. I mainly use an all-purpose cleaner or Lysol to clean it and it still looks brand new.This makes for a perfect toilet step. The wide 20"" platform allows you to sit naturally, rather than having your feet crammed together on a tiny stool.I just wish they made this in a toilet shaped version so it is more form fitting.This has some good non-skid feet, no worries about it skittering away when I step on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GI5H0Q18Q0B8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I9K2BS#wasThisHelpful","R3GI5H0Q18Q0B8","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stop spending money trying to find one of these that works right and lasts more than a year. Just get this one. I received a sample of their 4-way garden hose connector and promised them I would write a review giving you my honest opinions. I honestly love this.Right out of the box you can tell this is built to last. Nice and heavy. 8"" wide, 5"" tall, each outlet just a bit under 1"" apart. Two of the hoses I have attached to this have the larger ""easy grip"" ends just like the inlet on the connector, and there is enough room between them for both to fit. This doesn't feel like it's made of junk metal. The threads are cut clean and are beefy. Not going to be easily stripping these. The on/off valves are big, just a bit over 1 1/2 inches long. Not huge, but way bigger than the little metal ones you typically see. They easily and smoothly turn 1/4 for off/on. The oversize fitting easily attaches either your hose or directly to your outside faucets/hose bibs. Makes a very handy and economical way to increase the usefulness of that one simple faucet!  I attached mine directly to the faucet and then attached a hose to each one. Now I have 2 hoses for lawn watering, 1 hose for a garden sprayer which I also have from Coolife, and 1 short hose for bucket filling rinsing off, etc. right at the faucet. Even with all hoses running, or any combination in between, there were no leaks. None. This is obviously the first season of use, so if there are any changes I'll update as needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YEYC7MT2NCHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011RFN5RQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YEYC7MT2NCHG","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a great, inexpensive way to keep an extra set of these specialty batteries in the home, RV, hunting/fishing cabin, wherever, you can't go wrong here. I was provided a sample of these 18650 batteries in exchange for an honest review. This is my first experience with these types of batteries, and I am impressed.I must make it clear, these are NOT standard AA or AAA or C batteries. These are a 3.7 volt li-ion battery about 2 1/2"" long. They are the same diameter as a Mini Mag flashlight, so you can see that these will only fit into certain products. I use these as spares for a CREE flashlight.You get everything they say in the above description: the charger with two batteries. The charger displays a red light underneath each charging port while it is charging. The light changes to green when it is done. The unit has over voltage, over current, and short circuit protections built in.After I initially charged these batteries, I swapped them out for the ones in my flashlight. they were just as powerful and the light was just as bright. I've had them in the flashlight for 3 weeks now and they still show no signs of dimming. I use the flashlight for at least 5-10 minutes almost every night, so it's not like they aren't getting used.This being my first experience with these styles of batteries, I must say that this one seems to be of excellent quality at an excellent price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q5KFXMYJH5AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOZCYPU#wasThisHelpful","R1Q5KFXMYJH5AV","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There have been so many advances in Bluetooth tech that I'm amazed at the speed and quality of what's available. These are no exception.  Vtin offered to send me a set of these ear buds in exchange for a review and I am very pleased with them!PROs:They don't fall out. You are going to spend quite a bit of time getting these to fit right. they are not your typical straight shot into the ear headphones. These have a ""tilt' to them that, to me, is a step up. The headphones come with plenty of sized ""adapters"" to fit your ear. There will be one that fits. but you MUST take the time to adjust them. after using these for about a few weeks, I found that the easiest way to get them to fit correctly is to ""turn"" the ear bud either clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on the bud while inserting it into the ear. Picture yourself trying to ""screw"" the earbud into place with a half-turn.Sweat doesn't get into your ears. With the newer angle, sweat doesn't even seem to form around them.  After trail running for about an hour, my ears were still dry.They sound great. I am no audiophile, but I listen to everything from Diana Krall to Thousand Foot Krutch and all of it sounds just right. The bass is just a little bit light, but for the price of these, I'll take the lighter bass.Only a couple of buttons to navigate. I like having options, but not when it takes me weeks to figure out the right combos. You only have to worry about a couple of buttons, and they are pretty much intuitive.Long battery life. I'm not sure, but I think I've only charged these twice since getting them. Once when I initially got them, and once more about a week ago. I run about an hour a day, at least 5 days a week and they are still going strong. I never did kill the battery, I just figured it was time to charge. It took about an hour to get it back to full charge.CONs: Only this. The wraparound cord is a bit too long for us shorter folks. Just add a little stop slider to the package so I can shorten the cords to my liking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KXTK34X740F2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111J096I#wasThisHelpful","R2KXTK34X740F2","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been taking fish oil supplements for years. I think I finally found ""the one"".  Here's why:1. No fishy burps, aftertaste, reminders, etc. that you took a fish oil capsule. None. Ever. I have even taken these on an empty stomach with nothing but my morning coffee. Not the best idea, but it was time. I still had no fish breath.2. When you open the bottle, it smells like fresh fish. Not in a bad way. It smells like a fresh fish oil should smell.3. When you open the bottle, you also get a citrusy smell. They thoughtfully added a natural lemon/lime flavor to alleviate what bit of smell and/or flavor there may be.4. At 1370 mg of fish oil concentrate, I only need one a day.5. With all that fish oil concentrate tucked inside each capsule, they are big. Thankfully, they give you a capsule shell that doesn't immediately get stuck on your tongue or in your throat when you try swallowing them.6.

"You have no idea how much you need something until you have it. Then you wonder how you ever lived without it. Here's an example of one of those. They sent me one of these in exchange for a review and now I take it everywhere.I have a ton of water bottles. Where are they? Sitting in a cabinet in the pantry. They do me no good when I decide to take an impromptu hike through either the woods or the mall. Now I have a water bottle on hand and ready for adventure.Folded up, it measures about 4"" x 4"", so if you're like me, you have enough room in your purse/backpack/briefcase/book bag to easily carry one of these with you. Put one in the car, the rv, you get the idea.There is a handy silicone rubber band attached to the bottle to hold it neatly rolled up. A clip lets you attach it to your gear. The cap is heavy duty and seals completely. The outer cover snaps down and makes such a good seal that if you squeeze out the air as you roll this up, you can close the top cap and it will stay sealed. The drinking spout is generously large. You can get more than a trickle out of this thing! They also added a ""screen"" to the drink tip. It doesn't appear to be removable, if you don't like it, but I love it. I can put crushed ice in my bottle and it won't clog the tip anymore! It also filters out lemon seeds, lime bits, orange bits, whatever you flavor your water with these days. The fill hole is just about right. I can put ice cubes from my ice maker into it, but anything bigger might be an issue.The way this is shaped, you get all of the liquid out of the bottle. Plus, being able to squeeze it gives you enough pressure to spray someone nearby, or rinse off your hands, etc.I have never put this in the dishwasher, although they claim it is dishwasher safe. It is so easy to clean in the sink, I just haven't tried it. Knowing that it is silicone makes me confident that it is safe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TRMGH35CCJHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQE9BDY#wasThisHelpful","R1TRMGH35CCJHM","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has so many uses, I hate to just call it a blanket. Gecko active offered to let me try one of their parasheet picnic/beach blankets in exchange for a review, so I tried it, and I love it!Not having a chance to go camping, I just threw this in the backyard and we had a barbecue picnic. This is not heavy, but don't think that lightweight means poor quality. This is just like the material used for parachutes, so you can imagine its' strength. The stitching is all very well done. Pulling on seams didn't create the gaping hole that you get with inferior products. This thing is big: 6.5' x 7'. Spreading it out on the ground, it easily accommodated all of our picnic supplies.The corners have large pockets for filling with sand, but I just filled it with a few heavy stones so the wind didn't move it. There are also large elastic ""rings"" sewn into the corners. You could also use tent stakes or even sticks to hold the corners in place. Those rings also allow you to hook the corners onto trees, brush, tent poles, hiking sticks, you name it, so you have an instant sun shade. It is big enough to be able to use half for sitting on and the other half to make into the sun screen. With the snaps on the sides, you can even convert this into a tube tent. With two of these you could open up a world of possibilities! I don't own a pickup, but if you have one, these would make a great way to have a handy bed cover on hand.Spilling a lemonade on it didn't ruin the fun. The liquid was easily absorbed with a paper towel and the blanket dried in less than a minute in the sun. After the picnic, all the little crumbs and other food particles just fell off when we gave it a good shake. Also, all the grass and other debris from the bottom fell off as well. This is a major step up from using actual ""beach blankets"" which stay wet and hold dirt just as well. It was easy to fold up and stuff back in the bag, and you don't have to refold it the same way (like a map) in order for it to fit.Stuffing it all back in the bag left me with a little pillow measuring about 5"" x 8"", definitely small enough to throw in your car, RV, camping gear, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9846Z7U8BTNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X12UC8O#wasThisHelpful","R9846Z7U8BTNL","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These have everything I want in an ear bud: great fit, great sound, tangle-free wires, great price.Fit: they are finally making ear buds ""ear friendly"". Somebody must have figured out that our ear canals don't go straight in, they are angled towards the face. Now they make ear buds that fit the way we are made. This makes for a comfortable wearing ear bud, even on long runs. No more sweat running into my ears. The fit ""adjusters"" that hold the bud in the ear are semi-soft but pliable. The way they hook into the ear is almost imperceptible. Getting these to fit right takes a little bit of time, but it is well worth it. The best way I have found to insert these is to rotate the ear buds towards the back of the head, insert into the ear canal, then rotate forward till they ""seat"" themselves in your ear. I know that doesn't make much sense, but it's the way I do it. Trail running, mowing the lawn, doesn't matter. These babies stay right where they are supposed to be. And, like I said above, they have tangle-free flat style wires. I hate tangled ear buds.Sound: I'm not going to go into the difference between these and expensive brands such as Bose. These are not. But I don't care. They sound just fine to me. Plenty of bass, and no tinny ""highs"". They are very noise cancelling, even when used while mowing. The only small complaint I have is during phone calls. Callers tell me I sound like I am far away from the mic, and I have to raise my voice a little to be heard. I don't use these much for phone calls, so dealing with that is not an issue. Just keep it in mind if you are going to take a lot of phone calls using these. calls sound crystal clear on my end.Pairing was a breeze. My LG Lucky picked it up and connected in seconds. No drops, even when I walked 20 feet away. Also paired it to a Kyocera Hydro XTRM with no problems.The price is right on. You can spend a ton more on a set of Bluetooth ear buds, but I just have to ask why? I use these for running, about an hour a day. My concentration is more on my running than the music anyway. They sound good and they don't break the bank.  Win-win.My complaints. Yes, I still love them, but I have just a few measly issues. I wish they came with a case. Something to keep them in when I'm not running. I wish they had a ""slip ring"" on the wires. Some way to take up the extra slack. Like the old chums I have on my sunglasses. I wish they lasted more than a week between charges. It doesn't take long to charge them, only about 2 hours. But they only last about 4-5 days on a charge. In their defense, though, I can keep track of the battery level of the ear buds with my phone so I never leave the house with a dead set.I received a pair of these ear buds in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UWBWD318E7WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WR8Y1H6#wasThisHelpful","R2UWBWD318E7WA","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a great way to introduce yourself to the portability of the sun! I was offered one of these in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. I couldn't be happier!My first intro to solar powered anything was a unit that was designed to keep RV batteries charged while camping. Heavy, awkward, prone to breaking, and flat out did not work unless it was lined up just right to the sun. Forget that. Right out of the box you will notice that they are serious about their stuff. Well built, heavy stitching, heavy covering... You can see that this is built to be used and to last. I had a Kyocera Hydro XTRM that was at 30% battery so outside we went. I set it up directly in the sun, obviously, to get the best results. It unfolds easy and it is so user friendly you don't need instructions. The 2 USB connectors are on heavy duty cables that just clear the top of the handy storage bag, making them easy to get at and manipulate. Plugging in my charger cable to the phone, I was able to put the phone and all back into the storage pocket. That really helps to keep your phone cool!  The phone was off when I started and after losing track of time, I finally went back after 2 hours and the phone was fully charged. I can imagine hanging out in camp, charging up my phone while I take care of camp business. I also tried it with my LG Lucky at 50% charge on a mostly cloudy day. It took about 4 hours to charge, but it still charged up.Folded up, this measures about 7.5"" x 10"". Unfolded it is 31.5"". It weighs in around 2.5 pounds.

"I need a supplement that will help me recover from my trail running workouts. I found it. I am 49 years old and have beat my body practically to death. But I just can't seem to stop the running bug so my achy, sore muscles need some relief. When PCNL offered me a bottle of their L-Glutamine in exchange for an honest review, I couldn't say no.I started by taking 2 capsules when I first got up in the morning on an empty stomach, then 2 more after my workout later in the day. I had no stomach upset or any other side effects.If you work out and push yourself like I do, then you understand what it means when I say that sometimes I get so sore that I can hardly get up out of my recliner. Just going from my chair to the kitchen is a workout in itself. After taking these for about a month, I can honestly say that my soreness is significantly less. I have been taking this along with PCNL's L Arginine. Muscle recovery is one of the benefits of L-Glutamine, and they are not wrong. Even running the next day wasn't as bad. Normally it takes me at least a mile to warm up when I'm sore, but within a couple hundred yards I was relaxing into my run.Of course, when your muscles don't hurt so much you are able to do more. When you do more, you see physical increases and improvements sooner. While taking the L-glutamine, I turned in some of my best times ever since I was able to concentrate on running and not on hurting. Not only that, I lost some weight without even trying. I can only imagine that if I had noticed that little benefit sooner I would have lost even more!Along with your L-glutamine, you get a free e-book that explains the basics of the supplement and why you need it. It is easy to read, no PhD. required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZMVSUI0F96RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJS6GNA#wasThisHelpful","RZMVSUI0F96RL","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a darn-near 50 year old woman who loves to trail run long distances. So I guess it's needless to say that I get sore, achy muscles from discovering challenging new trails. When PCNL offered me a chance to try their L-Arginine in exchange for an honest, unbiased review, I had to give it a shot.There are a lot of supplements that say they will give you relief from your workouts, but this one comes through. If you are into any kind of exercise, then you know how your body feels after a hard session. In my case, all of a sudden standing up, sitting down, and squatting become enemies. I started taking the L-Arginine along with PCNL's L-Glutamine. Now I won't tell you that the ""morning after"" aches were completely gone. There were still some reminders of a rigorous workout. But I didn't have the ""can't get up out of the chair"" experiences like I've had in the past.Not only that, but when it was time to go for my daily run, it didn't take me a mile to get warmed up. Within the first couple hundred yards I was already relaxing into my run. When I hit that first hill, it wasn't as daunting. My lungs didn't feel like they were going to explode by the time I got to the top (1 mile, all uphill). In fact, I turned in some of my best times this year!Another bonus was a bit of weight loss. I started out about 10 pounds over my ideal weight. I haven't been really trying to lose the weight, and I wasn't. I had been hovering at the same weight for about 2 months. The month I took the L-Arginine, I averaged a half pound a week loss, without trying at all. My diet and exercise routine stayed the same. Maybe if I had noticed sooner, I could have shed a bit more by actually working at it.PCNL also offers a free e-book covering the basics of L-Arginine. Excellent read. You don't need a doctorate to be able to understand what this supplement is all about and how to best utilize it.*edit* Forgot to mention my daily intake of the L-Arginine. I'm 5' 6"", weigh 127 pounds (now!) and I was taking 2 capsules about 30 minutes before breakfast and lunch. I work out about an hour after a light lunch high in protein.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KJUJEDLX5B2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJS67UM#wasThisHelpful","R1KJUJEDLX5B2B","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can run this necklace through your hands or slide it back and forth on your neck and you won't get ""sawed"". And the nice thing about titanium: it weighs less. You get a beefy looking necklace, without the weight.The price: wow. For a necklace this nice, you would spend a bit more! Quite a bit actually. No tarnish, no polishing, heavy-weight...  You can find cheap knock-offs for about 20 bucks in the big box stores, but they're not going to last nor maintain a shine like this does.You get a really nice necklace, packaged in an upscale black box with a felt padded liner.

"Now this is a really nice way to step-up your shopping trips! I received one of these backpacks in exchange for a review. They were kind enough to send it so when it arrived we went shopping!When it arrived, your first impression is that this is a very expensive bag. Well wrapped, it comes in a protective fabric sleeve like you see the high-end bags in.The faux leather material is butter-smooth! Unless you are really into leather, at a distance, this looks like the real thing. The feel of it would only confirm someone's suspicion that this must really be leather. the stitching is well done and heavy duty. the only thing keeping me from really loading this up is the straps. They are adequate and look really nice with the bag, but they are a little thin. I'm 5' 6"" and the straps adjusted to a perfect size for me, with plenty to spare if you are either shorter or taller.The front pocket has a magnetic button closure. The straps on the front could be used to hold a jacket or other item, but they are there mainly for decoration.  The main pocket zipper is plastic, but so far it has held up to a week of use. The two big pull-tabs on the zippers make it real easy to open and close. There is a 6""x6"" zippered pocket inside the main compartment, as well as 2 open topped pockets for keys, etc. The bottom of the bag is about 4"" thick, so you can imagine the amount of stuff you can put in here. Yes, you could put a tablet or a smaller laptop/notebook (my Dell Venue 8 Pro was swallowed up by this thing), so it could also be for back-to-school as well. The entire interior is well lined, and pulling at the edges, I could not get the fabric to tear as you see in so many cheap bags where the liner starts to tear away as soon as you load the purse.I like my bags to stand up on their own when they're loaded, and with the wider bottom, this one will stand up just fine, as long as you load it correctly. I didn't use it as a book bag, so I'm not sure if it would stand up with books/notebooks/etc. inside. The addition of the handle on the top is also a big plus since I can just grab and go, and not fish around for the straps.The price of this bag is great! While shopping in-store, I found one similar that was $65, and it was faux leather as well. For an easy way to change up your everyday casual look, here ya go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WDD7U69PLSJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFX4ZMC#wasThisHelpful","R1WDD7U69PLSJU","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received one of these scratching posts in exchange for an honest review.Do you have furniture? Do you have cats? It's a natural instinct and healthy for cats to scratch, so give them something you WANT them to scratch on and you will save your furniture! My cats were taught at a young age to scratch only on horizontal surfaces. We bought those cheap scratch pads and praised them every time they used it. So when I introduced this to them, they didn't really take to it at first. They are both adults (5 and 6 years old) and set in their ways! Then they slowly started to try out the scratcher. They don't use it much, but they do use it. They have not tried any other vertical surfaces so I guess the furniture is still safe!They loved the ball on top! The feel of the jute covering along with the rattle sound drove them crazy! And one of them loves to curl up around the base and nap on the soft fabric.This was super simple to put together. You simply need a screwdriver to attach the post to the base and it's done. and it doesn't look bad sitting in the living room, either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M5GEXV94UISK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TA38F8M#wasThisHelpful","R1M5GEXV94UISK","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided one of these shower curtains in exchange for an honest review.Right on! What a beautiful shower curtain! I love the minimalist look to this. Just a nature silhouette. A very subtle way to ""dominate"" a room, I simply use this as the focal point. Everything else in the bath is either black or white to match. How simple and affordable!I would recommend hanging this with a shower liner. The curtain can then hang freely outside the tub. It is waterproof, but after a long shower it's effectiveness dissipates. This is NOT a plastic liner. It is a very smooth feeling polyester, almost like silk, so you know it won't shed water forever.The curtain fits a standard tub/shower. I have mine hung on one of the curved rods and there is plenty of coverage.The material, as I said, is a lightweight polyester with good stitching all the way around. The top is doubled over to make it double thickness for extra sturdiness. The metal grommets are large enough to accommodate any shower rings. You get a set of plastic ones included, which would make this a great housewarming gift as it would be the full set. Nothing else for the recipient to buy. However, they are not that high quality, so I would recommend using others. My personal favorites are the ones with the metal rollers.The price is perfect.

"My shoulder hurts. After an MRI, I have Grade 3 rotator cuff tear, grade 2 acromion. According to the doc, it's pretty serious. Yeah. I coulda told you that. So on to rehab. I was warned that it was going to be fairly painful, and it was. I was doing rehab for about a week, then I got an offer to try Nervia. It claims to help with ""inflammation"" so I gave it a try. I received a free bottle in exchange for an honest review.After 3 weeks of rehab, all my doc can say is ""Wow"". He is amazed at the speed of my recovery. In fact, he even said that if he hadn't seen the MRI he would not have believed that there could have been that much damage. I have full range of motion, albeit still with some discomfort. Was it the Nervia? I don't know. That was the only thing I added to my supplement regimen, and the only change to my diet. Now I KNOW that I am not HEALED.  What I think happened was that the Nervia was able to relieve a lot of the inflammation and allowed me to concentrate on rehab. Less inflammation, less pain. I am in no way a doctor of any kind, so this is just my own personal SWAG.I started with an initial dose of 6 softgels about 2 hours after lunch. Then I switched to 3 softgels  after lunch every day until they were gone. I just ran out so I don't have any comparison yet.I had no side effects. Could not actually tell I was taking them. The pills are large, but at least it is a softgel which don't seem to get stuck as often for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VCF1S0ZI9OT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W24XELE#wasThisHelpful","R2VCF1S0ZI9OT4","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received one of these Mini Food Choppers in exchange for an honest review.Chopped garlic? Not so much. I typically buy those pre-chopped garlic in jars. So why do I love this one? Jalapeno chopper! I make a lot of fresh salsa. 2-3 days a week. That means we have a lot of jalapenos to chop. It's way too time consuming to do by hand, and using a ""blender"" type chopper leaves me with everything from chunks to minced. Enter the mini food chopper.PROs:Solid build. I've been using this for a few weeks now and it looks brand new.Evenly chopped pieces. All of my jalapenos turned out the perfect size. None of them were smashed.Nice size food catcher. The little catch cup will hold one very large jalapeno. The cup slides out easily.Sharp blades. These are very, very sharp! It may look like a simple ""toy"" but it is not!Easy to clean. You see those little green pegs on the lid? You would think that this area would fill with food particles. And you would be right. But they already thought of that. The dark colored plate that lays just underneath those pegs is actually a cleaner. When you remove the black base, you remove all those little ""bits"" that were left stuck between the pegs.Removable blades. Again, this makes it so much easier to clean. I use an old toothbrush to clean in between the blades.Two styles of blades. A second set of blades makes mini ""julienne"" slices. I tried it with hard boiled eggs and herbs. The herbs get a little jammed up, but this is mainly for more solid foods.CONs:The extra blade holder is in a bad space. Not that they have any option for having it elsewhere on the chopper, but if you grab on to this with your fingers/thumb on the bottom, you can get cut. The extra blades go on the bottom of the unit and do not have any sort of cover. Those sharp blades don't need much pressure and you will be bleeding.Small and compact, easy to use and easy to clean.

"I received one of these rolls in exchange for an honest review.KISS. Keep It Simple, Silly. (OK, you know how it goes...) That's the idea here. How much simpler can it be?You get a roll filled with tiny beads not unlike a bean bag chair. You know right there that this will form fit to just about any position you need. Add on a little ""rack"" and you now have a place to prop your tablet. The material is heavy enough, but I think it would be better if it were a bit heavier. Yes, you would lose some of the flexibility, but for me that's ok.I have a Dell Venue 8 Pro. I have it in a protective case with a flip cover and it still fits fine. I can easily use the touch screen and the tablet stays right there. Nice and light, it doesn't feel heavy on your legs. And speaking of lightweight, you can throw this anywhere out of the way. Great for my RV.You are not limited to just using this on your lap. You can also set it on the counter or tabletop and use your tablet for movie night. You could throw this in the tent in the backyard with the kids and let them have scary movie night out side.Added bonus: Just like the pic in the description shows, you can feed your power cord through the roll. Not only does it get the cord out of your way, it also adds another layer of protection by ""attaching"" you tablet to the holder. The cord goes through a hole in the bottom of the holder then through the roll.Another bonus: Makes a great pillow or lumbar support for those times when you don't need to use a tablet.If you are tired of trying to make a pillow work right, and don't want one of those lap ""desks"" covering your lap, here's a great option. The only downside I see is that it is round. It has a tendency to roll  because of that. Just add some props and you're good to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELQ2NTULITVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9RNATK#wasThisHelpful","RELQ2NTULITVI","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received one of these derma rollers in exchange for an honest review.I have seen these used on those makeover shows where they basically give someone a ""spa day"". What I learned was that the rolling of the tiny needles helps get moisturizers and other facial ""nutrients"" into the skin. Makes sense. The same way I make poke cake. I've read that it can increase absorption by up to 1000 times. Maybe that will get my expensive anti-wrinkle creams into the skin where it needs to be and not just sitting on top.They are also reported to be useful on wrinkles, fine lines, stretch marks,  and acne or other scars. The tiny needles supposedly stimulate the body to produce elastin and collagen. Those two give the plumping appearance, thus relieving you of your pesky lines and wrinkles.Here's what I've noticed so far:1. Super easy to use. Even with virtually no instructions, you get the idea that you roll this thing 4-5 times in every possible direction. How much more complicated do you want it?2. Easily add to your facial routine. This only takes me a minute or so to cover the spots I want on my face and neck. A couple more minutes and I'm done with the stretch marks.3. You don't need any pressure to use this. If you do, you will be sorry. Ouch.4. Expect to get a little bit of redness. You are, after all, poking your skin.5. It really does feel like your moisturizers are going in deeper. Like poke cake...6. You may also get some more burning from your creams. I did, but not so much as to make me stop using either product.As far as results, I haven't used this long enough to tell. I do know that it is so simple to do that I have already made it a regular part of my cleansing.It comes in a really neat case, great for packing. And it also has a cover over the head to keep the needles sharp. You could throw this in your overnight bag for sure. My only complaint is the instructions. As easy as it is to use, the first thing it says is ""Do not re-use head."" Are these for single use? It says to keep the microneedles clean and not to share, which also makes sense. But ""do not re-use head"" to me means that you can only use it once and then you have to either replace the head it or throw it away. I simply clean the roller with alcohol every time I use it, before and after.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MH4YQEBSZYCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWPR274#wasThisHelpful","R3MH4YQEBSZYCM","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is so much nicer than using the old cassette player corded adapter! I have OLD cars. 1994 Ford Explorer for one. Old school cassette player so I just used one of those adapters that plugs into the headphone jack on your phone/whatever. Problem was, if you didn't fiddle around with the volumes on them, they would sound oh so terrible! AND you were limited by that cord running between your phone and the cassette player.PROs:I live in the sticks. I mean remote. If you get 5 miles away from the biggest town, you've got no reception. Even satellite is hindered here because of steep mountainous terrain. So no radio. Pick one of the frequencies on this thing. Any of them. They all work.No more cords dangling around just waiting to get snagged by the driver...  You get the picture.Plenty of ways to listen to music. If you can't get your phone to Bluetooth, or if you have a device that can't Bluetooth, then load a micro SD with WMA or mP3 songs.You can charge your phone using the USB port, so you don't lose the use of the lighter ""port"" for charging.You can use either your phone or the Jebsen to control music functions. You can skip ahead using the buttons on the adapter, as well as control the volume by turning the knob. Plus, using the Jebsen to skip tracks makes more safety sense since you shouldn't be messing with your phone while driving anyway. If they see you using a phone while driving around here, expect to get a ticket.Small enough to throw in the glove box, jockey box, or whatever you call them these days.Once paired, the unit quickly connects to your phone. Like it's sitting there waiting to connect...CONs:Maybe it was just me, but I had a hard time getting my phone (LG Lucky) to pair. the instructions didn't give me much help either. I'm not even sure what I did to get it to pair, but finally it paired.A little too big for my Ford. This fits great in my 1997 Saturn SW2. But if you are familiar with or own an old Explorer, you know how much room you get to jockey stuff around.  If you get it at just the right angle you can slide it all the way in so it makes a connection. Otherwise, you can't get the power. Not that this is a problem with the device, just my vehicle.

"I received a set of these tent pegs in exchange for an honest review.You always need extra tent pegs. Period. I don't care if it's for a hike on the PCT or you're just setting up a portable awning/shelter in the back yard, you need these. Right now I have a couple of them doing long term duty in the garden holding up some gardening string for the green beans to grow onto. Why these?PROs:These are heavy duty aluminum. They are not plastic or those awful bendy-ones that come with most big-box store tent kits. These are up a notch. Yes, if you hit a rock while driving one of these into the ground, it will bend. It's not titanium folks. It's aluminum. You could probably pay a lot more to get one you could drive through granite, but hey, I just needed a few extra tent pegs for just in case. AND to replace those crappy plastic ones from the tent kit.Bright color makes them easier to see. I saw one stuck in the ground just before mowing over the top of it. If it had been dark colored, it would have been eaten by the mower.Long enough. If you have ever used tent pegs in a variety of soils, you know that there is not one peg out there that fits the bill for every type soil. These are a great length and perfect fit for medium/heavy soil. but not so long as to be cumbersome to throw in your pack.Lightweight. Again. It's aluminum. You can easily throw this in the RV for awnings as well as throw some in a backpack.The pull cords are a nice touch. Easier removal from that medium/hard soil. You need them since the little cord notches aren't the biggest. More on that later.Nice carry bag. They all fit inside. Easily. I'm used to getting the Rubik's Cube set of pegs that all fit neatly in a bag. If you can get them all lined up perfectly. Or else you get the bag that rips apart the second you try to fill it with the pegs. Not this one. This is a nice sturdy bag. The pegs won't be poking though very easy.CONs:The cord notches are too ""rounded"". They hold p-cord nicely, but if you were in a high wind or someone tripped over a cord, then I think the notch won't have the ""bite"" it needs to hold the string.No flat spot on top for your hand. Like everyone else, I always try to push the thing in the ground with my hand. 99% of the time it never works but I do it anyway. If you're like me, then you will notice that there is nothing to grab onto to push it into the ground. You almost HAVE to have a hammer, rock, etc. to get one of these in the ground. You will need one anyway so just go get the hammer.Nice pegs at a nice price. Cause you just really should have some of these around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12TAO5YD3D69T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKRRPJE#wasThisHelpful","R12TAO5YD3D69T","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a set of these paracord bracelets in exchange for an honest review.This is a step up from all of those other bracelets. With those you get paracord. That's it. With this, you get at least some semblance of fire-starting ability and a nice, loud whistle.I couldn't confirm if the bracelet had the described 4 meters of paracord. I didn't feel like tearing it apart to measure it. All I know is it is large enough to go around my wrists, which are 7 inches. They are a little too large for just casual wearing, so I use one of them to hold my cell phone case onto my backpack.The plastic clips are heavy duty. The total size is about the size of a large digital watch, about 2"" by 1"". The whistle is loud! As any survival enthusiast can tell you, if you get lost and are yelling for help, your voice is going to give out on you long before your breath will. So why scream yourself hoarse when you can easily blow on a whistle and be heard?The firestarter is an awesome touch. Me, I carry a Bic lighter for survival. But say you lost it. Or you just didn't think to drop it in the pack this morning before your hike and it's now 30 degrees and you are wet and you need to get warmed up. This throws a good enough spark after you get the paint scraped off. You can either use the scraper while it's in the bracelet (nice way to make sure you don't accidentally fling it away in the dark), or slide it out. Either way makes a spark good enough to light a fire. If you know what you are doing. If the conditions are right and you have the right tinder. You get the idea.What a bargain. You find the less-bling versions in stores for the same price as what you pay for these. Sometimes even more expensive. If you want to give these style bracelets a try, here's a great way to do it.My only complaint (cause I just gotta have one) is that there should have been instructions on how to use the fire starter. I already know how to use these, but if you wanted to give this as a gift to a newbie survivalist or local scout, it would be cool if they could take it out and actually read how to start a fire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HV499C4MB83L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q84F520#wasThisHelpful","R3HV499C4MB83L","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received one of these metal wallets in exchange for an honest review.This is sturdier than it looks. When I saw that it was "" ultra thin aluminum"" I wrongly assumed that you could bend this with your fingers. Unless you are the Hulk, I don't see that happening. It may be ultra thin, but it is also sturdy.Ultra thin also means ultra light. I have felt fabric wallets, and especially leather ones, that weigh more than this.The description says that it will hold 6 cards. I was able to squeeze in 10 without having any trouble taking them out. I wouldn't put any more than one card in the end slots, since it can be a little difficult when removing a single card. I am not sure if the vinyl used as separators will last as long with 2 cards in one slot, so use your own discretion.The hinge only allows the wallet to open just a shade past 90 degrees. It does not open to fully flat.Opening and closing are flawless. Even when thrown in my cavernous purse the latch did not pop open. A nice touch is that even if it did pop open, the cards don't just fall out. The vinyl divider grips the cards. If it happens to fall out of your hands while opening, you don't have to worry about chasing down flying cards.The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of it's ""plain-ness"".

"I received a bottle of Viva Labs Vitamin D3 in exchange for an honest review.If you are buying D3, then you already know that it has a lot of health benefits, so I won't waste your time here. You just want to know if these work. Yes, they do. I have taken 5000 IU of D3 for over a year, and have experienced the improved mood and improved blood tests. After taking these for over a month, I can tell you I am still getting the benefits.One item to note, be sure that you are taking a D3 supplement that only uses organic non-GMO olive oil. Viva Labs has got it covered.Here's another benefit: check out the price. For 5000 IU, at 4 cents per pill you are getting a good buy. And once you do buy them, you won't have to buy them for about a year. Only 5 days short.Whether you are just looking into buying D3 or have been enjoying its' benefits for years, this is a top quality D3 that will give you what you need at a good price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UARYK6OMKUJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQKI3W6#wasThisHelpful","R3UARYK6OMKUJ5","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a bottle of Upbiotics Probiotics in exchange for an honest review.I have been taking probiotics for years. I understood the importance of those friendly little buggers in my guts. Now it's all about finding THE one for me. With all of the probiotics I had tried, I knew the biggest improvement I had seen was less upset stomach. Less of the heartburn and bloating that had become so common. But I still hadn't found one that worked any better than the others. Then I tried the Upbiotics.  These will do just fine, thank you.What makes these any better than the others? I have had even less stomach issues with gas and bloating, and outside of a ""blow-the-diet"" day, no heartburn whatsoever. I was still having an occasional bout with other probiotics.  I have also been more ""regular"", something I didn't realize had been ""off"". I really couldn't tell you which of the bacteria it is that is causing the most improvement, but my innards say ""Thank you""!Another bonus, I started out taking the 2 capsules, but was able to drop to just one. I was still seeing the improvements so I just kept it there. That makes these an even better price per pill. If you compare prices, you will see that these are priced lower than most of the others, but don't think that means less quality.And just in case you are still on the fence about trying these, read this, directly from them: ""All 100Naturals Products Backed by Unprecedented Five 100% Guarantee : All products are 100% Naturals | 100% Drug Free | 100% Satisfaction Guarantee | 100% Full Refund If you Are Not 100% Satisfied with ANY Reason in 100 Days | 100% Potency Tested by 3rd Party"".

"I received a set of these headphones in exchange for an honest review.I was hoping someone would come out with a decent set of Bluetooth ear buds for running. Here they are! I love these! I've had others, but the biggest issue I had was the fit. With the stiff wires, it was almost impossible to quickly get a good fit. These feel almost custom made for my head.PROS:Nice packaging. You get packed in a very gift-worthy box the headphones, the charging cord, 2 extra sets of ear bud covers in large and small size, instructions, and a very nice semi-solid zippered case to throw it all in. The case gets 5 stars just for the way you could throw this in your pack and not worry about them getting smashed.Sound quality is right up there with other ear buds in this price range. Bass is a little heavy at lower volumes, but the higher notes still come through.  These get nice and loud if that's what you're into. I like to kinda hear what's going on around me when I run and these actually allow me to do that. You can adjust them to fit tight into the ear, making them more ""noise-cancelling"", or you can wear them like I do, loosely in the ear so I can hear background noises.Fit is just right. I have a smaller sized head. Size 7 1/8 in a hat. Most stuff is made for bigger, average size heads. You know, somewhere between men and women. The stiffness of the wire actually made them ""grip"" my head, and the back of the wires cradled some of the weight onto my neck. I can put these on and off in a flash. And they seem to be shaped just right to keep sweat out of your ears. I use them for running cross country and they are wonderful!The buttons have been minimized! I tend to forget which side has which function. Volume on the left, or right? Now there are only 3 buttons. The typical MFB, multi-function button, and 2 other buttons that control both volume and track. For example, a quick press will skip to the next track, but a long press increases volume. The other button does the opposite. Easy-peasy.Battery life is great so far! It took about 2-3 hours for the initial charge (a red light goes out when it is finished charging), but I've been using them now for about 7 hours and they still show half charge. Yeah, the battery life of the headphones displays on my phone. Nice touch.CONS:Remember those 3 buttons? The MFB is really hard to get to without having to stick your finger in your ear to keep the ear bud in place. Other than that you have to literally take it out of your ear to get to it. This is not a big issue for me since I rarely get a call during a run.If you are really ""into"" music, these may not be for you. I am no audiophile, but my son is and he says that the bass would be a put-off for anyone looking for ""high price-tag"" sound. I've said this before, if you want Bose, go buy Bose (or whatever brand is the bomb these days).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R363C8JS8F0O1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUMPF1O#wasThisHelpful","R363C8JS8F0O1F","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am impressed with these mugs! first off I have to tell you thatI have tried other metal cups in the past and they acted just like I thought they would. Hot drinks scalded your hands/lips/tongue and cold drinks froze them. That's what I was expecting. WRONG!I filled all 16 ounces with hot coffee. Don't worry. These mugs are sturdy, even for as ""thin"" as they are. The handle and cup are well able to take the weight. And the heat. I first noticed that the outside of the mug did not burn my hand when I picked it up. I tentatively took a sip, waiting for my lip to be seared to the rim. It didn't. I was able to actually drink the coffee. A bonus: it kept it hot for quite a while. This is not anywhere comparable to an insulated mug that claims to keep stuff hot for hours, but if you guzzle your coffee like I do then this will keep it just the right temperature.I got the same satisfaction when I tried putting a cold drink in it. It kept it just as cold as if I had put it in a nice big glass.Only 2 cons to these mugs.1: No instructions. No cleaning instructions at all. Since I got these for free as a reviewer I just threw them in the dishwasher to see what would happen. Nothing. They came out clean. They look like they could use a little polish, but I have a 20 year old dishwasher that doesn't have the rinse-aid ability so water spots are normal to me. The description above says not to put them in the dishwasher so I guess you better not.2: Can't microwave in em. Duh, but sometimes I need to heat up my midday mocha while I sit at the computer.100% money back guarantee and a 2 year warranty.

"I received one of these money trees in exchange for an honest review.Got Feng Shui?  This is a cute little gift for those moving into a new place or getting a promotion with a new office space. Anywhere you need your money to grow or at least stay where it is rather than escape through the windows and doors! One way to ""use"" them is to place them in an area devoted to money. Got your ledgers in a desk or a cash register in your business? Place the tree nearby. You can put it in the hallway or near your main door so money doesn't fly out the doors. Place it in the Southeast corner of your home to energize the money corner. The Northwest corner welcomes helpful, ""money bringing"" people into your home. Put it on the East side of the house to energize the wood element which stimulates growth. I'm no expert in Feng Shui and can't say one way or the other if it really works. I just think this is a cute little tree and it would show anyone that you care about their financial future. Nice, thoughtful gift.It would be nice to get this in a giftable box rather than just bubble wrapped, but it is small enough you can find a box easily. The ""leaves"" are all attached with wires so they can be adjusted to your perfect look. If you look at the pic in the description, it looks like the entire tree is golden colored. The trunk of the tree is actually darker, more red toned. Not in a bad way, just don't expect all gold coloring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RITK3H43UIBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RK0C15K#wasThisHelpful","RITK3H43UIBZ","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had other pocket chainsaws in the past. They were basically just a cable with 'teeth"" cut in. What a waste. I would have hated to have to rely on one of those. I received this pocket survival hand chainsaw in exchange for an honest review.This is a real saw. Really. Really sharp and cuts really fast! I had some light thinning and pruning to do around the yard. Limbs were everywhere from 1"" up to 10"". Usually I grab the little gas chainsaw and I'm done in seconds. I just grabbed the pocket saw and went to work. Hey, no more noise and fumes!! It takes a bit more time, obviously, but I was able to get the saw onto limbs that I would not have been able to reach with the gas-powered saw. Just throw the end over a limb and away you go.If you've got a partner, you can even do tandem cutting. You have to have some coordination between yourselves, but it can be done! Just shorter strokes.One concern I had was how to sharpen it later if ever needed. The shape of the teeth make me think you could use a knife file or some other small key files to sharpen it up. There are 92 individual double-sided teeth, so you are going to be sharpening 184 edges. This is going to take a while. I think I'll just buy another one rather than do all that sharpening.Another concern is the ""rope"" they use to attach the handles to the saw. How about using some chain or something a little sturdier? I'm afraid that if you accidentally drag that rope across those teeth a couple of times you are going to have a cut handle. But on the bright side, they did design it so the rope could be removed and replaced easily. The end of the cords is ""friction fit"" into the handles and the S-hook on the saw end could take a lot of sizes of other cords. You could even replace the S-hook if you wanted.Great for camping and survival packs! The carrying case measures only 5"" x 5 1/2"" and has a belt loop. The large buckle clip is sturdy and all of the stitching is well done. The nylon pouch is lined inside, making it shed water like a duck's back.  The saw easily rolls up, very carefully, and fits back in the pouch.I'll never even look at those ""other"" survival saws again. I'm sold on this one! Fast cutting and quiet. It's even a little bit of exercise, if you want to look at it that way. Just use proper form and watch those repetitive motion injuries!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17147HSQ3LTII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHLBFX6#wasThisHelpful","R17147HSQ3LTII","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a bag of this Organic cacao powder in exchange for an honest review.Right off the bat let me tell you this makes the best smoothies ever! The chocolate flavor is outstanding and less bitter than other cacao powders. Now I'm not talking about grocery store Dutch process cocoa sold in the baking section. This has more chocolate flavor. Like the difference between milk and dark chocolate.  If you've tried their nibs, then you will really enjoy this!I know there is a slew of health info on chocolate/cacao out there, so if you want a health lesson, I suggest doing a search. Other folks are much more suited to explaining the goodness of cacao. And with this, I don't see a downside. Nothing added, simply organic cacao.I've tried using this in place of the regular baking cocoa and have come away very pleased! Cookies and cakes, for instance, have a deeper choco flavor without altering the recipe. I simply substituted 1:1. I'm no chef, but I haven't heard any complaints from the eaters around here!I had to try the recipe shown in the above product description for the fruit dip! Perfect way to showcase the flavor of the cacao! Seriously I could not stop dipping into it. I even amped it up a little by replacing half of the cacao powder with peanut butter powder to make a choco-peanut dip. A little pinch of cinnamon and I had a nice spicy sweetener for my coffee! Almost like a Mexi-Mocha.And if you are really adventurous, make your own candy for those chocolate attacks. Way healthier than you will buy at the store.If you just want to give this a try, here's the best deal I've seen. If you check out the price of other organic, fair-trade cacao, you will see that you are getting a great deal. This is a LOT of cacao! I have been using this for about 3 weeks, adding it to everything I could imagine and I still have a lot left in the bag! When I run out, I'll be back for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37MIH097659L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HES9CMS#wasThisHelpful","R37MIH097659L3","A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J5VR1Y5XT8O0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm glad the companies finally learned how to make selfie sticks the right way!  I love how these newer models fold into each other.  Makes is super simple to store away for future use.  This stick has a really nice handle on it and fills very strong.  I've dealt with sticks in the past that didn't seem as such.  Either way, this gets the job done and does it right!  I do have TWO complaints,....actually I have one and my wife has one.  She hates that it doesn't fit her iPhone 6 PLUS (with an otterbox case).  However, that's not the companies problem, but might should be addressed in future models.  My complaint is that when you go to pair it with your phone, I already knew how to do it (from using others) but it doesn't exactly give the best signal to let you know it's in ""pairing mode"".  Normally, the light will blink red/green on blue tooth devices when being paired.  This one didn't do that, it just blinked.  Maybe that's good enough, but I was still slightly confused.

"This is one slick looking pepper grinder!  I've never really cared about pepper much either way, but if I've gotta grind it, it might as well be electric, right?!  Besides, buying just the pepper is much cheaper than the pepper/grinder you get from the stores.  Anyways, I was sort of taken back that it took 4 AA batteries (not included)?  Hopefully this thing will last a LONG time on that set.

Seems like common sense now, but I was still excited!  Seems to grind the pepper nicely.  My only real ""complaint"" would be that according to how you like you pepper ground, the device might not sit level on the counter.  There is a small ""screw"" inside the bottom that allows you to gauge just how fine you want your pepper ground up.  That screw must be in a long way to be able to allow the grinder to sit level.

Simply remove one of the 4 SETS OF BATTTERIES, they include (1 set in each light and 1 extra set per light) from inside the light and take the plastic coating out.  This will allow the batteries the connection they need.  After that, press the ""light"" to turn them on.  They have 3 setting:  Fast Blinking, slow blinking, and constant.

"I love these jeans with the little dragonflies on them. The background is a nice light brown color and the dragonflies which decorate these are an off white color.

"I was somewhat hesitant to try these faceted beads because at their given price the deal seemed too good to be true. When I purchase a bead from any given company, I find that a faceted bead of a matching color generally costs just as much as a regular bead. When I first started buying beads for Murano style bracelets, there were no ""deals"" on faceted beads by any vendor, but that was several years ago.I was very pleased to receive this faceted set. My previous purchases had shown me that a relatively inexpensive faceted bead had a limited number of facets. Thus, the more I paid for a faceted bead, the more facets it had.  That has changed over time. Now, the number of facets seemes to be up to the particular bead maker. That is to say, some beads have more facets than others and price does not seem to be a variable.These are very nice beads.1.  They have a large number of facets.2.  They are as big, if not bigger, than the average Murano glass bead (Some of the more expensive bead makers tend to have larger beads than others)3.  THE CENTERS OF THESE BEADS ARE SILVER PLATED). Generally, good quality beads and charms are sterling silver.  Less expensive items are silver plated.4.  These are not THREADED BEADS:  Some of the more expensive beads are threaded so that if your bracelet comes unclasped, your beads do not fall off. These are NOT threaded.I have certainly not taken any stars off because these are silver plate, nor because they are not threaded. These beads are a good buy because you get a large quantity for a small price. These are a good deal because they are a nice size, have many facets, and you get 6 of them for a nominal fee. The color is good and they look very nice on a bracelet; hence, I recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYH8FJ2F4UKZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PVYTJA2#wasThisHelpful","RYH8FJ2F4UKZE","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"i  am in a Bible Study group that is using this Life Change book on Ezekielas their guide through this book of the Bible,. Prior to this we have done many studies using a different series of books to lead us through various Bible Chapters.I have to admit I was quite tired of the other studies and was looking forward to a change in format.And I have been pretty happy with the Life Change style of presentation. I find that the more salient items are more carefully delineated and, in general, I find the Life Change format to be interesting and easy to understand. Interesting asides are introduced and high points are brought to the fore.My biggest complaint about the other series, and about Bible Study books in general, is that the questions, and points to consider or discuss, tend to be redundant. I gather, that this is to make certain that the main points are well understood. So, I still have the same old ax to grind...there is a lot of redundancy incorporated in this book, but it does not seem to be as extreme as other studies that I have seen and used.These authors do seem to try to incorporate fresh ideas into their work So, I am well pleased with this and do recommend it to others who are in a study that is an overview of the Book with interesting details included along with major points and ideas that any general student should know.I accept that some harping on various points must be done as we are not necessarily scholars, but your garden variety of ""weekend learners.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI3A9RQFKLLYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1615217363#wasThisHelpful","RI3A9RQFKLLYQ","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have purchased five of these crosses with red crystals during the four years that I have been buying Murano glass beads and sterling silver charms. Throughout that period of time this Zable cross with the red crystals in it has been my favorite cross. When putting together a bracelet, I generally put a cross at the mid-point of each of the bracelets I have. And, generally, as much as is possible, my bracelets tend to be mirror images of each other with the cross being the midpoint. Sometimes, this becomes too expensive, so each side of the bracelet may differ, but generally, I have found this conformation keeps me happy and I generally get many a compliment.Although this red cross is not always compatible with a given bracelet, I find that it is frequently OK. If not Zable always offers other crosses, though I always return to this one as a favorite. It makes a statement about my beliefs as well as being a beautiful, durable bead. Usually I find that these stones in a bead tend to fall out, but although I these bracelets go whever I go, These stones have stayed in the cross and have given me no trouble. I recommend it to any who are looking for a beautiful cross for their bracelet or as a gift to someone who llike Murano beads and bracelets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MV9QWPVI0R9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005D98HE4#wasThisHelpful","R2MV9QWPVI0R9L","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two of these pink beads and wear them on my ""Pink Murano Glass Bracelet."" They are beautiful and the craftmanship on the flowers which are hand blown onto this bead are amazing in the beauty they add to an already georgeous pink bead. Each of these is painstakingly crafted of molten glass with the flowers desings and the added petals bringing each bead ""to life."" I am always amazed at the amount of work that goes into each bead. Zable beads are slightly more wide and have more height to them than the average bead. You pay a bit more, but with that extra payment, you can rest assured that you are getting a bead that will last for years. Each vendor offers his own warranty with these jewels, so check to make certain that you know which vendor offers the best deal to meet your needs.Generally they come with a warranty of a few months to a year, so keep a record of which beads  you have and from what vendor you purchased them.

"I bought this bead when I first began making/putting together Murano bracelets. I have had this beautiful green bead for over 4 years now and it is still as lovely as ever. The green is a deep green that absolutely glows when the light hits it.It has a companion bead that is the same design but is blue This green bead and its partner, the blue bead, have withstood many a wearing but show no signs of wear. This is a great bead. You will get years of wear from this exceptionally well made Zable product. I have worn the bracelet with this bead on it while cooking, gardening, entertaining, and partying.

"This is a fairly nice grey bead from Sexy Sparkles. The gray on the body of the bead is a medium gray with the 5 sided flowers a lighter gray. The light gray against the medium gray does not make for much of a contrast in colors;  therefore, the flower petals do not stand out definatively on the bead.The bead has three sets of the lighter gray petals on the bead and in the center of the flower is a sparkling rhinestone. It has been my experience that these rhinestones fall out fairly quickly, though this bead did arrive at my home with all three sparkles intact.The core of the bead is not sterling. It is listed as being ""not rated"" which means it could be plated, rhodium covered, or brass under a gray looking metal. I do hot know for certain because this information is not listed.it is not a screw on center, but is a slide on one.This was an inexpensive bead and looks pretty good for such an item. My biggest disappointment with this is that the body of the bead is a medium gray which gives little contrast to the light flower petals on the bead.Also beware, though there are two pictures of this bead, this is not an indication that there are two beads. One picture simply shows the bead lying down, while the other show it standing up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R350RE4BO0686Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C112U1S#wasThisHelpful","R350RE4BO0686Z","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First I bought these in my usual size, but after wearing them for half a day, they had stretched to the point that they were too big. So, I sent them back for the next smaller size. Another half of a day of wearing and they were still to big, so back they went.Finally, two sizes down and they fit.I was very surprised at having to go down two sizes to find the correct fit. As usual, when I first put these on in my regular size, they were quite snug and it seemed like a good fit was on the way. Same thing with one size down. Having to go two sizes down was unheard of in my wearing language with NYDJ.It is good for the ego...to some extent, but hard on the pocket book while trying to ensure that one gets the needed color/colors. Sending back and forth can get tiresome while one is waiting for the correct fit of jeans for the summer that then slides into the fall.Once I find a fit in a certain set of Jeans, it seems to go OK, but I do wish that sizing would be stabilized in the NYDJ department!Once again, in a pair and color that fit, I order another color to fleece out the wardrobe. I used to get Sherrie Petites and will continue to do so, but the cool colors were not in Sherri this year.So, I suggest you buy at least one size down if you are used to Sherri's, but that is almost all the help I can be. I might throw in that I am 5'5"" and weigh 150.  That frequently helps me to decide...if the reviewer is cool enough to add her own Vital Statistics.

"This is another of Doig's wonderful books where one reads from the beginning..first getting a picture od the characters as Doig paints them. Once one has the characters clearly in mind, Doig pull the fishing taut and has the reader hooked. Then one goes through Cliffhanger after Cliffhanger.  What will Mitch do to line up a job after college? He is now married and has ""akid on the way?!""But will he go in with his pot smoking buddy where he can have an easy money job at the same rate of pay as the one he currently has?  Why did his wife take off from him in the first place?  Why do his only two children diespise him when, over all, he seems like such a wonderful guy?Will he die from various fun jobs too close to volcanos?  what about in a tour of Alaska on a seaplane? How about close encounters with grizzly bears?Why isn't he married to his latest live and live-in named Lexa?It seems as if every time Doig slings in another $3.00 word which requires a dictionary to enlighten Gentle Reader that a new twist or turn into the plot arrives...new word/new twist to the book.But ll these twistings and turnings are part and parcel of the fun of reading Ivan Doig. He stays in his own back yard of Montana or, perhaps Arizona when he paints the backdrops of his novels. Then he throws in some uneducated characters to mix in with his hard working ones who have pulled themselves up by their boot straps along with the highly educated crew.  All in all, it maks for fine reading. Those of us at home with his sudden twists and turns find that thise are the reasons we come back to see how his literary fantasy is coming along.I find that the moment he becomes too complacent about stringing the reader along, that I simply ditch that book and go on to the next one. But Mountain Time hooked me from its onset and held me there until the very end. It is never possible to discover how the ending will arrive..on horseback, a destroyer from the WW11 era or on the whispered words of the kindly author. Always something to attract us all for a spin into fantasy of a bygone era.This is a good one.

"I bought this dange from Fine Jewelers about 2 years ago (it is now October 10th, 2015. i have 5 Murano bracelets that I wear ""all the time."" I mean that these are my favorite bracelets and I wear one or two of them almost every day. They do get switched off depending on the colors I am wearing., but the beads on these bracelets are subjected to continuous wear and tear.I have this particular dangle on a bracelet I put together that has 3  different dark colors on it: dark blue, gray, and black. It is a favorite winter wear, or dark color coordinating bracelet. And it has gone with me to meetings, parties, outings with friends and Bible Study. So it has been put through its paces.The best thing about this dangle is that it is just as beautiful as it was the day I got it. After a period of wear, I take a silver cloth and wipe down the silver bail on the dangle. Tjis gets rid of the sweat and grime it is subjected to in the open air. The dangle bal gets rubbed down also. Then I put the Bracelet n an anti-tarnish bag and put it away with my other bracelets.Fine Jewelers has carried this bead for several years. It has been my experience that they always carry only quality products and stand behind their warranties at all times. I definitely recommend this dangle and any other products that hey offer. You will be pleased with the quality of any items you purchase from them.

"I love underwear that has  a little PIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ to it. I can go through the day thinking that I am the Coolest person around because I have on some snazzy underwear...not the old run of the mill white cotton panties that I grew up with...just something a bit out of the ordinary.Bali's Comfort Revolution Brief's have provided me with Secret happiness on numerous occasions. Since these briefs are offered in a multitude of colors and styles, I have had the fun of looking at many of those offered and have found several that are now residing in my own personal underwear drawer.I got the world's best deal on this  pair of panties"": These start at the iop as an almost white color and then as you progress further down the item, stripes of a light pink/orange color until the stripes coalesce into a light salmon color. You can bet that I wear a pair of these under my orange jeans!!Generally I wait until Amazon has a smashing good sale on bras and then I buy one to match the panties. I may not be the most ""together"" person there is, but I surely behave as if I am when I am all coordinated underneath!!How is the fit of these Panties? I find that it is just great...they fit just like they should. The elastic band sits just below my navel and does not pinch at all. Although I wear a size 10-12 in jeans, I find that I am the most comfortable in Panties that are either L-7 oe 8/9 oe 8. You just have to adjust to the maker of the underwear.Personally, I have had to accept the fact that I have a fairly large caboose.The elastic in the legs is in tune with the waiste band of these knickers. It6 is just rught...does not pinch but certainly leaves no gaps either. They fit just right.I am not one to hand wash my undies. Now, I do wash my bras by hand, but the panties go through the asher. THEY DO NOT DRY OUT IN THE DRYER!. I have fouled up too many undies by throwing them in the dryer and I have made that mistake, than k you, and will not do it again. All of my knickers are hung up to dry--either right in the llaundry room, or outside on beautiful days.This particular pair of undies is currently being offered as an add-on item. The price is unbelievably low at $4.ii with free shipping.But, though they may increase in price at some point, they are still worth a few extra pennies. They are cute and fit well...I take an 8/9 and they fit perfectly on me and though they are machine washed, they still fit perfectly after being air dried.I definite recommend these and hope you feel as special in them as I do!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JGJCG22FYA6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UI5BDC6#wasThisHelpful","R3JGJCG22FYA6Z","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was disappointed when I received this CD from Amazon. I have two other CD's by this group which I love to listen to. They are AMERICAN ANGELS: SONGS OF HOPE' REDEMPTION AND GLORY,  and  GLORYLAND. Both of these CD's are sung with a minimum of musical accompaniment are sound like Grassroots Pentecostal music as opposed to the Chant format that the group has grown into.I tried to listen to the music prior to purchasing the CD, but the tracks are listed, but you cannot listen to them as you can in most cases these days. Since The Cherry Tree is a well known song and since the title of the CD  says that these are songs and carols, I had my hopes up thinking I had found another CD of rolicking uplifting music.  (I like Chants also, but was hoping to match the tenor of the other CD's I had).I eagerly opened the package and put in the line up with my other CD;s. It was Chants...just not the sound I was hoping for.With technology as advanced as we have today (Soon technology will bypass the human element and take off on its own course...at least that is what ""they"" are telling us) I find it difficult to believe that it is not possible to listen to snatches of this CD prior to purchasing it. Better interface with the consumer is certainly needed here. Though the CD itself is surely wonderful, the circumstances presented to purchasers certainly falls below the mark of what is acceptable these days. And Amazon makes returns fairly easy, it is still a hassle to send something back, especially since a bit more ""tecnological Thrust"" and this error would never have occurred.Thus, my three stars. This is a CD of Chants...so that others do not have the same experience I have had.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S5BDA2GOU70U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KQKAOC#wasThisHelpful","R2S5BDA2GOU70U","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love thse and have now ordered 3 packages of them. I realize that this gives me six pairs of these, but I love them so much that this number seems totally reasonable to me; in fact, I may even talk myself into ordering two more sets. Why?And in the ""Why"" of this, I am able to see why theynwork so well for me. I am one of those souls that is persecuted with overly dry feet. I have looked for years for something that would give me LONG TERM RELIEF FROM MY DRY FOOT PROBLEM.Initially, I wore these little footies with the balm that the vendor said worked best with them. I had no luck and put these little socks away for several months thinking I had just tried another avenue that did not work for me.Then I tried them with some EMU OUL. In addition to dryness, I was now suffering the pains of Neuropathy. Many said the Emu Oil gave them Relif from their Neuropathy pains. I thought, well, I might as well throw good money after bad and ordered the oil. Within a day, I received a personal email from the Emu Oil Vendor saying what I could expect from the oil (pain relief was NOT noted on the list) however, he said to notify him personally if it did not live up to its reputation as a healing oil.So, there I was with oil dripping from my feet. (Any type of prior planning for this eventuality had not occured to me) when I remembered my little ""dry feet socks.""  Fortunately I had put them in my nightstand. So I recovered them and put them on my oily feet. To my amazement, my neuropathy pain began to subside within ten minutes and within 30, it was gone. My little socks had kept the oil in so that it did not get on my bedding. That was a huge plus. But the morning brought my ultimate gain. My dryn skin began to peel away. First the dry sjin came iff in little dabs. By the third day, it was coming off in strips. I was getting worried that I would have no skin left on my feet, but night after night, I would apply Emu Oil to one foot and then put on my little blue sock with black feet running across it. Then I would do the other foot.It has taken almost a month for all the dead skin to peel away. In its place I have new pink skin with no dry spots in it.I tried putting the Emu Oil on and then covering my feet with little golf socks that I had. That did not work at all. Those golf socks absorbed as much oil as possible and left a mess on my bedding.I learned that my little blue socks were sending the Emu Oil where it needed to go...into my skin and not into my carpet or bedding.I run these socks with Emu Oil on them through the washer. Hand washing treatment is not good enough to take the oil out. So, now I have a pair for 6 nights and will llikely order another set. It is yucky to wear a set that has seen a night's hard work, so I use a freshly laundered set each night. And noe I cannot imagine going to sleep without them. The Emu Oil takes care of my pain and the socks see to it that the oil is absorbed by my skin rather than oiling up the bedding.Now the skin on my feet has changed from ugly dry stuff to a healthy pink thanks to the quality in these socks that sees that my oil is absorbed rather than just making a mess of the bedding.I love thse and wear them nightly. They have made a huge difference in my life. I turns out that these were a very wise purchase and were not good money thrown after bad.  I no longer have to worry about uglyn scaling feet. I can wear sandals any time I wish.  And because of the way these handle the Emu Oil, I now get a good night's sleep because my foot pain is gone.I recommend these to those with a dry foot problem, and, as a bonus, those who have foot pain can wear these knowing their pain cream will be absorbed into their skin instead of onto the bedding where it will do no good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VTZMXUXK29Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ET7M84#wasThisHelpful","R20VTZMXUXK29Q","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful LITTLE BEAD offered by Bling Jewelry.It goes beautifully with its companion bead which is a Sea Themed Sea Turtle Bead also offered by Bling Jewelers.I capitalized Small Bead when I initially mentioned thee Seaa Themed bead which has a thin coating of Gold plate on it because one must be aware that both of these barrel shaped beads offered by Bling are much smaller than the average round bead one normally buys for Murano Bracelets..The length is about 3/4 of an inch and the with (where the holes are located) must be a bit over 3/8 of an inch because that is the diameter of most of the bracelets we wear. So, the hole for the bracelet is adequate but only a bit bihher, perhaps 5/8 of an inch.I noted that the Sea Turtle Bead which is offered as a companion to this one has outlines done in Sterling Silver; however, this one is bordered in gold. The gold attributes are one of the main selling points for this bead. It would probably be pretty drap if it were highlighted in Sterling.My experience with Gold Overlay in these beads is that the Gold wears off pretty quickly. What do I mean by pretty quickly? If you wear this bead every day for a week, I would expect to see the gold worn off at its most prominent features..the ones that get the most wear. If you wear it daily for a month, i would expect all the gold overlay to be gone.I have had experience with several beads with a gold overlay. Some were inexpensive, but the most expensive were $29.95 four years ago. I bought 6 or more small spacer beads from Zable. They bwere all identical. They had small As is this bead, they were all barrel beads and had crosses around their middles. I was brand new to Murano Beads at the time and thought that if I bought an expensive bead/s with gold overlay that they would last and the gold would not wear off.I was very wrong. At the time, I wore my bracelet, which had two of these barrel cross beads on it, all day, every day. It came off only at night. I was horrified to find that the gold began to disappear within a week, and though I was as careful as I could be, the gold was ALL GONE within 3 weeks and certainly within four. I spoke to the people at Fine Jewelers and they were kind enough to replace the two barrel beads I had been wearing continuously. But, they told me, was the way gold was. It was applied very thinly, and I should only wear those beads with gold overlay for an hour or two. I could go to one function with them on, but should take them off after that. Wearing them continuously was sure to ruin them.  I still have those beads, but am very judicious about where I wear them, and for how long.I will treat this gold and blue bead the same way. I will wear it out for an evening, but onece home, I will wipe it gently with a silver cloth to get all human sweat and grit off of it, then will put it and the bracelet it is on in an anti-tarnish bag and put it away. I know that sounds like an awful lot of trouble, when what you want to do is show off that beautiful bead!!! But unless you plan to replace this bead with a new one when the gold wears off, you will have to treat it very kindly.With all that said: !. It is a small bead...more the size of a spacer bead than the usual Murano bead and 2. It's beauty lies mostly in the thin veneer of gold applied to it, but that gold will easily wear off...I still give this bead 5 Stars.I give it 5 stars because Bling makes a good quality product and stands behind their purchases. Most of their beads are purchased as gifts, so even though their product may fail, they will not know of it, but they will stand behind it. Given that you know the potential flaws of this product and still buy it, then you should know to treat it carefully.I bought it knowing the inherent problems, which for me will boil down to this bead requiring more care than the normal bead. Since it is so small, will anyone else even notice its beauty? Sometimes, I have to admit that a bead is beautiful, even if I am the only one who is likely to notice its beauty. And sometimes that is fine. If the only one who enjoys the beauty is me...well.....I am not here to knock the socks off the world...I am here to appreciate the beauty in the things i am given.So, I will wear this bead sparingly and enjoy it every time I wear it. If you are nof the same mind, then I heartily recommend this bead to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KOACHF6Y1MHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK4HX1A#wasThisHelpful","R3KOACHF6Y1MHS","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was one wonderful book. It is written from the perspective of a young boy.The first part of the book is narrated by the boy when he is six years old. He has a father, the Bartender, whom he sees about once a year. He is currently living with his father's sister, his Aunt, who lives in Phoenix. His aunt has two sons who are older and much meaner than he is. All he wants to do is get away from this awful situation.In a dream come true, his father, named Tom Harry, arrives at his aunt,s door one day and announces that he is taking his son back to Montana to live with him. This 6 year old spends  quite a bit of time and energy, woorrying that he will do some Godawful thing that will cause his father to return him to his aunt's home. His other main concern at this point in time is ""Who is his mothwe and will she show up at his father's anytime soon?  This desire to know who his mother is becomes a major thread during the whole book. You, the reader, will not be given this information until the very end of the book.The author cunningly weaves this thread throughout this novel.This page turner progresses from the child at age six until he is twelve. A new and dangerous, or merely curious sometimes, set of events will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire reading of this delicious novel. I read long into the night on this one and yearned for more when I HAD TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN.MAIN THREADS OF THE BOOK:1.  Will I ever get out of this hell hole in Phoenix, i. e. who are my parents and why have I been abandoned?  If I do something wrong will my POP send me back to phoenix2.  Who is my mother, and where is she plus what will happen if she shows up?3. My father is to be called Pop and he runs a Saloon.4. School is intolerable,  I am a smart kid, but there are bullies around5. At age twelve he meets his  best friend and she is a girl. Their ruses and shenanigans bring the reader into a much expanded view of how things can go wrong, or frequently they go right, and what fun can be had in the process6. Fishing: Tom Harry loves to fish and the Kid, not so much7. High jinks at the bar with best friend8. Dad plans to sell the bar...Oh My God!9. An unknown Sister show up and throws the whole group into a tizzy10. The earthen dam at Fort Peck fails and the entire town is flooded..who will go back to their businesses and who will not? Many are killed by the flood11. The Bar stays, Proxie is not his mom, nor is Frances his sister12. Identity of Mom finally comes out13. The end and all is wellI really enjoyed this Read. The action never stopped, characters came and went, but through it all POP and the Saloon were stabilizing forces. I just never knew what would happen next And the ending really did take me by surprise.I definitely recommend this book; in fact, I liked it so well that I am going to give it to my friend who is quite haughty about what she reads: Novels Only and They Had Best Be Good!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E1JJF06JGMVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594631484#wasThisHelpful","R3E1JJF06JGMVY","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been buying these 3 beads as a group for 4 years. It is a terrific deal to get all three at a low price. I could buy each one separately for about $10-$15 or a whole lot more if I was forking out cash for a Zable or SilvaRado bead.I have put together a Christmas bracelet with red and green sparkling beads intermingled with some expensive sterling beads. I have a Zable Snowflake, a Zable Christmas Sleigh filled with gifts, a Zable toy train, Z able Christmas bells, and a SilvaRado GingerBread Man. (I spent an excess amount of money on this particular bracelet because a. I wear it for the entire month of December and b. I plan to wear it as is for the rest of my llife during the Christmas holidays!)I put shiny beads in between the silver charms and love to use the inexpensive sets that Pro Jewelry sells.I know from long experience that these beautiful beads will rattle against one another for the whole month. Whether it is these three beads that I get a bargain on, or rhe really expensive ones such as Pandora and Zable sell, these lovely beads start to loose their little sparkly parts within a day or two. By the end of the month, the sparkling beads need to be replace because they will have lost more than half of their little sparkles.I would say it is planned obselescence, except, I do not think anyone has come up with a glue strong enough to keep the little sparkling gems in place. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL, THEY ATTRACT LOTS OF ATTENTION AND i ALWAYS GET A TON OF COMPLIMENTS when I wear rhis beautifl, sparkling bracelet. It is just part of the deal of having such a beautiful item. It requires upkeep and new sparkling beads every year.When I was a Newbie to Murano bracelets, I thought these sparkling beauties were to die for. But reality came knocking in by the end of the first week of continuous wearing of these beauties. So, I learned to limit the number of sparkles that I wore.But for 4 years now, I have checked in to buy a couple of these sets.I want to sparkle through Christmas and into the New Year.With prices this reasonable, I am able to do so.I highly recommend this grouping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZRDZM084D9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3DOX7U#wasThisHelpful","RNZRDZM084D9N","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lately I have been on a gray kick; that is, I have purchased a couple of pairs of gray jeans, some tops to go with them, and some gray shoes to complete the clothing look.I like to wear Murano Bracelets as accesories to my clothing. But finding pretty gray beads has been quite the challenge. I was looking at other dangling beads when this gray dangle appeared as ""You Might Also Like...so of course I took the bait and got this wonderful dangle.It is rather a a rather small dangle, but I have no quarrel with that as it is just like its' picture.. Its total length from the top of the dangle to the bottom of the pearl is just shy of an inch. The pearl itself measure about 3/8ths of an inch across and 3/8ths of an inch up and down.The silver bail that holds the pearl in place appears to be coated with a substance that prevents tarnish. Be very careful if you should need to clean this. the silver bail that holds the pearl in place appears to be treated so it will not tarnish. Be very careful if you need to clean this.

"This is the second pairTaos Sandals in this style that I have purchased. The first ones were gold and I still have them and still wear themFor me, Taos Sandals are a little bit of heaven on this Earth My feet tend to swell if I am on them for long periods of time: 12-14 hours at a go./ But Taos Sandals like this pair are there to my rescue.For those of us whose feet swell !.  If we stand or sit with them hanging down for 4 plus hours at a time.  2. If we are on our feet and doing hard chores such as lifting heavy objects, cleaning house all day 5. Forgetting to elevate our feet when we are sitting down or not keeping them above heart level while we sleep...the usual things that lead to swollen feet...we know better than to sit down and have them dangling. and we mean to elevate them at night, but then do not...whatever the reason, our feet swell...3. and if you are wearing ordinary shoes, as tour feet swell, so do your shoes, but then when you put your shoes on in the morning, your feet look almost normal, but your shoes are too big.This is where I HAVE COME TO CHERISH MY tAOS SANDALS. These T-Strap style are just perfect for me. These shoes fit in the morning when my feet have no swelling. By 2 in the afternoon, serious swelling has begun, but my feet are still cradled by my Taos Sandals. Even though the swelling is becoming serious by 2:00 PM, the arch support in these sandals still keeps the foot where it should be and, though these are my normal size 7's, they accommadate the swelling and do not stretch out of shape,These shoes allow me to keep up with my duties even though swelling has ocurred and is painfulSoon I will be having surgery to correct this problem, but until then, Taos sandals will be my best friends. (I have had these for use after a couple of other surgeries I had....They contour to the shape of my foot and that gives me a genuine feeling of confidence as I go to take my first steps after surgery. The soles give me traction and, again, these allow my feet to swell, or not, without hurting the shoes in any way.If these get really dirty, I have been known to throw them in the washer on a very delicate cycle, in order to make them look spotless and new. I readily admit that this is strange behavior, but, every couple of years, even shoes need a shower! I do not recommend this as routine behavior, but, as I say, it has been knoe to happer...No dryer...air dry only!These are wonderful, wonderful shoes. They have tread for stability, a finish on the footbed to keep odors away, a nice thick sole with a small elevation that lets you move unfettered without locking your knees, great arch support, and room for a swelling foot if need be. They can be cleaned with a wet cloth, and seem to last forever, no matter the harsh treatment they are givenA sturdy shoe for all seasons","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CYKSCIRGALUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EQ9U2BS#wasThisHelpful","R2CYKSCIRGALUR","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do like this bra. I have lost some weight and I have a new bra size:38C. When I was a bit younger, it was ""just the thing"" to have a large cup size. Showing it off in sweaters was a lot of fun. Sut a stint in the hospital took some flab off of me .  Back when, I would have been devastated to  to find I had lost some in the bra area. Being slimmer all over with this new bra size, I justn look like a sleeker human being...I am not the only one who thinks so...Multitudes have commented positively on the ""New Me""  that is to say others have noticed and made positive comments...I am not just out on my own head trip.So..I initially bought this bra on sale in blue. Apparently they are ridding themselves of this stock, as I now see that the Strawberry color is now for sale at bargain basement prices. Since I am so happy with the Blue/Turquoise colored that I already own, I will now pop foe the Strawberry one.THE BRA ITSELF: is just a plain, no frills garment. The straps adjust from the back and this is a regular ""Back Fastening bra.""The colors are bright and warm, and they launder nicely. I do wash mine by hand and then hang them out to dry..usually in the master bath, but outside when the days are nice.  I hang mine in the shade to dry...avoid putting them in the direct sun as they may fade.One of my arms tends to sit higher than the other..perhaps permanently scrunched up;  thus, I have a difficult time of getting my bra straps situated. I did have a day of drooping shoulder straps, but one I got the straps where I WANTED THEM, i NO LONGER HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.The cups are lightly padded...in this case, that means that the bra will hold it shape while you are not wearing it, and there is enough padding to add 2-3mm to the size of you natural breasts..You will still have a small cleavage if you lay flat on your back, but this is not SSSoooo padded that it looks unnatural. Personally , this small amount of padding is OK by me. I have worn my blue bra under several T-Shirts (no camisole in sight) and the bra shaped me, but did not look unnatural at all.There is no lace and no frills with this bra. It is definitely a ""you see what you are going to get"" j as the picture show Now that I have the bra straps in the ""RIGHT"" places to fit my uneven anatomy,  Now that the bra is all rigged the way I want, it fits just perfectly and the straps stay in place on my shoulders...which is a real hangup for me..For a bra to be wearable (in my own little world of rules) the bra straps must stay put!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ZOXWSHVDS8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IXNVLJU#wasThisHelpful","R6ZOXWSHVDS8J","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one classy belt. The Leather covering on the majority of the buckle really makes this belt look like the Top Of The Line. The leather is sewn on in a sturdy way that makes this belt a real deal. It looks great with just jeans or even a much dressier pair of trousers...You do have to remember that it is one and a half inches wide, so it works just fine on ""Jean Trousers,"" but you may have to get a skinnier belt if you have on Real Dress Pants.I have lost a lot of weight lately and am using this to hold up my pants so I do not look like a gang banger. Of couse it works wonderfully doing this duty, but looks really nice in so doing. It does not seem to matter how much weight I loose, my waiste is stubbornly sticking in at 40 inches. I originally ordered a Medium in this belt, but it just barely made it to the first hole when I put the belt on. That looked awful, so I sent the medium back and got the Large.  A blow to my ego, but the Large looks really nice in the 3rd hole.I do recommend this Fossil belt;  indeed, I have two others of their line and find that they are consistently lovely across the whole line of belts.

"I have had many a visitor to my home lately and ""MY GOOD GUEST TOWELS"" were no longer in good shape.I had tried various towel colors, had even gotten a different Shower Curtain to liven up the room, but the Towels were a disaster and had to be replaced. I was looking over the offering in Yellow Towels when I came across these Turkish Towels.""Why Not?"" I asked myself. If you hate these, you can send them back. I ordered six towels that were not as expensive as these. When they arrived, I was amazed. They are so, so soft, and they are SO BIG..much larger than the standard American Bath Towel, and the cost was moderate.So I took a shower using one and then ran it through the washer. It was a wonderful find.It was softer just out of the dryer than it was when it was first delivered. I had ordered a fairly ""Cheap"" group of towels for the guest bathroom. I reasoned that they did not have to be the most expensive available since they would only be used intermittently. In addition, if the kitties decided to try to pull threads out of these (their favorite trick with regular towels), then I would not want to ""PAY A FORTUNE"" for towels that were being ""TESTED.""Since the less expensive towels has passed their test with flying colors, I decided to get a slightly more expensive lot for the Master Bath, where I knew they would take a beating on a daily basis.So, I ordered these towels. I got two orders of three each.That number has worked beautifully for us. I got enough towels that we could mix and match colors. I must say that they definitely look upscale hanging in both bathrooms. If I was washing my hair, it used to take 2 regular sized ""Bath Towels"" to get that job done...one for the hair and one for the body. When I used my first Turkish Towel, I was amazed, ..one towel dried my hair, the body., and even got my backabsolutely dry.What a wonderful deal. The towels Dry me and then go through the washer and dryer and come out looking like new.(The kitties find this tight weaved towel to be of no fun!)  Even the tassels dry out straight. You do have to remember NOT to wash them with any sort of shedding fabric...like the old style towels have.) I imagine you would end up with tassels with fuzz all over them. I DID NOT try this combination to see what happened.So, I really love my new towels. I love the softness. I love the texture...the texture  that the cats have no interest in.  I love the nice, bright colors which one mix and match without the towels screaming out(We Do Not Go Together!)So now I have both bathrooms decked out in this type of towel and I am very happy with the results. So, I highlt recommend these to one and all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2URCP982XFZNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LWALRS6#wasThisHelpful","R2URCP982XFZNV","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"lIt is really difficult for me to find petite sizes that fit. I do not knoe that this is a direct result of my body being shaped so strangely that no vendor can find a way to acommodate. That is generallyn the spiel that they give me. However, if I just accept that the legs will be too long or that the sleeves will have to be rolled up, then a size 12 or a size 14 will fit ""as expected"" right across the board.It seems like vendors just really do not know what to do with a Petite. Theoretically, the size should stay the same, but the length of the sleeves in a blouse or top should be shorter and with pants or shorts the same thing should hold true. The body of the garment should stay the same, with the length of the legs being shorter in both pants or shorts.Coral Bay did an OK job. Their size 14P equals a 12 throughout the body of the garment with the length being what you would expect in a 14.So, eventually, I ordered a 14P in these shorts. The lenghth was good because I am 5' 5"". The overal size was good because I prefer a size 12. I COULD give the advice to go up one size;  however, this might really throw things off depending upon how tall you are and what size you normally wear.Frequently, I get so tired of this Petite size game that I just go to whole sizes: generally a 12 is good, but it seems like that in leggings, I take a 10. Like many people who order online, I have to TRY a couple of sizes before I find what I really need.Still, for me this is a better option than driving to the nearest mall, and trying on ""This size"" for one vendor and then ""That size"" with another. Of course, I put the face of the poor harassed sales lady in this equation. I would prefer to do the whole scenario in the privacy of my own home.Other than the fact that these run a bit small in a petite, I still do like them. The quality of the fabric is good and I have worn these at least once a week during the summer and on into the fall as this IS SUNNy ARIZONA.Overall, these are really niice, especially since there is a draw string in the waiste, therefore, it is adjustable.So, I do recommend thse with a bit of hesitation...you may have to order more than one size in order to get what fits you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31Z0TRE8C3X4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAOECMA#wasThisHelpful","R31Z0TRE8C3X4P","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am not entirely happy with this  purchase at all. I have other Zable beads with this pattern:  that is, they have a pink flower with greenery extending around the bead.  In stead, I received a blue bead with a white blob on it and red dots within the white blob. The white and the red in no way look like my other beads which have pink flowers on them. These were all to go on one bracelet I am putting together. The Red dots on the white circle in no way look like a flower!I have purchased many a Zable Bead. Generally on Amazon Zable Beads are vendored through Fine Jewelers. Only one other time have I had them send me the wrong bead. So I will send them an Email and inquire about the blue bead with the Pink Flower. Sometimes a Vendor will discontinue one bead and then sell a different bead under the same number.. If that is what happened, I will not be able to get the correct one, or the one I want. If someone just flubbed up and sent the wrong bead, then a replacement can be done.

Because the message is that someone loves him and cares abput what is going on with him...something that electronic messagews can never do.7. The birds on the postcards are beautiful, The Glitter highlightx the card  and accentuates its beauty, the heavy bond paper makes the recipient realize that this is not just a little postcard thrown in the mail to share a message.

It is a real thing that he can hold in his hand and treasure.9. I see that many of the reviewers and recipients have found these so beautiful that they have had them framed. This is a warm, human, comforting gesture. People can treasure these for years knowing that someone truly cares for them...a wonderful gesture!What A WONDERFUL Treasure we have found in these cards. Just a few lines of prose and off it goes to be a treasure for the one who receives it.  Yes, I am Computer Literate, But the Art of writing will be a thing that will truly cost our society if our prose no longer covers the pages of paper, but is rather sent as electronic blips that have no warmth for the human heart.These are beautiful Post Cards. Please purchase them and send them out to keep the Love that is Spread from one to another when we take up our pen to send love, which then becomes our weapon against the Mediocracy, Terror, and general Dishelvelment that is currently trying to rule our world.

"This is beautiful, beautiful music. It is absolutely Christian in its theme, with Salvation and Exhortation, and Renewal being the major themes. It is sing acapella (no musical accompanyment, and it is so uplifting, that I bought two CD's...one for my home and one for my car. I have sent a couple as gifts....to peop;e who weChristian Music.  As you probably knoe, it is really difficult to pick out music for others.  It was with hpe and a prayer that I sent the CD's to my friends, but both really liked the music.  I also have Gloryland and The Cherry Tree by this group and those two are also lovely.Obviously, I would heartily recommend this CD as well as Gloryland and The Cherry Tree.

"I got this as a Birthday Present for a friend of mine with a wonderful Wry sense of humor. He is out of town for the summer, so I sent this to him at his Summer Cottage. He goes into work three days a week, but for the other two days, he enjoys the cottage. His friends visit him and he likes to have Coffee Table Books around for his guests. Of course he has to read the book several times himself just to make certain it is OK for the guests.....that is a bit of a joke.He revels in The New Yorker Cartoons. I am not fooled.I waited a few days after his birthday and then gave him a call. Yes, ""He allowed""  He had received the book and it was ""Quite Goos"".  That, in his language, is akin to a ""Platinum Edition of a CD, or a Newberry Award for a Book. It is his Highest Praise.I know him well. Even though it is on the coffee table, he will take his coffee and sit their and read it again.I am so pleased my friend truly enyoyed this gift.So, for you out there with a wry sebse of humor, I anticipate that you may find this to be a Quite Pleasing compliment to your Library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H2SXE8Z0N74T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1576600807#wasThisHelpful","R3H2SXE8Z0N74T","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a beautiful accent bead from ARG' I actually bought this a year ago and have worn it on my bracelets in several different configurations.It has certainly stood the test of tiem. It is just as pretty now as it was when I got it. The silver has not worn or tarnished;  nor, have the flowers been damaged and I can guarantee you they have taken a beating on my wrist because I wear two or three bracelets at a time!THE oNLY pROBLEM  i HAD WITH THIS IS THAT WHEN i FIRST STARTED WEARING IT, THE LITTLE FLOWERS WOULD TURN AND PINCH MY SKIN. i GATHER THAT OVER TIME, THOSE EDGES WERE ROUNDED OUT BY TAPPING AGAINST MY SKIN. the feeling went away after a couple of wearings'I an very pleased with this vendor.

"I have been an aficianado of Dangling Beads since I became hooked on Murano Bracelets, beads and charms about 4 years ago.However, finding quality Dangles is a constant battle. I came upon this Asset Resourse Group (ARG). I had purchased three other dangles from them, but they are no longer available, and I had two of their beads, which were nice, but nothing terribly special.But this Dangle is A Beautiful and Wondrous find for those of us who like little dangly things on our bracelets.SIZE:  It is One inch plus 2 mm when measured from the top of the Bangle to the bottom of the Turtle. The Turtle itself, not incliding the tiny tail that sticks out is 5/8 inch. THE SIZE OF THE PERIDOT ITSELF is 3/8 inch in lenghth and 1/4 inch in width.The Peridot is lovely. It is held securely in place by six jewelers' prongs. Your Peridot will not suddenly fall out of your Dangle. It is not glued into place but is secured  just as any stone should be!IS IT DOUBLE SIDED: No it is not The top of the Turtle has the Peridot. That Peridot represents the top portion of the Turtle's shell. The rest of the shell is painted green using enamel. There are 4 little legs and a tail that stick out. They are silver.The head of the turtle is where the dangle hooks onto the ""Dangling oirtionof this.THE UNDERBELLY IS ENAMELED A WHITISH YELLOW WITH THE PORTIONS REPRESENTING A SHELL BEING BORDERED IN SILVER.Well, that is that. It is a great find for a Dangle Lover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17ASNMM4EZPS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DMW73S#wasThisHelpful","R17ASNMM4EZPS9","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely bead . I had a LoveLinks (28 dollar bead) on my bracelet and ut cracked, then chipped. That vendor is no longer available through Amazon, and though I have always had excellent customer service with that vendor and their beads are still on the web, I decided to just replace the bead with a vendor available on Amazon. The cracked/chipped bead IS two years old.So, looked at a Bling bead which was yellow, but decided against it, I already have two of those on my yellow bracelet and they are beautiful, but the bead I needed to replace was more of a gold color.Then I found this Butterscotch bead by Asset Resource Group. It was more the color and price that I wanted to pay. Zable and Reflections Limited had beads that were pretty much identical to the one that broke, but Zable's beads are $29.95 and Reflections Ltd. go upward from about $32 and freqently have $5 to $8 dollars shipping added...UGHThis bead is approximately 5/8 inch wide. That includes the silver beveling.The coloreed portion of the bead is almost 1/2 inch wide. Witt the bead lying flat on my desk, the bead is eactly 1/2 inch wide.It is not quite as big as the bead that it is replacing, but that is OK. I could go to LoveLinks on the web and buy a duplicate, but the price is now $34.00. Crazy. All I would actually gain is 2 mm of with and one mm of height; therefore, I choose to take the more prudent path with this Lovely Butterscotch Bead.It is uniform in color and quality. At this price, it is the most beautiful yellow-gold bead I could have wished to find.I definitely recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V5PNEZ5YT4J2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DMUJ6U#wasThisHelpful","R3V5PNEZ5YT4J2","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are the neatest jeans I have seen in a long time. There are rhinestone decorations on the front which start right below the waistband and continuing to the bottom of the pocket. Then there is a semi-circle of rhines delineating the curve of the pe...obviously the same on both sides.To make these jeans even more interesting, there are a sprinkling of rhinestones on the backside.At first I hesitated to buy these because I immediately thought about the rhinestones coming off in the,  wash. So, I finally made a pact with myself...these will go to the drycleaner.The pants themselves are described as being the color of CLAY;  THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE AVERY VERY LIGHT TAN COLOR. So, They will show dirt and you will have to wear rhem carefully.There was only one thing I disliked about these, but it seems to be characteristic of NYDJ this year....the waistband comes just below my navel in the front. But in the back they are half way down my backside, which means I have to wear very much Bikini style panties, or they will show!So, I do recommend these jeans, but for me they will be for special occasions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UT4QT3AH53ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QBQFLHE#wasThisHelpful","R3UT4QT3AH53ZW","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful toilet Paper Holder. I bought it to replace the old fashioned one (with the two ends which go in the wall and the center part with a spring that you have to squish to get a roll of toilet paper on it.

"I happened upon the bracelet offered by this group in Stainless Steele. At the time I was actually looking for a cheap deal on a grouping of Blue Beads. It turns out that this Bracelet was a Terrific Find.IT IS THE MOST SENSIBLY DESIGNED BRACELET THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!I love to work with Murano Beads and have bracelets in many colors. Most of those are still on Sterling Silver Bracelets...which are a pain because they have to be polished. Even though I store the bracelets in anti-tarnish bags and the bags are in a jewelry box, they are exposed to regular air for the duration of the time that I wear them. And I may wear the same bracelets for a couple of weeks or even a month. I will put together a bracelet that I really like and then wear it to death. So, the Sterling Bracelet tarnishes, as do the silver centers of the beads I am wearing. I am not so careful of my beacelets that I take them off at night and put them away. Sorry. If I am working on the garden, then the bracelets work with me. If I am baking, then the bracelets help with the stirring. I have never had a bead fall apart because I was working. And, praise God, only once did I drop a glass bead and have it break. A Miracle.So I was thrilled when Stainless Steele bracelets first appeared. But they were like the Sterling ones when it came to putting on the beads...you had to unscrew one end of the bracelet, find a place to put the end you sceewed off, then put the end piece back on once all the beads and charms were on it. I actually have an entire section of an old fashioned ""Tupperware Organizer Box""...circa the 70's..filled with various ends of bracelets. Finding the correct end to a given bracelet is always an exciting process...do I have it, or did it jump in the floor and is now playing hide and seek with me? AND i LOST THE USE OF A $50.00 BRACELET BEcause the threads on the end of it were stripped.But this bracelet was designed by a person who knew Murano Bracelets! THERE IS no screw off end. Instead the end that generally screws off is attached to the bracelet. The connection area is actually small enough that you can thread the beads over the connector. Wonderful..no more loose ends to keep track of.In addition, this company sent me a free bead with my order of a bracelet. And it was no ugly bead that no one would ever want to wear;  instead, it was a nice one.  OK'''this is a really great vendor...They have made a Bracelet that stays intact and they include a free bead..what is not to like????I only have one small complaint, and this will cost them no stars as it is their preferred design and they can set the parameters any way they want to:  their longest bracelet is only 8 inches long and I prefer an 8.5 because it can hold more beads and still fit around my wrist.So, if you hate to polish silver and are tired of trying to keep up with the screw off ends to your bracelets, I suggest you try this one. I consider it to be quite a find!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MP55EKYJGBGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143TL75A#wasThisHelpful","R3MP55EKYJGBGN","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one beautiful belt!PROS:1. True to size: I wasn't sure what size belt to buy...so  I looked at the measurements given by Fossil and  tried to gauge the size of my waist. Other reviewers of other Fossil belts said ""measure, measure,  measure. Unfortunately my measuring tape has hidden from me and all I have to measure with is an  old fashioned measuring stick which measures up to 72"". So I took a piece of string and put it around my  waist, then cut it and held it up against the measuring stick to determine my waist size. It came to  38-40 inches so I went with a Large. In reality, I could have purchased a Medium. DO MEASURE.2.  If you measure with an accurate measuring device, Fossil's sizing information will give you an  accurate description of the size you need. If you are in between sizes, itis up to you...either get a  belt which is a bit too big (I am wearing my large on the third hole, or get the smaller size while  knowing that you may have to wear it on the last hole, or the second to last hole.3. The BELT is exactly one and a half inches wide. It easily goes through the loops on my jeans:  which are either NYDJ or Cold Water Creek (They are back, but doing Catalouge business only.  (I received my first Catalogue in about May or June 2015)'4.  The belt, in person, looks just as it does in its"" photo.  a.  The buckle is gold toned  b.  The belt itself is Black  c.  The entire length of the belt is embroidered, which you cannot see from the photo5.  The colors that are embroidered on the belt are Tan,, Turquoise, Olive Green, Orange-Red, and  White. The Predominant colors are Tan and White with the other colors available to make the  Belt a piece of Art instead of just a functional piece to hold your pants up!6. It is a truly beautiful belt7. I was able to purchase it on sale, but I would certainly be willing to pay afossil's rregular price which  currently seems to be about 38 dollars  (September, 2015).8. It does it's job and keeps my jeans at my waist rather than having them slide way way down so  that I look like a Granny who is a Punk Rocker Wanna Be!I can think of no cons.So I do recommend this belt.

"I got this beautiful ceramic mug as a Birthday Gift for my dearest friend.She always takes a coffee mug of some sort in the car with her as she speeds off to work.Once in a while, she will tell me of the failures her other mugs have been. She is certainly never one to complain, so I only find out about these failing mugs only in a roundabout way. While shooping together, I will see her eyeing some new appliance which will come with great ballyhooing about why This New Generation of mugs will keep your coffee hot or your Tea Cold much better than died after it went through the dishwasher, or was unusable because the lid cracked, or failed because it was too cold/hot outside and the thing only worked within certain proscribed temperature etc. etc.One time she gave me a cold drink with ice and announced that she hoped it worked for me OK. When I asked Why, she told me the following tale. This cup had to be kept in the freezer if it was to be used for cold drinks so the the substance in the middle of this cup could freeze and thus your drink would remain cold for an extended period.  BUT, since she uses it for hot coffee herself, she had had it in the freeaer for only 30 minutes prior to my arrival.  AND..she had noticed that the substance to keep things cold or hot, had dwindled awy with every handwashing, plus it had turned an ugly green color and quite frankly, she had found that her coffee did not stay all that warm, let alone hot, on her drive in to see her employer.So, basically, she had told me ""Good Luck with this Honey. Better drink it up before something else goes wrong with this contraption.""It was time she had something reliable to work with. While looking on Amazon for a travel cup that would keep things Hot, I found this travel mug by Lenox. But it was not the beauty of the mug that swayed me, nor was it that I could get a mug with my friend's initial on it, nor was it the 50% breakage warranty offered with this mug. In the end it was the reviews written on Lenox Ceramic Mugs written by HARD CORE Coffee Aficianados who described their pleasure regarding Lenox Travel Mugs of all types.I was amazed at some of the requirements that hard core coffee drinkers had for the mugs they chose. It had to bear up under Very Hot Coffee being plunged into on icy mornings where glove and coats and boots were the outfits of the morning. The cup could not crack and the lid, once applied, had to stay on through the thick and thin of the office commute. I found that the lid on the cup is like the gold dome on top of a snazzy building. If the lid failed in any way, the cup was tossed. There could be no separation of the lid and the cup; Cracking of a lid automatically disqualified the entire set up; and the most stringent of requirements were that the lid did no to drink coffee while negotiating a messy freeway; NOR,, in the strictest of requirements, could the lid be felt by the lower lip by the drinker who must only feels the ceramic on the lower mouth, never the silicone of the item capping their favorite morning wakeup call in the form of a liquid. THESE WERE SERIOUS PEOPLE WHO absolutely dotted theit i's and crossed their t's.I read many a revew od different types of cups, but those who chose Lenox Ceramic cups with Silicone lids had the very MOST STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS. They asked for perfection in items that I had not known existed..The Lenox Ceramic cup had to be the one For my friend. And, I was blessed to find that they even offered one with her initial on it!!!  Now, after all this reading about the perfection of this item, I had to get one for myself. I drink tea, not coffee and am quite used to my mouth hitting some sort of plastic lid handed out at the nearest take out window. I certainly did not have the list of requirements that THOSE COFFEE PEOPLE had.So, i found only one slight failing in  this ceramic beauty:  I wished that it had a larger capacity so I could have more tea with me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PBBR8U5J0IRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCWD64E#wasThisHelpful","R2PBBR8U5J0IRH","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This a beautiful, very classy ceramic cup for hot or cold liquids. I happened upon this while I was looking for a Lenox Spoon Rest for my stove. To be perfectly honest, I had never seen a ceramic mug like tnis and was enchanted when I did.I read some of the length reviews with great interest. Obviously there are those folks, I am guessing that they are Very Serious Coffee Drinkers who have listed all the reasons that these mugs are great and then there are some who had serious problems with these mugs...mostly that they cracked if a steeming, hot liquid was poured into them. Happily I have retired from the workaday word' therefore, I no longer need a cup of coffee attached IV style to my arm so that I am ready to Hit It at the approiate time.Since I l live in a desert climate, I am much more interested in staying hydrated than  being all revved up to work. This brings to my mind cold liquids rather than Hot Coffee. I read of no complaints about cold beverages, so I purchased this item with no trepidation. And so far I have had no problems at all. The container has kept my drinks cold through 3 hour get togethers with my friends; in my car when it is 113 degrees outside, my drink remains refreshing. It is accepted as a routine practice here that drinks are acceptable anywhere: shopping, at restaurants, meetings with friends, church qand even at weddings and funerals. So I take this whereever I go. I receive multitudes of compliments and several friends have gone to Amazon for one of their own.I do wish Lenox would sell the silicone lids separely as I fear the one I have will stretch out over time. amost people do not seem to see this as a problem so I will wait to see if the feared occurence occurs.I do recommend this and will probably order another after I finishChristmas gifts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R360ZW9MSJYG2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJ8DOXC#wasThisHelpful","R360ZW9MSJYG2K","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love using these color coordinated bags in my home. SOMETIMES i use the bags to coordinate with decorating colors that I have used and sometimes i use a specific color for other reasons.For instance, ai use the red ones in the front bathroom because the Shower curtain and many of the accesories have red in them.The kitchen gets blue because it is a lovely color and I spend a lot of time in the kitchen.The master bath gets purple.By using various colors in different rooms, ai can keep track of whether or not I have gotten all the garbage and gotten it to the barrel on trash night. Many a time ai will think that ai have everything, but then will realize that a color is missing...most frequent the stuff from the guest bathroom. So I think<<WHOOPS, you have forgotten the red trash. Since I have two trash cans in the master bath, I have to double check to see that ai have TWO of the purples.For me, these are not just a pretty product, but one that works on my organizational skills.It helps that these are well made. I have never had one leak, and they are just the right size for the small trash cans one has around the house..

"This is a nice dustpan and brush set. I bought this because the review applauded the brush and said it was wonderful. Because the brush was fairly expensive, I thought the dustpan would be metal;  however, it is plastic. I should have read the reviews and the item description more carefully. In addition, the manufacturer ran out of stock once the order had gone in and I had to wait almost a month for the things to get here. Meamwhilea, ai had ordered an Oxo Goodgrips set which arrived in two days and was busy cleaning up kitty litter spills with it when this arrived.I am giving it only four stars because the dustpan is plastic and because I had to wait so long for it to arrive.The brush does get up more dirt than cheaper brushes, but the plastic pan is average run of the mill pan. The plastic is fairly flimsey and I imagine the brush will be around long after the pan is gone. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaIi would recommend that you look for a better set...one with a metal dustpan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25XPQQUWFYIS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4WNG54#wasThisHelpful","R25XPQQUWFYIS0","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These jeans run a bit small. I recently lost 15 pounds. ai was wearing my old Sherri Jeans which are a14 P, but after wearing them for a whole day, they were embarrasingly baggy in the crotch and the posterior hung in wrinkles. Plus they were way way too long. I had to wear them double cuffed or they dragged on the ground.So when I ordered these I ordered a 12P. I had some 12 P's of NYDJ that were hanging in the closet that had been too small. Now they fit perfectly. So my order for these Clarrisa Jeans went in as a 12PWhat a disaster that was. They did button and if I were a cute little teenager, I may have kept them, but I have progressed to the point that ""I can no longer die young."" So I sent them back and got 14P What a difference a size makes. The 14P's fit perfectly and did not stretch out as much as my older ones. They hit me about an inch below the belly button, fit nicely through the hips and the legs hit me right above the ankles.I am 5' 3-4"" and weigh 160...a hefty gal I know. I claim it is all in my heavy bones!The fabric is beautiful. I have never seen fabric that is softly striated as these are. If you look carefully at the fabric you will see that the striations are caused by different weaving patters in the cloth. It is really pretty and I believe that it most prominent in these and the blue colored pants.I did order one size 12...it was only available in the grey. I think that I am just between sizes and that is a nuisance. But get these while you can.They are beautiful!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WL9XKVKCYDQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PKLUB6M#wasThisHelpful","R1WL9XKVKCYDQ0","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have found a new use for alcohol. MAny of us suffer from dry cracked heels and feet. One night I was at my wits end with this and my feet were aching so I just grabbed this bottle of alcohol that was nearby. I frequently use it for cleaning my tile floors.I sprayed this alcohol on my feet and immediately they were soothed. Then I noticed, that as I rubbed my feet, old skin was coming off. Overgrowths that I thought were permanent that were on the ends of my toes began to disappear. I spent 30 minutes working on my feet: alternately spraying on alcohol, then rubbing with a washcloth. When I finally finished, my feet looked like a newborns. There was no extra skin, no cracked areas, and no more flakes.I knew that alcohol was very drying, so I immediately slathered my feet with Burt's Bees Coconut lotion for feet. My ""new feet"" sucked this right up and since then I routinely clean my feet with this alcohol then moisturise them. ai also slleep with little booties on that keep my feet moist overnight.It has been a dream come true.

"I bought this sterling Silver clasp in two colors, red and blue, because I got really tired of my1. LEATHER BRACELETS: pulling apart because the ends which hold the clasp in place  are just crimped together and once the weight  of beads and charms becomes TOO MUCH the little crimped portions pull apart...and there I was at the Museum downtown with charms and  beads flying in all directions2.  STERLING SILVER BRACELETS: Sterling bracelets usually have some sort of a screw on device on them so that you unscrew an end, then  put your beads and charms on then screw the end back in place. If you change your bracelet frequently....put on new/different beads or  charms.....then, usually sooner than later, the little screw on ends, or the receptacle into which the screw goes will be ""stripped."" Once any  portion of the threads are stripped, the bracelet is shot. We are talking about a tiny interface in this instance...with the end which are to be  screwed together being about 1/16 inch in size.  Before, I realized how much pressure was being put on a tiny threaded area on my bracelets, my beads went flying 1. in a friend's car2.  right outside the door before Bible Study 3. An untold number of times at my dining room table while I was changing beads and charmsaround 4. while I was working on the computer ( then the flying beads become a special ""hunt item"" for the cat) and most miserably 5. Inevitably a friend would drop by and want a bracelet, so I would give her an old bracelet to practice with ie.  a. Put beads and charms on thisuntil you get a combination you like 2. Put it on your wrist to be sure it still fits once the beads and charms are in place.  Of course, the first time a friend waggles an arm, having stated that end clasps take up too much room, beads go flying. Enter the cat to hunt lost beads...she really is quite good at this.3.  STAINLESS STEELE BRACELETS: also suffer with the same problem as the Sterling bracelets..a tiny bit of stainless with screw threads is holding your bracelet together; however, stainless does not strip its threads nearly as easily as Sterling. I have only had a Stainless bracelet fail one time...and it was my fault for not assembling the bracelet more carefully.So back to the subject at hand:  Once you have a clasp on either end of your bracelet, things should not go flying. But, you have to be sure to place these on the bracelet in an area BEFORE THE SCREW AREAS. iF YOU PLACE this over the area that screws and unscrews, then if the threads pull apart, your beads will go flying again.I put two of these on one of my favorite bracelets...one at the end where the first beads went on and at the end before the screw area was reached. I have had that bracelet, a blue one,These are very high quality and keep things where they should be.There are a couple of things I am not crazy about with these:1. I think this is quite a bit overpriced....others are available at much lower prices which do just as dandy a job2. These tarnish badly..I keep mine in an anti=tarnish bag and include a strip of anti tarnish paper, but they still tarnishOtherwise they are quite lovely and I do recommend them","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP8A4HD31XT7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042ZAGSK#wasThisHelpful","RP8A4HD31XT7K","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a bout of illness that left me feeling washed out and generally out of place in my own home. I was cruising through Lenox to find a gift or  two for those who had helped me so much. I happened across this as I was looking and it was like being hit by a ray of sunshine. I ordered one with the intention of giving it to one of my neighbors. When It arrived, I opened it to make certain it was all in one piece and was as lovely as it looked in Amazon's picture.It was more beautiful than the picture. For starters it is bigger> I thought it might be 4 inches by 4 inches, but it is closer to 6 x 6. I had been looking for a spoon rest to use when I was cooking, but had not found one that suited me. When I saw this I realized it would double as a lovely saying and a spoon rest that would hold 2 or 3 cooking implements all at the same time.Too bad for the neighbor, I got this and its beauty really perked me up.  The neighbor got  a ceramic coffee mug from Lenox.

"I bought three sets of socks from Javel, one in the color shown above and two more in other colors. I did not wash them before I wore them. They were so pretty and I was in such desperate need of socks, that I went ahead and wore them, then laundered them.I was in for a very unpleasant surprise. Fifty % (50%) and I did count very carefully, of these socks came out of the washer/dryer process (one time only) and were then unwearable. The greatest offender is a seam which connects the top part of the sock to the bottom and this seam simply unravels in the wash/dry process.I was going to a movie with a friend and had on a yellow outfit, so I grabbed the yellow socks to wear. I noticed a small hole right above the ankle, but it looked very small and I thought I might get by with it. I tried to put the sock on but ended up with a top and a bottom in my hand. Perhaps pink would not be too bad with yellow. The pink sock unravelled also. I ended up wearing orange socks and looked just like your average Bag Lady.  At least it was dark in the movie theater, so hopefully not too many people were giggling as I courageously walked by.I have now had these too long to return them., But believe me, I will not buy anymore from this vendor.

"I am going to give this paper for writing a 5 Star review. As other reviewers stated, the paper is high quality bond. I generally use a medium felt tipped pen in my correspondence since, as I grow unerringly older, my handwriting deteriorates. When I use w medium felt tip pen on high quality bond, my somewhat jittery writing levels out and my writing becomes legible once more.  That is especially nice for the person receiving my correspondence...then they stand a chance of reading what has been pennedMy only unhappiness with this product (and it is my fault for not having read preceding reviews more carefully) is that the background color is a light tan. One reviewer stated that it was rather a cream color. To me, it is a light tan.However, though I was remiss in not reading enough reviews in order to determine the exact color of this paper, I DID read every thing the vendor had to say about this and several other colors of paper that were available. It seems that Peter Pauper Press is excellent at telling us the color and nature of the decorations found on the paper, they are quite remiss at giving us the background color. I ordered my box with the intention of using the pieces to go along with a set from another company, I had used too many stationery sheets from that set, and had many envelopes remaining. Since I thought these were pink, J thought I had solved problem.  Oh well, if I use a pink envelope with a cream/tan paper, who shall be the wiser? I generally open the envelope of correspondence that I receive without giving it a second glance. What I want to get to is the letter and what it has to say.Since I have to believe there is no ""You must use matching envelopes and stationery FAIRY"" hanging around to bring me woe, I shall just work with what I have and go on about my business.

"Several of the reviewers said that this was a a very nice cross. I had been looking for a really nice one to put in my guest bedroom, so I gave this one a try. It arrived within two days, but when I opened it I was really disappointed. Like many other items that are made f some type of colored, molded plastic, this one looks to be exactly what it is: An item made of molded plastic with the plastic being colored by a process not discussed. Like several other items that I have looked at made by this process or one similar to it, this one has a tawry, cheap look to pt. I set the cross far away fro me (I had planned to hang it over the closet doors, near the ceiling in the spare room...so I was trying to figure out if it did not look so cheap if it was viewed from a distance) and tried to decide if it looked OK if I were not so close to it.Distance did help. But there remained the problem of reading the words on the cross.  One has to get pretty close to the cross, within just a few feet, in order to read the words. One loses the judgement of this being a nice looking piece if one is close enough to read the words.  This also made the ""over the closet doors"" a problematic position for this piece.  If it is far enough away that it does not look so cheap, then it may be too far away for a guest to be able to read the words.  Now There Is A Predicament!Unfortunately, as I thought  I had found just the perfect sentiment with which to soothe a weary visitor, I am going to have to send this back. Right now I have a cross above said doors which is just a plain little cross.. Perhaps it says exactly what needs to be said...nothing more than its mere presence....then each guest can fill in any empty blanks in prayer without the nuisance of added verbiage.I am not crazy about this cross, though I find it's sentiment to be beautiful and strangely haunting.

"Though I am not Jewish, I know what a Mezuzah is. Since God grafted the Gentiles into His Original Vine, which would be The Jewish Nation, I do not think He would mind if I borrowed a tradition which belonged to them. I, too, want my home to be given His protection and blessing. I was browsing around one day looking for a cross that I could put on a barren area of my wall. While doing so, I happened upon this lovely Brass MEZUZAH written in nice clear English, rather than the traditional Hebrew.  What a find.PROS;1.  The Mezuzah is Solid Brass; therefore it will not rust.2. It is a nice size for putting on your doorpost: ACTUAL MEASUReMENTS:  a.  The LENGTH: Including the projections through which the screws will go is 5 1/2 inches  b.  The BODY of the item without the scerw hole areas is 4 1/2 inches  c.  The width is 1 1/2 in ches  d.  The depth, including the rounded area on the body of the Mezuzah is 3/8 of an inch  3. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPER PLACEMENT are included  a.  SLANT the Mezuzah with the top inclined toward the door  b.  SLANT the bottom toward the outside of the door  c.  PLACE this on the upper third of the doorpost at eye level...if you are VERY SHORT or VERY TALL, you may want to place this at the  eyeball level of a more average sized person....I see the Jews touch this item before they enter a home so they are covered with God  blessing while they are in a home which is not their own. Since I rarely enter my own home through the front door, I tend to consider this  more of a blessing for my guests, though I consider it a continual Blessing/Safety Net for myself and those who live with me.  d.  Once you have decided upon the placement of the Mezuzah on your doorpost, attach it with two screws...they are not included  e. FINALLY, you are to recite the following blessing over your new Mezuzah:  Blessed Are You Oh Lord Our God, Ruler of the Universe,  Who has Sanctified Us by Your Commandments and has Commanded Us to Affix The Mezuzah.  f. In  Hebrew, the word Mezuzah, means DOORPOST.  CONS:  1. No SCREWS are provided for the attachment of The Mezuzah.  2. Since this is Brass...NOT BRIGHT BRASS, but with some antiquing on it, I would like to put it up with similar screws, but I do not have any  this color, I will have to go to the hardware store to get a couple, but I do not know if I can buy just two. In today's world, I may have to  get a whole pak. I guess that is OK because screws are not something that show once they are in place.This item is sold by Holy Land Gifts. Their Phone Number is 1-800-564-4659.I do recommend this item, even with no screws. It is really pretty and the instructions for placement are quite clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A0KCWE3V1VNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6BUZ2Y#wasThisHelpful","R3A0KCWE3V1VNB","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was lucky enough to try to lose some weight and stuck with it and did so. Hoorah. In the process I went from a bra size 42 D to a 38 C. I know that many of us do not go around whooping for joy when our boobs become smaller, but in this case I did. I was sick and tired of searching and searching for a pretty or even decent looking bra when I was a 42 D. I found that I could fit into nursing bras (God Forbid...I am not 25 any more), or I could have my choice of very practical WIDE STRAPPED bras...UGH NO! So, when I became a bit smaller, pretty bras actually fit into my realm again.I was very blessed to have Amazon initiate its annual Labor DaY Sale at that point, and this time I was happy to scan the offerings that Amazon put forth. I purchased this Simone Perele Andora bra in Poppy Red.  The white and beige and lighter colored bras tend to still run at higher prices, but Poppy Red was available at a totally reasonable cost. (For some reason the computer seems to think I purchased this in Ivory, but, not so..a bright Poppy Red is what I am currently wearing.Without a doubt, it is the most beautiful bra I have ever owned. I went back to peruse other colors this afternoon, but they are all hanging in at about $89.00 and I am just too Scotch to part with that kind of money for a bra.  Although, who knows, in the future, I may decide it is worth it.I was lounging around in my grungies, reading a book today and a friend called and invited me to go to a meeting at church with her. Well, the book was a 500 page tome and I would much rather be with my friend, so I showered and then went looking for my Poppy Red bra. The meeting was at one oclock. It is now 7:00 PM. If I were not writing a review on this bra, I would not even be aware that I had it on. It is that comfortable.The straps adjust from the back, which I like better than the front adjustiing ones. They stay in place and do not go wandering off my shoulders in search of my waist. I have been known to get the straps adjusted just where I want them and then stitch then in place to washing does not disrupt their placement, nor does extended  wearing or anything else that gives them an excuse to jump off my shoulders.When and if, this bra goes on sale, I will get another color.

"I read the reviews on this particular cross and found that some were good and some were bad. In those instances, I have discovered that it is generally a gamble to order such an item as it is a stroke of fate to see what you will receive:  some are good and some are bad, so I take my chances and go for it!This time I was on the unlucky side of the coin toss. The leather on my cross is a dark dark brown and I was anticipating a medium brown that then darkened toward the edges. Not so for me. The leather is just dark all over. Additionally, it is starting to curl like the reviewer who posted pictures shows.I looked at many crosses before I picked one. I needed a fairly large cross and this one fits the bill in that area. I also did not want turqioise or any other stone in the middle of the metal one.  So I hoped this plain metal one would be attractive, but since the leather is so dark, the silver color metal goes poorly with it and the black cross under the silver metal one is just lost in a sea of dark leather. I had to look really hard to even find it. It provides no contrast at all.So, I find this cross to be poorly made and it certainly did not fit the bill for me. You may get a decently made one or you may get one that is not so good as I did. Mine is going back. I would not waste my own time again and do not recommend this item.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9GAZYIVYM5OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OFV2620#wasThisHelpful","R9GAZYIVYM5OO","A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The reason I think I really enjoyed this book is the characters themselves. The way the author has set them up then went from there gave it full body. Chloe makes a statement that many a woman has made but when they meet the right man it can turn that around. Ryan wants a night of just being himself away from the ice but then he runs into Chloe. They hook up and once it is in slowly sinks further and further. I could just picture her face too when she finds out that he is a well known hockey player when the kids from a charity she is with, are on the ice with the players. The way the author takes them off from there is like a speeding bullet kinda with a little harmless blackmail too. The two of them meld so well together and when they do come together they could melt the ice he skates on. He is with someone who is for real and she is with someone that keeps the game on the ice. She will find herself doing things she probably swore off more and more. The chemistry is such that the personalities is what I latched onto, added humor between the two was a plus too. But with all well known people sooner or later the press will paint them black and that is where drama will start and emotional side will be tested to the limit. I love how she ends it that with a sweet touch added that wraps it up nicely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGQANKC33UEZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CLZ5RE#wasThisHelpful","RGQANKC33UEZS","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Alix might be the girl he remembers but the girl that comes is there thanks to seeing something that has her running away from her ordered life for a minute. I for one am glad she goes to the ranch, and this author takes you along with them as he melts away the hurt by showing her what a real man is all about that can love. Nothing better than seeing a woman also grab life with two hands going for the real romance. As he brings her to life for the first time you enjoy every step of their journey.

"First off I must say after having read many of her novels I think this one will be one of my favorites. I say this because it will show how in order to overcome fear patience fueled by love is the key to it when it comes to a relationship. It starts a healing process and opens up the gates to allow feelings such as happiness to have a chance to once again be experienced where once it was all closed off. By now many have found their mates around him with his mind wondering if he too could have that chance. Little did he know that when he went to give his estimate to one lady who had quite the reputation with even the word Ice being used, that his was right before him until he touched her. Jared did not know that Taryn did not touch anyone for she had a fear since she had the gift of pyrokinesis. I do not think even if he knew it would of stopped him anyways. This author gives you their story with humor mixed in with raw emotion. Another discovery will be her son and how special he too is. There will be many discoveries in this one with old enemies coming to the surface as well. It would also seem that how and why she did end up here in the first place will be uncovered with not just one needing the information. Jared will show her how love can be patient and strong to overcome many things. He will unlock her in ways she never thought to live again. She will also be his missing piece because he too has a secret that even the pack is not aware of. Danger too will have to be met and faced with her no longer being alone in the battle.

Bethany with her grandmother are from the property next to his that the rental cabins stand on. This author lays the foundation on their story with you following and latching on to these two and their feisty personalities. A perfect match for Jack I think. Be ready to be transported along with this high drama filled suspenseful romance that as Jack and his team go after a killer he also begins to get wrapped around Bethany. She is taking care of her grandmother while running the business does at times have her hands full because of her grandmother's Alzheimer's. They begin to fit in with each other and what is going on their relationship building. The intensity and at times raw passion that quickly forms into a love that is deep I would say for both. Danger though also has it's sights on her and when it reaches out and grabs hold you might find yourself gritting your teeth so hard to chew nails especially at the climax. Suffice to say the level of suspense is superb with the right amount of romance to feed any reader's addiction. Her ability to take you and embroil you in, but also keep you locked in it through it all capping it off with gently rolling you out, happily exhausted but satisfied at the end is what a reader craves from any novel they enter in and she delivers it with this. Her novels have become done with a style of high caliber that you look forward to each one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJ8Z0V8E0E1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GGWGNE#wasThisHelpful","R1CJ8Z0V8E0E1P","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So wonderful this author has taken me on another journey with none other than a dragon that can come heat my bed for the winter. Seriously though she has taken this dragon and personalized his quest that will include not one but two beautiful ladies. By the time you are finished with their story you are yet again reminded why dragons are a favorite and a love of many. Kara is one resourceful cat and she had to be, but having been gone longer than she wanted at all because it was not by choice, Cayden is not going to let her close to Nyna. Nyna is his even though she is human she has through alot. Someone has killed her parents but the case is still open and now cold. He is also cursed and only true love can break it. He wants to start the dragon's web if she will have him but he will soon find out Kara is also part of her life too. So much to keep a reader embroiled in a suspenseful hot story that you too will find yourself being part of the dragon's web. You get their story and the answers to her parents murder thanks to curiosity that opened that up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ETZETZJGWG7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OSQ47E#wasThisHelpful","R3ETZETZJGWG7H","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every once in awhile you look for something different because too much of same thing gets blah but not with this author. She has story lines and characters that are different especially since subject matter is not over done. Faith is doing what she dreamed and loves her dogs and takes to building trust with abused and unwanted dogs by fostering them. Plus she knows how it is to be abandoned. Then there is Tanner who came close to death's door but given a second chance he ends up helping a town's shelter. When they meet at the shelter that is a new door that opens for the both of them. Funny too is the trust factor on both of them is same and check up on each other. Faith though begins to notice something strange at the shelter and curiosity will lead her into danger a time or two. Of course Tanner no dummy he too notices some things and the two of them together uncover some stuff that would get anyone's blood boiling. Of course do not forget the romance it is in here, sweet and sneaky that catches these two that are perfect for each other. With the hair curling ending event this author will wrap up their romance in perfect way-fur and all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OEOHA8XVJVCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PKYSA4#wasThisHelpful","R2OEOHA8XVJVCM","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that when I open one of her novels I am going to get transported into different that is a style all her own. She captivates right from the start giving you characters that you learn about and then fall in love with going with them through their story. While I was reading this one I really sympathized with Ned and wanted something, anything for him thanks to those Wizards. In this one you go on a grand adventure with him. She will also have many other characters in here that will support the story perfectly to a tee. There will come a point when he will have to choose though especially because of Amanda. The funny thing though thanks to this author I would be so caught up in this story that I would zone out everything around. Of course as with anything there is dark and light but the ways of it seem real enough in here. Fighting and armies are also part of it but not like you think the magical kind. She does not forget the romance either it does come alive in here with in my opinion love being the victor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3901011FRPROE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017A6Y660#wasThisHelpful","R3901011FRPROE","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time in reading this author for me and even though I see alot that it says she is erotic author, I like she has a story to go with it. This is also alittle different than most because it has a flavor of paranormal, biker, mixed with that. One thing I do know is that this one was a raw, passionate mixed with drama paranormal. Her characters I came to adore, first with the boldness of Tabitha whom finally sees him too-Finn. When she announces to the club's alpha and president that she knows they know what she is and she wants to be their type of wolf, oh boy she will get a whole different reality than what she thought. When Finn realizes just exactly what more there is to Tabitha he does what he must. The only thing I disagreed with where he was concerned he should of been more up front with her at times. Rich story with a couple of unexpected events with when you reach the end you might find yourself whining like I did that it was not longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPRRLHKUX3K70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01740N6NQ#wasThisHelpful","RPRRLHKUX3K70","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do have to say first off that I think I liked this one better than the first one because you know more about what is going on. That Daire also thinks he is all that and he certainly is but he will meet more than his match. Cee Cee might be something he is looking for but she will give him something unexpected that will set the wheels turning in a chase that will be the beginning of their forever. Gleefully you will see her take him down and start her plans that will have him chasing her, good thing for her but will be the first of many turbulent adventures in fulfilling her plans. Humor also when her kids find out their mom is doing some crazy things and with Daire of all people whom they blame haha. It also will be the start in shutting down some serious places that is harmful to alot of people but also a set up is in the works that comes to light. Another thing that comes to light is exactly who Cee Cee is and just how special she is. I like that when they come together they both get something special that neither was looking for or expecting. Needless to say this author has done it again a provided another fabulous read that even though it is wicked it is also delicious.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30DLEHRPUS1FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URQETIG#wasThisHelpful","R30DLEHRPUS1FH","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It did not matter to me that I did not read the first one because of the star line up of authors that it contained. If I can not read paranormal, I crave novels such as these and to have this many back to back I was in lala land. What captured me right away is the precept that they were ghosts and I do not mean the Gothic kind either. They were that way for a reason but each author gives their comeback a stunning return in a way that fits them and the reasons for it. Not to say the danger is over either for them but love will drive many. Not all are male either we are also given a mighty strong female that will blow most away. The relationships are intense with each author giving it their special brand to their story. Through the dark pieces there is the light that will heat up each one. I actually thought by the time I would be done I might have a slight case of OD but I was quite sadden when I reached the last one and finished it especially since it had me on a roll most times. These are the finest given you their finest with love that now will grab them to the point of meltdown.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJBL697TDX4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016EHG6KA#wasThisHelpful","R3NJBL697TDX4C","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do so enjoy reading military romance. This author knows how to write them right. this one will also pull at your heart strings and keep you transfixed as this story develops as you read it. Ryan had known he was going to marry Elana but before he asked her he had enlisted. I know personally that has caused a rift or two in a relationship but that being said it does go with who you are with if that is their heart's desire. Elana does say yes but then you see the struggle she has and the wear and tear it puts on their relationship once he is in training. Oh my then it gets really emotional but love will have to work overtime. The thing about love it will overcome many mountains as this author will show. She will tell you what Elana does with her decisions, time will tell how it all works out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R340CUK2EDMCUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017SAAGAS#wasThisHelpful","R340CUK2EDMCUP","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Funny how some think they can match people up and are very good at it. She is also very talented but Chole also gets excellent results. When one alpha who must do what he must do even when he does not want to goes to her for a mate but how can she find him one if he doesn't believe in love? Oh just love those stories when one or the other does not believe in love because it will prove them wrong every time. When she becomes his temporary one they both I do believe signed up for one wild and crazy time courtesy of love. As this little war plays out this author will give you sizzle and burn with it so be careful of the sparks that will fly out. I also love when a alpha will meet his match per say. Kieran will also have a bit of a war between his wolf and self as he fights love. Of course Chole packs quite a punch because of who she is and even when a bit of a challenge for his affections comes along I say the other one lost before she started. Funny how saying I Love You can put fear into even the strongest. This author gives you one that shows you no matter how you try and think you can, you can not fight love. There will be a winner in this and glad I witnessed it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GENFVP0OADQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MP6I1M#wasThisHelpful","R2GENFVP0OADQ3","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not get to read as many as I would like novels set back in time, but when I do they must be full of adventure. This one was more than I asked for. To my special delight one of the pirates is a woman whom is full of adventure and daring, very much the Captain of her ship. This author pulls no punches in how she starts this out full of a fight going after a treasure. Catherine does know how to fight and she does not sit back either. Thomas does not give up without a fight even when he realizes that his opponent is whom it is. This author though will give you their adventure that will keep you fixed to their story. She has her reasons and even as their relationship grows the fire from them both, their sparring will thrill you,plus it will be the best romance in quite awhile. There will be some surprises at some turns but never a dull moment. She will get far more than what she set out to get even though she does not think so until this author gives you a ending that will put them on another adventure of a different kind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E1VDQBIYW4IE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CLB7CG#wasThisHelpful","R2E1VDQBIYW4IE","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Read the first one in this series and loved it so just had to open this one. This author knows how to weave you in with the magic of her writing. Serenity is the one here who has alot to face even with her abilities. Then there is Alexi whom you will eat right up. Plus they have met before. He works for a different area and he has been watching her quite awhile now. They both have things that are special about them and together they will explode. Your heart will race for them especially when he thinks he can not have forever. Threats must be stopped and that too will keep you on the edge of your seat or where ever you read from. I do so love when a author though can take and put love in charge because it can go against all odds and overcome mountains, foes or rules. High level of action for those that crave it with your romance. But through it all she will give you what you crave and want with this one especially since love sees the inside and she will give you a ending for them that will etch a satisfied smile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYAX80OMBB5VU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CLB636#wasThisHelpful","RYAX80OMBB5VU","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy reading this series from this author. Each one gets into your heart and grabs ahold. This one was exceptional a heart wrencher because of the basis. You adopt but then someone shows up needing to know if that child is theirs because they did not know and things could drastically change in the blink of a eye. Alex has several challenges, she is about to loose the dream of owning the bakery and Hayden pops in with the news he needs a DNA test to see if maybe her daughter is his. Well written and a flow that once you are on it you do not want to get off because of the emotions that swirl with having to know the answer yourself. You also see that a relationship is building and with the romantic at heart I have I so want it all to work out for them because of what is written of her past, she deserves the best. She will play on many of your emotions but best of all is the characters in this series and as she focus is on one of the girls in each one you really fall in love with them. I will say I was surprised with the results and loved how it was written unexpected endings are the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12HWT6QVYII0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PC4BR6#wasThisHelpful","R12HWT6QVYII0F","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You first are given her heart stopping nervousness everytime she sees him which leads to daydreams on her part. Mary Alice is relate able because women that hide behind walls after too many hurts seem to look but can not seem to touch. Bridge though kinda set her up I would say purposely using that eye candy build to make her sweat. He has to get her on his side for a undercover that has to do with her neighbor. Undercover and stuff like that makes for suspenseful reading but she has added in a hard to crack wall thanks to her past that cops no way is that her cup of tea. This will catch your interest, have you so caught up in their relationship that when the drama hits the fan you almost forgot why they met in the first place.

"This is a nice romance that is set in the south and so enjoy reading about B&B's. Savannah is home after her mother's death to meet her brother and sister and see about the B&B left by her. Thing is she did not plan on coming back and the memories are alot. Logan also has many of his own but he is also here for his company he works for to buy the place that has become the one of the town's landmark, but also thinks he can not have the girl. Their story is like a second chance but they have both hid their feelings from each other but others did see it in the past. The past will in way meet the present with things coming out in the open. Some parts though are kinda long that could of been quicker but when they interact with each other they have a special blend together with bits of humor mixed in even when she is steaming mad at him. Time will also be short if they are to save the place because of past money owed which gives it some suspenseful moments.

"I was glad to find the time to read this next one in this series that is breeze to read thru. This one is also more focused filled with a touch more suspense type thriller. Maile like the other women was on of the ones that chatted in the group on line and met with them to then settle in Seattle to start their own business. It seems though that while the other three are on cases she is not quite there yet but when she does she gets a whooper. Also being alittle homesick she is in search of food from her home here that really is the taste of home and finds it. Kalama is as intrigued by her as she is of him. Her case though will touch of possible murder with him being one of the suspects later. She reels us readers in and takes us on a nice little adventure that could turn deadly if not careful which is the kind of reading I so enjoy. It having that touch of romance in there makes for a bonus all the way around.

"I just love this series and when this author has another one to offer in it I can hardly contain myself. She knows how to make this come alive and the characters melt in your mouth. Jazz is a bodyguard and she is given a special summons so special how could she refuse. Her charge is one of the seven and also key to saving the day thanks to being the scientist he is. Now to find Rockwell Burns will be another thing which she is part of her specialty. She also needs to work out and finds the perfect place with Conner hiring her to boot. Little does she know but senses that her charge is right under her nose. There is also a attraction between these two and when they do connect it is enough to melt the mat. Anyways she will reel you in with this one because who doesn't love a sexy genius but the two of them together is some exhilarating reading within itself. There is also others that want to find Rockwell for their own reasons,so when the majority of the seven get together to plan it will come together with more electricity to keep you charged. Jazz and Rockwell make a good team they fit so well together with this being another piece to this series that keeps you panting for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38T8GPU58EN8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016JVQA6G#wasThisHelpful","R38T8GPU58EN8Y","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes i am reading so many books I forget until thankfully a author sends a reminder of a release of something I said I wanted to read and smack my head oh yeah. So when I relooked at this blurb I thought now not too sure forgot time travel in it and do not read too many of those any more but hey grew up in the seventies so okay. I am introduced to Desi and she is at the end of her rope per say thanks to a accident but she happens into a what is a psychic's place and she is told some pretty wild stuff. She follows it to Bernie's museum home, he was a R&B superstar after all, and wow she is there in his time. Thing is though a month later in a car accident their lives end. So this author gets you back to that time also but you are on pins and needles even during their wonderful building relationship. You get so far hooked into them that you are desperate for something, anything to change. This author will deliver one emotional story that will capture you taking you back and forth. Even when you get what you want she still will be dancing on your heart strings because of poor Bernie. She does know how to bring it all around to the point that with love being the bridge you get full circle and ya it sure was ""deeper than perfect"". Gotta love when a title aptly fits the book. So now I am more than glad I read this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NNJRSO2JLN1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016H7W426#wasThisHelpful","R1NNJRSO2JLN1A","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even though they are the main-Jack and Leila, you also get filled in and more of the others also. It does not mean she does not pull your heart strings though because I do believe some parts blew it up. The little girl for one. Even Matt will put his wonderlust to bed hehe. Alot of authors could take a page from her because we do want a novel like this when we have really connected with characters.

"I have read this author before but this one for the most part kept me on the edge of my seat because of anticipation. Andi goes to take a trip to scatter her mother's ashes but ends up in trouble;e when mud and rocks come down and also avoids a bear. When she is later rescued by said bear he also bits her which opens the door to a different road for them both. She later wakes to find she is with the ranger Mac and they must wait at his cabin until help can come for her. During that time you find out all about Mac and also the consequences of that bite. You also realize they are perfect for each other but because of his heart he wants it to be her choice. You just know everything would be ok between them just love her already and do not let her leave. Even though things are changing inside for her she does not have a clue. She just knows that after she has gone he has filled her thoughts and heart and she must see him again soon. From there you are really hollering come on already but this author tortures you with the slow dance and another encounter with a bear that makes the other bear defend her.

Your heart will go out to Tess but as she warms you will also see there is more to her than she hid. She also has the ability to accomplish much thanks to her determination and intelligence. Another taste of her and Curran soon finds himself addicted to her in such a way that she becomes more than just someone he watches over. He does have his own demons in which as they grow she will get him to begin to take steps in healing. Oh and that father and say that loosely because he is one sick daddy-o. Surprise is what he will do when he brings her before his siblings because of his standard dating material that to me shows he just wasn't looking in the right places. They will be what each other needs with what builds between them the excellent part of this reading. Danger will come forth though in more ways than one with when you are done know that you do not want to mess with Curran.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J6S3FC48A48P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI48WW#wasThisHelpful","R1J6S3FC48A48P","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first for me in reading any of this author's work. the title and the description drew me in. Once I opened the pages it was the writing that was a web that kept me there. Angus is one character that is predominate in here that you encounter first. He is sent to investigate missing dragons but also the truth in a death also. He can go between worlds and times which was fascinating reading within itself. He encounters Arianrhod whom is also sent to investigate. The two of them pair up and in doing so they also ignite something between them. He also is given some of his missing pieces but that road goes a different way than I expected. She is also what he dislikes but that does not seem to stand in their way once they come together. There is so much involved in here with many characters that bring this all about. Everytime they seem to be on to something, another question arises. There will be a gift from their time together that will be very important indeed. With very careful laid plans it will be quite interesting to see if it comes to pass. She does know how to put the heat with this lore that is the perfect combination to not want to miss a word.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22280Y4HGYE0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KAXWU6#wasThisHelpful","R22280Y4HGYE0C","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just the right follow up to the first one with even if you did not read it you still would not be lost. The writing style of this author is such that she engages you right away sweeping you away as Luke and Andi begin their own careers but still are together. The fire that consumes them both they have for each other is still burning bright. The thing is that at first they have not told each other there will be a separation period because of his training and her traveling with the band, along with her singing her own stuff. Trust will be the no.1 challenge for them. Saying and doing are two different things. Plus it does not help with media coverage and help from another corner of setting the stage to ignite that mistrust. As it consumes them this author will consume you right along with them playing you like a fine fiddle. You will also want to bang your head on the wall because of the media coverage that amps up the jealousy but you know the truth. Your heart will get twisted when Andi gets twisted. Your anger will engage when Luke gets angry but for different reasons. This is one fine emotional journey until it climaxes with truth comes to light and the wake up call will sound. You hope it will be heard and love will reign again. She will take care of you though do not fret and give you a ending that you will not want to smack her for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R203VYA7ZFYV7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692420983#wasThisHelpful","R203VYA7ZFYV7W","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time in reading this author for me and I sure did enjoy her writing style. She easily enticed me into the story with the intrigue of Sophia going to help it's owner sent by someone claiming to want to help save the inn. Oh and one of my favorites there are ghosts too. Garren needs a answer because he can not loose the inn. He has been its guardian for years but now it is time to save it. You are taken with these two as the hunt for something to help but come upon a mystery that even includes the one who sent Sophia. As they find some answers they are also given some clues that tie this together but time is of the essence. You also find out Garren secret when him and Sophia come together one night with her also being a very important key. though modern day it has a delightful touch of Gothic mystery romance, with them being so delightful to read. Excitement will fill the air bringing you to the edge when they work together to stop evil and save the inn but in doing so alot more will be gained that is the kind that lasts a lifetime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A62G8PE3XBYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01635YY5M#wasThisHelpful","R2A62G8PE3XBYK","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the start to a engaging series that in each one has its own brand of mystery. This one lets you know why these girls branch out on their own and they could not of made a better decision. Thanks in part to her uncle her and her friends are able to buy and take over a detective agency. River gets recommended by her uncle to a brother and sister who need her help with a cold case involving their parents. The elements are solid and prick the interest with intrigue right away, and on the back of that is contact with the one who initially handled the case. Gage will not be your average small town cop who thinks women can not be good at what they do but he is defensive none the less. Actually you get a pretty good feeling that Gage is one fine cop. As the time goes on in this they will even find a way to work together. Even though this is a basic who done it, it is stamped with her style and branded with romance that gives a warm touch to a murder mystery that needs solved. Along with this is another element that will need solving almost like a missing person's one that is key to the brother and sister. The characters are a delight and with everything that goes down with this one you will be caught up as you should be in a well written suspense. So at the end of this one I would say that River is very happy indeed with her decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZQDEEPGJ4RMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015G9XXDU#wasThisHelpful","R2ZQDEEPGJ4RMY","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time in reading this author and the title is what drew me in. To be honest though it took me a minute to get into the novel, my own fault really because after the prologue I got distracted by something else. So when I picked it up again after Danny has been retired and is approached by Angelica to temporary be in the agency my interest went into hyperdrive. Angelica is different and description by author excellent. The reason for their teaming up is to catch a killer of the vamperic kind one who Danny has be closer to than anyone of late. Vincent is a serial killer also, so heavy training for him. There are other paranormal they will go after in this time. During all of this you get to know these two intimately with Danny also getting flashes of the past. He soon finds out they are real. They are also getting closer to each other. There will be a event though that will drive Danny away except for business only which will pull on your heart strings for Angelica. You also find out why she is so special and wish he would quit being such a you know what. Anyways the more you read the deeper you become part of this novel and wanting to see more from this agency too. When you do get to the final parts you are transfixed wondering what will become of these two even if he did walk away. She has sympathy on her readers because it is not quite finished yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7RLU9YLJHR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUV5FCE#wasThisHelpful","R3H7RLU9YLJHR4","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first one for me to read by this author even though I have been wanting to for awhile now. If this is how she always writes than wowzer she is a keeper to turn to for reading. Some favorites are in this-bikes and wolves, oh and yummy guys. Lyric and her friends go out for the evening but she runs into a bit of trouble with some undesirables. Rowan does not let on he sees trouble but steps in for a rescue coming away with something extra for it. Lyric grabs him, his truck and her bike after claiming him for their pack and goes to his house to bide some time. She should of known though they would of not had much. This author then goes to give you their story along with how this pack deals with traitors and trouble. She also gets herself a mate that I would say fits her to a tee. Hard to explain but this was a quick excellent read that has lots of action and fire that quenches anyone's thirst. I found this group to also be a little different because of their club which is needed in today's plenty to choose from line up in this genre. I think Rowan will fit in quite nicely with them all especially Lyric.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I6L6PHISPO23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MCEQSC#wasThisHelpful","R3I6L6PHISPO23","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just love entering into novels that hold a big promise, one that will immerse me into a emotional sea. First it was the title, than the blurb that had me anticipating. The prologue is the beginning of the two actually even though you are caught up in the drama of the quickly unfolding event. Little girl Gracie will always remember her hero-David. The one though surprisingly that really holds on to that little girl is David. Time moves on they move on until one night they meet again by chance. Celebrating Jade and Gracie are out but there is also a third wheel who is not so nice. He gets meaner as the night rolls on and she has had enough. Just so happens the bar they are in is a firefighters bar and her hero will rescue her once again. Ian his friend and fellow mate eggs him about her. Who should show up at his station but Gracie with by now this author has my attention front and center. Once they establish later on at another place she is his Gracie they will begin the dance o fa much heated courtship. She also is going after her career and he has his nights he is on. Rolling along with them on their relationship will push your buttons for when you are reading something good that is building between two that fits them. Hold onto your hats though she will drop a emotional bomb that will rip you into pieces as it does these two. You will then experience the agonizing climb back with your heart going out to them both. Don't take life for granted cause it can change in a blink just like it did for these two. Only love will be the fuel that feeds Gracie and heals David. They will then have to build something different that will plant more in the ole emotional garden of the reader as it happens. Struggles will happen but the power of love will be clearly shown in the relationship, and if you never let go it will do more than survive. I have never read this author before but clearly she knows how to reveal the heart feeding the reader as she does it, because seriously this novel is one of the reasons we read modern day romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OPEKUZTBMXBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016J7ASI6#wasThisHelpful","R2OPEKUZTBMXBT","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Having had one memorable evening before he left he would never been forgotten. Now years later Avery is grown and needs a tow and her sneaky brother sends just the right tow and driver to pick her up-Severin. Having suffered many things from the night just before he left and thru the course of time he is now trying to heal following a different path. This author gives you their re connection with the chemistry that builds between them to make for one explosive coming together.

You fall in love with Adrian and Victoria even more than before especially now that they are on the same page. She will give you more of Simon and Sadie but oh that girl does have a temper with having a right to it. My favorite now is Zev who could not understand how the others you could fall to love but he will be oh so challenged himself. Tara who comes in to tell him something about one of his players who just happens to be the one who is getting more bolder, he begins to be bewitched I would say with how he begins to act. Seriously though he will have a inner tug of war of his own that will leave you giggling a time or two. They will come up with a plan that will involve Victoria making the biggest play of her career that will have you going ah huh ah huh and pins and needles will be a better statement.

From the beginning this has been different in many ways but have now learned that is how this author rolls delivering different. This one though out of all of them put me through the most in the emotional wringer. You know it is coming they say it is coming but you still will be unprepared. Rachel is so unique in character I have not read of anyone like her in a class of her own. The ones she is with go through to get ready, but the madman still will stick it to them all one final time. Of course she will after the horror they will witness make one final do or die bargain that I wanted to slap her for on the how. The action in this one will be draining for the reader. The sacrifices will be real and true colors will shine forth. Who survives and who doesn't will wish you had those tissues handy that were forgotten. The final pages will be the best of all with total agreement from me on that final decision or he would still have a hand in their destiny.

"With this one I had wanted to red for awhile now. I knew their time would come-Marina and Drew. This one also has the most poetic lines I think too. Of course it is not so easy either because Marina must remember. She will do that and more. Alexa is also getting closer to her destiny regardless if he wants her or not. this also tells more of the things about all of them then the proceeding ones that put alot of the pieces together for me for a better understanding especially as Marina understands. They have also some of their stranger events but they will be understood thanks to the pieces. This has been so far one unique and refreshing series with not one similar at all out there. I think also they have one of the most deserving times together especially since Drew felt it was better to stay away. The tide is turning and things are changing fast with the pace now speeding along with no down time. You will get a excellent meaning to this title when you read this one. There is one though in there group that has alot of resentment I would say if he wants to get over himself and what has happened to and behavior that has resulted where Alexa is concerned.

"This time period is a good one and quite fondly reminds me of when I would read biographies of Queen Mary and such. So when I picked this one up and started it I could very well relate to how things were and how careful to stay in favor. Deception was all around and someone was always trying to disrupt and put on the throne whom they thought it should be as in this one the same events. This one though will have a bit more intimacy thanks to the characters and the story this author will give. Catherine will be thrown under the bus sort of when after her father dies and how he does. When she goes out it will start with her being falsely accused and on the run. Brandon will come to her rescue and as their adventure goes forth in the search for the truth they will also discover what lies within their hearts. Seduction in those days if between the right two could be like music but oh so thrilling. This author captures that with these two inbetween the intrigue.

She knows how to get you right up front too with Micha who even though he was co-owner of a bar and a enforcer he bent over backwards to do right for his little girl. You could eat him right up or lap him up like a cat with a bowl of cream. Then there is Laurel who for not for lack of trying needs a summer job until her teaching job starts that her friend comes to the rescue and sits up a interview with her brother to sit with her niece. Wow is she in for a treat, cause he has no clue the real reason for the interview, sneaky sister of his. Anyways not all is lost and they come to a agreement but she must live with them. Now the hard part comes of the job, how to keep their hands to themselves. Delightful banter between them at times with him seeing just how much his daughter actually needed this. Actually in a way the sister came to the rescue for them both in more ways than one. Only one thing though he has a very tough side job that will get tougher and tougher. This is like bees and honey this one is because you can not quit reading. Since fear has a way of rearing its ugly head he will turn into a butt several times and at the end could cost him.

"At first I was not quite sure of this one because of the title which leaned toward kinda silly to me but remembered era it was set in. By the time I turned the last page (not realizing it was already) I was flabbergasted because it had quite surprisingly swept me away. The era, characters, and the storyline combined with the talent of this author is what had me hostage for a few hours. That was only how long it took me once I picked up the novel and after the turn of the first few pages that is all she wrote kinda way. Abigal might have been a Lady who did her best to follow her parents wishes but she has character. Poor thing though had the miss fortune to be betrothed to a scoundrel who was called a gentleman in their circles who was good at hiding his jerk of a nature unless you looked closely. It only took one chance encounter of her happening on one of his indiscretions, with that action of his to later have some deadly action take place to set the ball rolling. I was so caught up forgot for a moment even the era not now so good the writing with the suspense of wanting to know who did do it and how soon can she get away from him. Now Edmund gotta love him the practical man he was who will get brought down by impractical thing called love. This had the taste of what got me started years ago with romance in this era but then were termed Gothic romance because of the suspense. You also will be literally holding your breath until you see all will be right in the end. This is most definitely one that will leave you warm and cozy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12EIGO5VIG2WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MQS27Y#wasThisHelpful","R12EIGO5VIG2WG","A179INWJ0ZLOB4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179INWJ0ZLOB4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was really pleased with this Asus G751JY. I bought it because I'm a 3d artist, and was looking for something with a more robust videocard, ram, and harddrive space that was fast enough to render Iray in DAZ Studio 3d.  I priced several laptops, and they were all really expensive and less bang for your buck. Asus is a powerhouse, and works great. Yes it has windows 8.1 but I found after a few days I customized it the way I've liked it.  I tend not to upgrade notebooks from the OS They ship with, because I've had bad luck with drivers and support, but I have found this works fine with 8.1 with a few tweaks like restoring the start bar to a more normal appearance and disabling charms.There are a couple things I wish were a bit more clear. The documentation does not adequately describe how to disable edge swipe which is an annoyance on windows 8.1 There also really isn't a good trackpad control panel in the control panel windows.If you are looking to disable edge swipe it is on the task bar, so if you are looking for it (and I did for several hours). It  is on the taskbar and called Asus Smart Gesture.  You find it under the carrot menu.  To access it you must double left click to pull up the 8.1 swipe settings.Although the PC is new, I'm really pleased with it. This is a machine you might want to get if you are interested in a machine to do rendering and aren't Daddy Warbucks!I also wish there was a way to buy extended warranty from the manufacturer. The Asus site is a bit dated, and tough to find things on.

"I think this show is funny but the Jake/Santiago romance is irritating. I prefer them both single, and not pining for eachother every episode. There are only so many jokes you can do when the main character is hooked up. And the ""are they or aren't they"" is el bore-o.  Do like Boyle, Terry, and the captain, but not so into the silly on-again off-again  romance.

I found it charged my iPhone and iPad quickly without the fuss of trying to mess around and get the cables sorted out I also like the fact that it has a cradle and holds my phone and iPad upright while it charged.This is a nice basic that is working well so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GF3975QTEOSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW06D5G#wasThisHelpful","R1GF3975QTEOSR","ANEDXRFDZDL18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANEDXRFDZDL18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy nature photography and images of animals and our natural world. This book looked interesting and seemed to be right up my alley. It is a hefty volume of pictures, but I felt it was displeasing in some ways. There was no order to it, the images seemed to be printed on odd kind of paper, and I felt it was cacophonous and disconcerting to look through- like someone took an image dump off a nature feed on facebook and printed the pictures out and stuffed them in the book. Yes, some of them were quite beautiful and well-done but I didn't find myself drawn into this book the way I have with other nature image books. The size and placement and paper quality didn't overly impress me either. This was okay. But not anything I'd find myself reaching for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2105VLXG213UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607482#wasThisHelpful","R2105VLXG213UO","ANEDXRFDZDL18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANEDXRFDZDL18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Increasingly, research suggests probiotics are good for you, and can help with illnesses such as seasonal allergies and allergic rhinitis. The over use of antibiotics has decreased gut bacteria in the regular human and made taking supplemental probiotics necessary. If you don't want extra sugar or calories from consuming yogurt probiotic supplements like this one are a great choice. This blend is especially designed to withstand stomach acid and to recolonize the lower intestine.I regularly take probiotics since I've discovered it seems to help me with my allergies. This blend has 6 strains  and does not require refrigeration. They are in gel caps made of vegetarian material and include some filler and stabilizer.It takes a while to notice and discern if new supplements are working. So far, so good.

"This book is really a refreshing and funny read. It is basically about the sex life of sea critters. And believe me, this makes homo sapiens sex lives look pretty vanilla. As a person who enjoys writing, I found reading about the different ways sea creatures procreate to be interesting and enlightening. Who knew some of these creatures had such involved or curious anatomy. Lots of creativity for science fiction writer to be found in the real life sexual habits of sharks and other denizens of the deep.This book is not for the tame or staid reader. Sexuality is talked about in a frank and funny way. If you are offended by words like horny, or frank talk about anatomy and other words which might set off the censor here at amazon this might be a book to avoid.This would make a great book or tabletop reader for those who are curious about such things, someone who likes sea critters, or just that person with a great sense of humor who enjoys reading unusual things.

"I have allergies, and dry nose and sometimes asthmatic symptoms. I find that having a cool mist humidifier in my room helps me sleep better and breathe easier- as long as there is not too much humidity. I've been using a Remedies Cool Mist Humidifier which I quite like, but wanted to try a different one. Vicks Sweetdreams  is quite a bit bigger than Remedies. It is easy to load with water, and makes a pleasant cool stream of wet air. It has no noticeable odor.The projector is cute, but due to the location is rather awkwardly placed. The pictures are pretty, but the star ones seem a bit lame. With the projector at the back, it is awkwardly situated because some images project upside down and to get them right-side up you must turn it around Overall, I found it worked pretty well. It could use some design improvements mostly due to the location of the projector and the sound it makes when running.Updates: After using this for a while I found even with earplugs the sound of this device is far too loud.

"This is a visually appealing and beautiful keepsake music box by Lenox china. The box is nicely made, with an appealing beige base, and the typical Lenox china holly pattern. The space for trinkets is on the small side. Big enough for a few rings, a watch, or some coins, but not enough for major storage. This item would make a nice gift.Cons: I don't like the tune: ""Oh Come all ye Faithful."" As Christmas tunes go, it just isn't Christmassy enough and since the tune is somewhat repetitive it needs to go on longer, with more variance. The tune was short, and after hearing it 10 times I certainly had enough.. I think a different tune like Silent Night or Deck the Halls would be more recognizable, or better still, it should have more than one tune.My mom and sister both liked it, but Mom was a bit surprised it only played only a few bars of the same song. Repeatedly.Overall, this is a nice basic.

"This is a tiny, small inexpensive made portable demi-netbook, suitable for a child or someone whose computer needs are focused on internet activity or someone who doesn't have the money to purchase something more durable with a larger screen.  It came pre-loaded with windows 10, and full of software 'free for a while' that you will have to pay for after the subscription period ended. It is not super fast, but not super slow, although my 5 year old dell runs faster. For me it is functional, but closer to a toy than a piece of serious hardware. But if you take into mind the audience you are purchasing it for, it might suit a certain type of user. Someone who wants to chat, check facebook, browse Amazon, and whose vision is great, might do well on this small tablet-sized machine. For a person trying to do more, this machine might be too limited.It boots, and immediately wants to find your wifi router. Connecting to wifi was simple and easy. I was on the internet in minutes, mostly because I had to add this machine's mac address to my mac address filter.Looks wise, it is cute. It is bright blue plastic, resembling a toy computer. The keyboard is responsive, the track pad is a single piece, the screen narrow and tiny but appealing with a backdrop of pre-selected icy snow.I probably wouldn't purchase a machine like this, as I need more robust power, but if you are looking to gift grandma with a computer to check her email this might be something you might buy- as long as granny has good vision. I would be concerned about using this for children, as it is a heavily internet reliant piece of hardware, but that's each parents decision to make.This machine doesn't blow me away, but it isn't bad either.

"Designed for hard floors, the Bissel Symphony is an easy-to-use all-in-one steamer/mop vacuum with the punch to knockout dirt as well as to steam and mop up afterwards. Setup is easy. Just attach the handle, and plug it in and add water to the steamer using the provided cup. (or in my case, there was no cup for some reason, but a measuring cup worked just fine).The steamer works great out of the box. I filled the mop's reservoir and took it in the kitchen to begin mopping the pergo. It performed well- without chemicals or nasty smelling floor cleaners. It didn't even disturb the dog who was taking a nap. I made sure to keep the steam on lo, as the directions suggested.Switching on the vac device, turns on a powerful vacuum which will suck up dirt before it gets to your mop pad, which is very nice too. So this isn't just a steamer, but a vacuum as well.The instructions are a bit vague on some areas on how to use the device. For example, after use, do I clean the mop pads? (I assume yes, but it really doesn't say)  Do I leave them damp on the bottom of the mop? What? Where can I buy more pads? How much wear use can I expect to get out of them?I can see I will get a lot of use out of this, but wish there was a bit more detail on day-to-day operation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKUAOT7DUHM5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UM9N3I#wasThisHelpful","RKUAOT7DUHM5R","ANEDXRFDZDL18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANEDXRFDZDL18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have allergy to dust mites, and pet dander, so I was excited to get a vacuum that can help me with dust. Where I live- central California the weather really lends itself to dust mites since we don't get a lot of cold weather.This vacuum is really durable. Right out of the box all you do Is attach the front brush attachment and it is ready to go. It even had enough of a charge for me to get  cleaning right away. The instructions have a lot of warnings about what not to do with the vacuum... (Do not run it while operating a vehicle.... Really?) But don't have a lot to say. I read through them anyway. The info about cleaning will be useful. Anyway, I used it right away on the couch, sofa and cushions where dust mites lurk. It really has a lot of sucking power and I noticed that dust was getting removed quickly as I was using it. I found it great for removing the dust from furniture, cracks, and some chairs in the kitchen.  I really like the way it handled, the sucking power, and the feel of it working.The only negative I found with it, is it wasn't strong enough to remove pet hair sometimes. It was a bummer to remove dust and leave the little white pet hairs behind. That is why I dropped it down one star.Overall, though. I liked it.

"I have allergies and a history of asthma.  I  own a number of air filters for work and home.  This air filter  seems highly recommended, but I'm honestly disappointed that it really gives off a strong plastic smell when running.. The device has been running now for two days, and it still gives off an offensive plastic scent and god knows what VOC's. I have to keep the window open and let it run and leave the room because the smell is awful. That is really tough for people with chemical sensitivities and asthma. Ughh... Couldn't these machines be off-gassed and ran before sending them to people who have allergies?The strength of the air is appropriate for the size, but I can say the charcoal filter is not working because when I return home from running it with the window open.. My room smells strongly of plastic. It fails to even filter out it's own odor.At this point, I can't recommend it.  I can't use the device at all or be in the same room with it. How frustrating. I can see it will need an extended off-gassing period. No good for me.This would likely be okay, if you aren't sensitive to plastics, although I am skeptical of the healthfulness of anything that off-gasses and is made of plastic. I'd be careful using this without testing or knowing if the individual who will be using this can handle the strong odor it emits.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28KRQII345NPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5ZB5WQ#wasThisHelpful","R28KRQII345NPR","ANEDXRFDZDL18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANEDXRFDZDL18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"CONTAINS SPOILERS--- You are warned.I like Sharon Fisher's sci-fi ideas, but I actually don't like the romantic elements.This story, features Tess, a scientist who works at a paranormal institute studying trapped victims from a parallel world. She is compassionate, kind, but a bit scattered. There are two men in the story, although only one is slated to be the romantic lead. Ross, the stodgy by-the-book FBI Agent.Story-wise I liked the idea of an alternate reality. I think this would make a great idea for a film. I did find elements of the energy transfer to remind me a bit of Jacqueline Lichtenberg's sime~gen series..The romance was pretty bad I though (hence three stars). Ross was just this boring over-protective type. He does his best to protect Tess from herself, and seems happy to go along with the FBI's bad plans for Jake and the other Echoes, and if he wasn't in love with Tess, I get the feeling he would be working with the government to turn them into assassins. He wasn't awful but I found him wooden and stereotypical and wrong for Tess.Tess runs away from her problems, and although she has a kind heart, she has a history of abuse and falls immediately for Ross, disregarding Jake who seems quite a nice option.My primary reason I didn't like Ross/Tess, was that I would like to see Tess grow as a character and away from needing a masculine protector. Her abuse was sad,  but it would've been more fulfilling at least for me to see her grow out of needing someone to look after her. I also felt that Ross seemed a bit cold and reminded me a bit of Tess's evil father.The romance is shallow, with early sex, and no real reason for it, thus it never really took off for me as a romance. . The love triangle with Jake is a tease that goes nowhere, didn't really work, and reminded me of the other novel by the same author with the friendly bearded best-friend character who was also in love with the heroine.I think I would've liked it more as sci-fi series with a longer character arc, and a different type of relationship between the protagonists.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGT1RYFSGOOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765376377#wasThisHelpful","RYGT1RYFSGOOL","ANEDXRFDZDL18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANEDXRFDZDL18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This device is a blue light treatment wand for mild to moderate acne. It is not for use near the eyes as usage of this device near your eyes can cause blindness. The device is easy to use, with short one day treatments monitored by a charge module. The device is a comfortable weight and size, and comes with brief directions for  setup and day-to-day precautions. A set of goggles for blue light might also be advisable for areas close to the eyes, but not near the eyelid. The only downside that I can see is that the company charges for 'charges'. This is not a standalone device. To continue to use it, you will need to pay for additional charger modules. I don't like that. this device is already fairly pricy, and charging for charge refills seems a bit much.Actually using the device, involves plugging in the charging module/cartridge, charging it until it is full, and then applying to the affected area. you can use stickers on your face to guide the direction of the wand, but that didn't seem too helpful to me.

"I picked this one up because I was intrigued by schoolteacher solves a mystery and that I heard it was basically a 'gay Stephanie Plum novel.' It sounded kind of funny, as I really loved the early Stephanie Plum books and they were comedic. Well, I didn't find the story that funny, and Skyler was a bit of a spaz. His friends were just kind of off-beat characters. The romance between Skyler and the football coach was telegraphed, and I just wasn't feeling it. I don't know why.

"In my opinion, Electrolux produces the best stick vacuums you can buy. This vacuum, is perfect for the small home, or for use in an apartment or location where a full-size vacuum isn't necessary. It is easy for seniors to use and charge, the rollers don't get gunked up that often unless you have long-haired pets, and they are light-weight and perfect for using in places where a quick vacuum will touch up a floor, and are yet easy to use and store. It is also a rather attractive looking unit, with a nice profile, and a deep dark red.This vacuum doesn't have a complicated stand (although you can buy additional accessories), and can be put together in a matter of under 5 minutes. The charger goes into any standard plug, and the adapter plugs into the back handle.Like most stick vacuums, you will have to expect to empty the cup, and tap out and replace the filters every so often. But this isn't too difficult. The handheld vac detaches for quick cleanup of spills or small area cleanup, like blinds, windowsills, or corners where the regular vacuum is too big.This would be a great gift for someone going off to college, a senior, or to keep in the closet upstairs for touching up the bathroom, living room, or stiars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CX1TXCTONKCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQHJV8C#wasThisHelpful","R2CX1TXCTONKCB","ANEDXRFDZDL18","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANEDXRFDZDL18?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It had however, a strong minty scent and flavor which sort of annoyed my throat.  However, I found that the second time I used it my right sinus also became irritated. I also was not terribly keen on the rubbery bits of odd stuff which come out of your nose when the coating begins to fail.

"I have used a couple of FM Transmitters in order to play music from my phone in my car.  I have an older car that doesn't have Bluetooth and using an FM transmitter allows me to utilize my car stereo with my iPhone.  I do prefer this type of FM Transmitter versus the ones that are one unit that plug into the cigarette plug.This FM transmitter is all one piece with an optional included mount.  On one end of the FM transmitter is a 3.5mm cable that you plug into the headphone jack on the phone or iPod and on the other end is the cigarette plug charger. One the cigarette charger is a spare 2.4A USB port which comes in handy for keeping my phone charged. Setting up the scanner is easy.  The transmitter auto scans to find the best station to play music from. Synch up the FM station on the stereo with the FM Station on the transmitter and that's it.The FM transmitter has enough stations to choose from to ensure that interference does not occur. I have had previous experiences with FM transmitters that sometimes there is a buzzing sound on the speakers. Do not notice the same issue with this transmitter. This FM transmitter is also able to provide hands-free conversations via the car speakers which works great.Overall, great FM transmitter.

"I got the USpicy Makeup Brushes 8 Pieces Make Up Brushes and am quite pleased with the quailty.  It is a 8 peice makeup brush set with an included carrying pouch.  The carrying pouch makes it a great option for traveling.  The carrying pouch has a leather look to it but it is actually made of plastic.  There is an internal compartment to hold each brush individually and a button to keep the case securely closed.  All the essential brushes are included: Loose Powder Brush, blush brush, angled definer brush, blending brush, eye shadow brush, eyeliner brush, eyebrow brush and a lip brush.  The brush set is also available with a brown wooden handle or a white wooden handle on amazon.  The quality of the handles and bristles are great. No difference in quality that I can tell from the single pack brushes that you can get in retail stores. It is great for giving as a present or as a replacement for older brushes. The bristles are made of both synthetic fibers and natural hair depending on the brush.  They also don't have a problem with shedding which is great even after washing.  The bristles retain their softness and stay gentle on the skin even after washing.These compare well with more expensive brand name brushes such as Sigma and MAC and are way better then drugstore brushes as well as cheaper.

"I got the USpicy Makeup Brushes 8 Pieces Make Up Brushes and am quite pleased with the quailty.  It is a 8 peice makeup brush set with an included carrying pouch.  The carrying pouch makes it a great option for traveling.  The carrying pouch has a leather look to it but it is actually made of plastic.  There is an internal compartment to hold each brush individually and a button to keep the case securely closed.  All the essential brushes are included: Loose Powder Brush, blush brush, angled definer brush, blending brush, eye shadow brush, eyeliner brush, eyebrow brush and a lip brush.  The brush set is also available with a brown wooden handle or a white wooden handle on amazon.  The quality of the handles and bristles are great. No difference in quality that I can tell from the single pack brushes that you can get in retail stores. It is great for giving as a present or as a replacement for older brushes. The bristles are made of both synthetic fibers and natural hair depending on the brush.  They also don't have a problem with shedding which is great even after washing.  The bristles retain their softness and stay gentle on the skin even after washing.These compare well with more expensive brand name brushes such as Sigma and MAC and are way better then drugstore brushes as well as cheaper. Really can't beat the quality. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new brush set. I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LN16ZP9O39MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017693L80#wasThisHelpful","R1LN16ZP9O39MW","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two Shihtzu's and if they don't have their hair combed it can get knotted especially after baths.  Not to mention they tend to like being combed.  This is the first two in one brush that I have tried and I do prefer it.  It's one less brush that I have to look for and one less brush I have to store.  The brush has a head that is also flexible so it isn't so stiff against the dogs body when brushing him.  I do prefer the brush over the comb for my Shihtzu but I do use the comb for the ears and tails.  Both the brush and comb do a good job of holding onto the hair until it is ready to be removed and thrown away. The grips on both items are good as well and feel comfortable in the hand.  Both items look to be well made have been holding up well so far. Overall, this a great set of grooming tools that is gentle enough on the pets yet still functional.  I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D0X05EKBB2VR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0178WDRIO#wasThisHelpful","R2D0X05EKBB2VR","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bluetooth 2-in-1 Adapter, TaoTronics Wireless Audio Transmitter/Receiver Dongle is great for adding Bluetooth capability to a home stereo system.  I have my music library on my iPhone but prefer listening to music on my home stereo system.  The Bluetooth adapter allows for that.  It's straightforward and easy to setup, just plug the 3.5mm cable into the input on the stereo and pair the dongle to your phone and that's it.  This dongle is actually both a transmitter and receiver which is great to have the option. Although I am only using the receiver option of it for my home stereo.  Switching from transmitter to receiver is done by just flipping a switch.  The dongle has a builtin battery that lasts roughly 8 hours as well as being able to run while plugged into AC power.  Sound quality from my iPhone to stereo system is great and the range of the Bluetooth 33 feet.  Overall this is a great device to give a non-Bluetooth device Bluetooth capability.I was provided a sample product for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QFU8O9O1J9YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013OK2C6W#wasThisHelpful","R2QFU8O9O1J9YI","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for the Aerb Pro Selife Stick.  What I like most about this selfie stick is that it has a standard 1/4in mount connector, similar to the ones on tripods.  This makes the selfie stick compatible with digital cameras as well as GoPro's. This is not a feature that I have found on many selfie sticks, the typical selfie stick just has the abilty to hold a cell phone and that's it.  This unique feature makes this selfie stick a buy for me over other ones.The selfie stick works by connecting via Bluetooth.  This is a Bluetooth Selfie Stick and pairing is straightforward and easy. No issues were encountered pairing the stick with my iPhone 5s. The operation button is perfectly placed on the end of the handle. This button is used to power on the stick, pair the stick as well as take the picture. At the bottom of the stick is the micro USB charging port.  Since the Bluetooth wouldn't be compatible with a digital camera I have found that using the timer setting works just as well.The selife stick extends out from 32cm to 98cm.  Extending and retracting the selfie stick is smooth.  I have found that some selfie sticks  take a lot of elbow grease to extend and retract.  The selife stick does not feel flimsy at all when full extending and is lightweight enough to easily operate in one hand. There is a U shaped clamp at the end of the stick that is used for gripping a phone. The top and bottom of the clamp has a rubber cushion to keep the phone secure and from getting damaged. An iphone 5s fits perfectly within the arms of the holder. The selfie stick also has a built-in 80 mAH rechargeable battery that lasts roughly 40 hours in operation and 100 hours on standby.  The battery life is typical for selfie sticks.Overall, I am quick pleased with this selfie stick. It works great, easy to use, compact enough to easily carry in a purse or bag and love that it has a tripod mount for use with GoPro's and digital cameras.  I was provided a sample product for testing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27N3Q9YJQ8532/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGHA7FW#wasThisHelpful","R27N3Q9YJQ8532","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got the Anker [5-Pack] PowerLine Micro USB cables for review purposes.  This is a nice set of cables that comes with two 1ft, two 3ft and one 6ft cables.  I love the 1 foot cables for charging my devices with a portable power bank.  The 3 feet and 6 feet cables are great for connecting devices to cables or charging devices from wall adapter.  Now for the cables themselves they are premium quality.  Not like the cheap aftermarket OEM cables where the tip ends up breaking off or the cable sheath ends up getting torn when run over by a chair.  This set of Anker cables has Kevlar reinforcement, made of thicker gauge wires and has been stress tested up to 10,000 bends.  The 10,000 bend stress testing is important as this is a typical weak point of a cable.  I have used these cables with my Samsung S5 and didn't run into any issues with compatibility.  I have used both the 1 ft with a power bank and the 3ft to connect the phone to my computer.  Overall, these are a quality set of durable cables that should last quite some time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z74W2WWPMNTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XPQ5KK#wasThisHelpful","R2Z74W2WWPMNTF","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Huawei 10W 5V/2A Traveler Wall Charger.  I feel that this charger is better for home / office use than as a travel charger.  For travel chargers I prefer multiple USB ports as well as foldable plugs. Also this charger has the capability for trickle charging which is great for office use and keeping the phone fully charged.  The charger itself is well constructed and seems very durable.  It is made of plastic.  The USB port on the charger is capable of outputting up to 2A which is good enough for recharging a cell phone.  The USB port is snug and no issues of loose connections.  The charger is also dual voltage being able to support both 110v and 240v, which does make it great for worldwide use.  The charger dimensions is: 2.8 in x 2 in x 0.9 in and the weight comes in at roughly 1.6 oz.  I tested this charger with my iPhone 4s as well as utilizing it to recharge my USB speaker.  Both applications worked great.  Overall, this is a great charger from a well known company.

"The Huawei AM08 Bluetooth speaker is such a cool looking device.  It has a futuristic modern high end look to it.  It has some very cool features to it such as touch control button and light notification.  For instance when a call comes in a red light constantly flashes for visual notification.  Pairing the device is straightforward and the speaker can also be paired to two devices at the same time. Bluetooth operation is roughly 10 meters, which isn't the longest distance but is manageable.  There is a built-in rechargeable lithium battery that lasts roughly 5 to 6 hours and is fully recharged in 3 hours.  The speaker can also be used which it is plugged into a power source.  Sound of the speaker is great for its size.  The highs are clear as well as the mid-ranges.  Bass is somewhat lacking but this is a roughly 2 watt speaker so that is understandable, as well as being meant for phone use as well as music.  Overall, sound is well balanced for both listing to music and for phone calls.Overall, I love the design of this speaker and features. It is comes nicely package and would be great as a gift.  The touch operation of the speaker paired with the lighting effects is a great aspect of it.

"I got the Aukey Quick Charge 2.0 10000mAh Portable External Battery. The power bank slim and sleek looking. There are two USB ports and the device is able to charge two devices simultaneously. The battery pack came with one USB cable as well to charge the device, no wall charger is included. The device is working great thus far. Charging times on the power bank are a little better that when using a wall charger to charge my iPhone 4s. The power bank can also be used to charge devices when you are charging the power bank, which is a nice.Standout Features:- I love that the battery level indicator is the logo Aukey Logo itself. If the logo is Red that there is 0% to 20% battery left, Grey 20% to 60% and white 60% to fully charged.- The turbo recharge feature is another great feature. Since this is a 10,000 mAh battery pack recharge times can take 6 to 8 hours typically and sometimes more. Being able to fully recharge in 4 to 5 hours is surprising.- The Qualcomm certified Quick Charge 2.0 is a great feature for those who have compatible devices. iPhones sadly aren't one of them so this is not a feature I could take advantage of. What this feature allows though is faster charging time for those compatible devices- Sony battery cells. I like that the Aukey is disclosing the type of cells used. Sony is a brand that I trust when it comes to electronics. We have all heard the stories of off-brand batteries overheating and causing injury.- Built-in LED flashlightTo give a rough idea of the amount of times you would be able to fully recharge your devices battery here is a list of device battery capacities:* iPhone 4 Battery (1420 mAh)  6 to 7 recharges* iPhone 4S Battery (1432 mAh)  5 to 6 recharges* iPhone 5 Battery (1434 mAH)  6 to 7 recharges* iPad 2 Battery (6944 mAh)  1 and a half recharges* iPad 3 Battery (11560 mAh)  close to one full recharge* iPad 4 Battery (11486 mAH)  close to one full recharge* iPad Mini Battery (4490 mAH)  1  to 2 recharges* Kindle Fire Battery (4400 mAh)  1  to 2 rechargesOverall, this is still an excellent battery pack.

"This has to be one of the most attractive difussers I have come accross yet.  I love the all white look to it.  It reminds me of a porcelian ceramic vase although it is made of plastic.  The diffuser is able to hold up to 500 ml of water and has an auto shut off feature if no more water is left.  The diffuser can pretty much last the whole day on the low mist mode, 16 hours to be specific. In high mist mode it lasts up to 8 hours.  The diffuser has multiple settings as well: low or high mist, timer to include 1, 3 or 6 hours, continous mode, as well as 7 color LED option.  One thing worth mentioning is also how super quiet the diffuser is when operating.This is an electric diffuser so it does require an outlet.  Although since it is electric it is safer then open flame diffusers as well as cheaper.  You can use one estential oil or mix them up for the scent that you wish.  There are recipes online for for different estential oil mixtures and associated health benefits.  The diffuser does a great job of adding aroma to a room.  With the high or low mist setting it is easy to get the mist flow that suits the room best.Overal, the diffuser looks and works great.  I have nothing negative to say about it.

"For protecting your cell phone screen there are really two options tempered glass screen protectors like this one or PET (plastic) screen protectors.  In my opinion PET screen protectors are good for preventing the screen from getting scratched up or preventing glare, etc.  Tempered glass screen protectors are good for both keeping your screen from getting scratched up and from breakage.  Tempered glass screen protectors are like adding another layer of glass to your phone, somewhat like double windows.  There is a price difference between tempered glass and PET screen protectors though but to me tempered glass is more than worth it.  It is a lot easier to replace a screen protector than it is to replace the actual phone screen.I have tried other Aukey products and they are a great brand and make quality products.  This screen protector from Aukey is lower priced than competitors but the quality is just as great.  Included are the tempered glass screen protector, alcohol wipe, two home button stickers and micro fiber cloth.  This is pretty much typical for screen protectors.  The home button stickers are optional to use.  They are included as tempered glass screen protectors are thicker than PET screen protectors and have more of a raised surface. One issue that can occur with tempered glass screen protectors is a loss of responsiveness.  I was happy to find that with this screen protector, responsiveness was not affected.  This protector also doesn't have much of an issue with smudges.  Installing is pretty straightforward and takes only minutes.  Installing in a steamy bathroom does help with the dust issue as the steam helps weigh down the dust in the air.Overall this is a great quality tempered glass screen protector.  The cost is really attractive and installation is a breeze.  Great economical way to protect the iPhone screen.

"The Moonmini Vibrance Series iPhone 6S Case is perfect.  It is a slim protective case that doesn't add bulk to the iPhone. It is available in multiple colors.  I ended up getting the cherry pink and champagne gold case and I'm in love with the colors.  The cherry pink looks great and the champagne gold helps highlight the pink.  The case has a soft rubber inner backing so that it doesn't scratch up the back of your phone as well.  The cut outs are perfectly matched up and I love that it's just not a circular or square cutout.  It gives the case a unique attractive look.  The outer case itself is made of hard plastic giving the phone a shell to protect against scratches and drops.

"I got the Eva Medical Pedal Exerciser for review purposes and have used it a couple of times already.  The mini bike is one solid piece so no assembly is required.  The bike has a chrome finish and is steel frame. There are four rubber feet to keep it from moving as well as a plastic pedals and straps.  I have been using this with socks only and it is comfortable enough on the feet to do so.  There is a tension knob on the top of the mini bike.  You are not going to get the same amount of tension as on the exercise bikes though.  The mini bike is more comparable to pedaling on a flat open road. I have been using this when reclining back in my chair watching tv and it has been working great.  One thing I ended up noticing is that the metal arm for the pedal can get hot after a while of pedaling.  I am not sure if this is typical of the mini bikes as this one is the first I have tried but I think it is due to having the tension knob as tight as it could go and pedaling for a while.Overall, the mini peddler works as it should.

"The Codream Micro Perforated Stainless Steel Colander 5 Quart is quite a step up from the mesh strainer I currently have.  I actually needed a new strainer as the current one I have, the plastic rim cracked.  This one is 10 times better in quality, design and function.  I love that it is made of all stainless steel and no plastic at all.  I also love that it has a bottom foot to help with draining water when having it placed down.  Instead of having to place the strainer in the pan I can place the strainer directly in the sink.  I was actually watching a cooking show on the Food Network and was surprised to see a colander same in design to this one.  If this type colander design is good enough for a cooking show it's good enough for me.I do like that there are drainage holes from the top of the bottom of the Colander, not only does this help with water escaping faster but air drying as well. The holes are also small enough to keep food from falling out but not to where it hampers drainage.Overall, I am happy with this colander.  It is durable, works great and has a professional kitchen look to it.  I expect it to last a long time and it will be getting a lot of use.

"This is the first time I have tried a folding bucket.  I actually didn't know they even existed, but what a cool idea.  A bucket that is easy to store, lightweight and compact.  The bucket comes with a zippered storage bag which isn't required but is a plus to keep things neat.  The bucket is made of waterproof fabric and is great for a multitude of applications such as RVing, camping, the beach and even fishing.  The bucket can be used to transport liquids such as water or to keep drinks cold. Included with the bucket is a small removable handle.  Since the bucket is foldable and made of fabric it can collapse at times when placed on a surface.  This doesn't happen often but the possibility is still there.  I have found that either filling the bucket fully or just inserting a couple of wooden stir sticks keeps this from happening, this is more of a precaution then anything else.  So far the bucket has been working great.  I have used it to keep water in and wash the car as well as have ice in to keep drinks cold on the beach.  I have been leaving it in the car and it takes up barely any space which is great.  It is small enough to fit into the side compartment.  The bucket also tends to dry quickly so no issues with keeping it out to air dry overnight.  Overall the bucket is well constructed and is really convenient.

"This is a review for the TaoTronics Globe String Lights model TT-SL205.  There are 25 Clear G40 5W light bulbs that are 26 feet long.  The nice thing about this product is that the lights are extendable up to 3 more sting of lights.  Another thing is if one bulb goes bad the string of lights still works.  One spare replacement bulb is also included.  The lights use a standard C7/E12 socket and can be replaced with other lights as well, colored or clear bulbs.  One thing to keep in mind is that the power cord does not have a long leed before the bulb starts on the line, there is about 6 inches between the bulb and plug, same on both ends. Between each bulb there is 1 foot of spacing.The string of lights is great for a number of applications.  I have mine strung around my porch railing and it looks great.  The lights are bright enough but not blinding.  There does look to be a fuse in the plug, although I did not remove it to verify.Overall, the bulbs work great.

"The TaoTronics Pet UV Urine Detector Flashlight model TT-FL002 is great. It is well made and heavy duty. This model is Taotronics second versus of the UV flashlight, I have the first version as well and have added a picture for side by side comparision.

The UV light is easy to operate. It is turned on and off by the rubber button on the side of the flashlight. The UV flashlight also comes with a languard.When I looked up the uses for UV lights I saw some applications that I wasnt aware of. Some uses are: Pet Urine stains Rodent contamination Help detect bed bugs Hunt scorpions Detecting leaks with UV dyes Finding certain minerals Detecting counterfeit currency and productsI myself tried this out to look for urine stains from our two dogs, which it did find. It is easier to detect with the UV light with the lights off. The light emits a purple hue which is easier to see in darkness. I also tried this looking at US money and did see some things with the UV light that I never knew were there and that werent as easily visible with the naked eye.Overall, this is great to have. It is extremely portable and easy to carry around in a pocket. The 51 LEDs does make a difference in making things easier to see. If you have indoor pets I would highly suggest getting this as pets tend to go in the same spot specially if not cleaned up properly.I was provided a sample unit for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGW0MODL4O77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015W17OSW#wasThisHelpful","R1EGW0MODL4O77","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for the Retractable Dog Leash by TaoTronics.  I has a 16ft length with dimensions of 6.1in x 4.25in x 1.38in.  It is rated for dogs up to 110 lbs.  This retractable dog leash is pretty heavy duty and does have some weight to it. It is constructed of ABS plastic and seems to be pretty durable.  The handle has a rubber coating to aid in gripping and comfortability.  The lead on the leash is made of nylon fabric and seems pretty durable.The leash retracts automatically picking up the slack or giving slack smoothly. There is a brake button at the top of the handle that will keep the leash at the current length as well.  The brake button is easily operated with the thumb. The brake can be set in the permeant lock setting or pressed for temporary lock.  I put the lock in permanent lock and pulled on the lead and it didn't budge. The leash is easy to operate with one hand and has an extra wide handle for a comfortable grip.When comparing a retractable tape leash like this one versus a retractable rope leash, the tape leash wins no hands down. Tape leashes are far more superior and safer while as retractable rope leash is thinner making it harder to see. If the rope leash gets wrapped around you or the dog it also has the potential for causing injury. Tape leashes while not only safer are also easier to manage in that they have less of a tendency to get tangled or knotted. Also for any tape of retractable leash it is safer for the dog to have it connected to a harness versus a collar. With retractable leashes if the dog runs and comes to the end of the length or if the brake is suddenly applied then the dog can be abruptly pulled back.Overall this is a great leash. I have used Flexi retractable leashes in the past both rope and tape versions and I can say that this one compares nicely. A nice addition to this leash is that it comes with a light that can be attached to the dogs collar.  I was provided a sample product for review purposes and I am a dog owner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R207GYHMEPFPH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155XV9KG#wasThisHelpful","R207GYHMEPFPH2","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this case for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and it is just gorgeous.  The case comes in a clear plastic wrap with foam on the inside for the case to keep it's shape.  The case is made of faux white leather with slots on the inside flap for storing credit cards or folded up bills.  The inside of the case is brown and the material looks to be leather but may also be faux leather as well.  There is also an included black wristlet that can be attached to the side top eye hole. The design aspects of the front of the case look to be glued on and include the word Love, the Eifel Tower, two butterflies, three square rhinestones as well as smaller round rhinestones on the front. I haven't had issues yet with any of the pieces falling off.  The latch on this case is also magnetic, which helps in keeping the cover securely closed and keeping items in the inside slots protected. The case is lightweight yet still offering great protection. The siding of the case is white silicone which goes well with the rest of the case. The silicone is soft and thick enough to provide adequate protection. The back of the phone also is protected by the same silicone material as on the sides. The silicone is not only for protection but for holding the phone in the case.Overall I am quite happy with this case. It is a great design and has been holding up very well.

"This is a review for the Moonmini FreeCall LC-B41 Bluetooth 4.0 Headset. This headset has the longest battery running time that I have come across on a Bluetooth headset coming in at 24 hours.  No worries about the headset dying in the middle of the day. The headset also is able to display the battery level on Apple IOS phones, this is a feature that I love.  The headset also has voice support meaning that it will respond to voice commands.  The headset is available  in black, white and gold.  I got the gold one and love the color.  Typically I see headsets in black only so the choice of color is refreshing.I really like how it's light weight and fits perfect on my ear and doesn't kill it after wearing for a while. The headset is comfortable and extremely lightweight.  It doesn't make my ear sore at all and the the sound quality is great.  I have had issues in the past where a headset made my ear sore which means it doesn't get used. The headset has a nice modern look to it and is easy to use. Pairing with the iPhone 4s is easy and takes under a minute. It has the typical functions that most headsets come with and is priced relatively reasonably. Overall the headset has been working great and I don't have any complaints.Specifications:Bluetooth Version: 4.0Talk time: Approx 24 hrsStandby time: Approx 40 daysCharging time: Approx 3 hrsMusic Play time: Approx 22 hrsRange: 10 metersPairing: up to 2 DevicesIncluded: Bluetooth Headset, USB Cable and two ear clipsI was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YX2UB7H2FVUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCTCAHM#wasThisHelpful","R2YX2UB7H2FVUG","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got the USpicy Makeup Brushes 32 Pieces Set - Black and I must say when I first opened the package I was estatic.  This is a great set of brushes for both a starter and professional.  Each brush is roughly less than 50 cents each which is a steal.  The quality of the handles and bristles are great as well.  No difference in quality that I can tell from the single pack brushes that you can get in retail stores.  This brush set actually has more brushes then I am use to.  Some brush types I have actually never used before but am happy to try out.  It is great for giving as a present or as a replacement for older brushes.  These are my favorite brushes to use now and I love that it comes with a storage case.- Brushes are synthetic which makes them great for people with allergic tendencies towards natural hair brushes- Very minimal shedding, really only when washing the brushes for the first time- Brushes are very pretty and look like professional brushes- Included is a brush for just about every purpose that you could think of- Not heavy in the hand and not to light to where they feel cheap- Blending of makeup is smooth- Bristles are really soft and gentle on the skin even after washing- Work great with both powder and liquid makeupThese compare well with more expensive brand name brushes such as Sigma and MAC and are way better then drugstore brushes as well as cheaper. Really can't beat the quality for the price.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new brush set.

"I have been using LED light bulbs for quite some time now but this is the first time trying them from an amazon supplier.  The quality and performance of the TaoTronics LED Bulbs is just as good as the Sylvania or Utilitech brand bulbs from the big department stores such as Home Depot and Lowes.  I do prefer LED bulbs over incandescent bulbs, I feel that they save on electricity, last longer as well as work just as well.This is a six pack of Taotronics LED bulbs 9W.  The bulbs come in a box and are individually boxed within the larger box.  Per the instructions the bulbs are designed for indoor use and are not waterproof nor recommended in high moisture locations.  The bulbs are also covered by a 12 month warranty from defects from TaoTronics.  The bulbs are a replacement for 60W incandescent bulbs, thus brightness level is comparable.Technical Specifics:Model: TT-LB01Voltage: AC 120 60HzPower: 9WColor Temperature: 3000K (warm)Lumens: 810 lumensLifespan: 25000hThe light output from these are a soft white with a hint of yellow.  The bulbs work great, don't make any noise and don't take an time to warm up.  Not to mention they are also mercury free.  Overall these are a great set of LED lights at a great price with no complaints to speak of. As a disclosure, I was provided a sample product for testing and review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTH2YLBAXMRV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CODTUO#wasThisHelpful","RTH2YLBAXMRV9","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have high hopes for the Anker PowerLine Micro USB (1ft) cable.  I think I have gone through it all with OEM and aftermarket cables.  End connectors breaking off in my devices charging point, the cable sleeve getting torn, the end connector separating from the cable itself as well as cables dropping connectivity by the slightest touch.This cable from Anker features the following:-Reinforced with Kevlar fiber-10,000 bend lifespan-Hard PVC reinforcement to ensure connector doesn't break-Compact connectors to ensure case compatibilityWhen picking up the cable you can definitely feel the difference in construction.  It feels to be constructed of higher quality material.  I have a feeling that this cable will be able to stand up to being left in the car with blazing temperatures as well as being rolled over or stepped on.  I actually feel that it is better than the OEM cables that came with my device.  I tested this out with my phone and powerbank and no issues with charging.  The connectors fit snugly in the charging ports and the end connector is easy to grip to remove.Overall, the cable has been working out great.  It shouldn't be to hard to make a quality cable but for some reason it is.  I feel confident in this cable from Anker and have no reservations on recommending it to anyone.  This was provided as a sample product for testing purposes and has not at all swayed my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3828IP264F3MD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VRS178#wasThisHelpful","R3828IP264F3MD","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for the TaoTronics Portable Multi-angle Tablet/Smartphone Stand. This device is similar to a stand that I have for my books, something I tend to use pretty often as well as some stands that come with some cases. I actually had a similar stand on my Otterbox case for my iPad, and I went with that case just because of the stand. Although the hinge ended up snapping, plus the case was bulky and heavy. This type of standalone stand is so better, as it is more lightweight, can be used with multiple devices and compact as well.The stand is made of aluminum with rubber padding to keep the device from getting scratched. The case is small enough to be easily portable and is pretty lightweight. The stand has multiple viewing options, 11 different angles to be exact and can support devices in both vertical and horizontal positions. Not to mention the case is compatible with multiple manufacturer devices. So if you have a kindle, iPad, Samsung Tab you should have no issues. Although I tried this with only my iPad and Samsung Tab so can only speak to those two devices, but it worked perfectly. The stand works great for making videos with my Samsung Tab. To change the viewing angle of the stand all is needed it to press the button on the side of the stand. The stand also has a circular cut out to run cables through.Overall, I rate this stand 5 stars as it does fit a need and works as it should as well as being super convenient.

"This is a great grow light for indoor plants.  I actually have the first Taotronics grow light which this one is a newer improved model.  The difference between the two is this one is 12 LEDs at 2W versus the original version 12 LEDs at 1w.The light is quality made and the same design as the original grow light.  The original grow light from Taotronics is still available from Amazon and is cheaper if you are good with 1W LEDs. The light does not get overly hot nor does it put off a lot of heat. The lamp itself and bulb are surprisingly cool to the touch, no worries about this bulb cooking the plants.  The light has a ribbed design on the sides that aid in keeping the bulb cool.  The bulb has 12 LEDs (3 blue & 9 red). The bulb is constructed of both plastic and metal and does have some weight to it.Past experience with the original bulb was great and did wonders for my plants.  I am expecting the same or better results from this bulb.Overall, I am quite impressed with the grow lights from Taotronics.  They work great and can be up in running in seconds.

"I have always wanted to try these type of lenses out to see how well they work.  I tend to have my phone with me all the time which makes it convenient to take pictures with. Overall, I am quite pleased with these lenses thus far.  They give different options for taking pictures, are small enough to have in your pocket as well as easy enough to use.  Still waiting to see how durable they end up being.The lenses are great quality.  Picture quality is crisp and clean.  They come with three different lenses (fish-eye lens, macro lens and wide angle lens), two clips for holding the lenses as well as a microfiber cleaning cloth.  The clips are constructed so that they are able to fit on different phones whether it be a Samsung or Apple model.  I tried this on my Samsung Tab and my iPhone 4s and both instances worked great.  My favorite lenses of the pack are the macro and wide angle.  I might not even bother with carrying around the fish-eye lenses with me. In order to use the macro lens you have to unscrew it from the wide angle lens (they come screwed together).  In order to use the wide angle lens the macro lens and the wide angle lens are combined.The lens package is great the only downside is that it doesn't come with a carrying case.  To keep the lenses clean from dust, dirt and fingerprints as well as to keep them protected a carrying case would be nice.  Also if your camera has flash using the lenses may cover the flash, just something to keep in mind.Overall, the lenses are great and give additional options for using your phone for photography.

"The USpicy Sleep Mask with Ear Buds and Travel Pouch is great.  If you have trouble sleeping when it is not pitch dark then this is the solution.  Typically I dont like eye masks due to the fact that the ones I have tried are flat against my eyes and not comfortable.  This from USpicy is designed differently in that there are eye contours in which you can open or blink your eyes and not feel the mask.  It provides for a more comfortable feeling on the face and I was pleasantly surprised when I had it on.  The eye mask does a great job of blocking out the light.  When I had it on I didnt notice any light coming though, it was pitch black.  There is a Velcro strap head band that goes around your head to keep the mask in place.  Even the head band isnt that much noticeable.  The material of the eye mask is great; it is super soft to the touch. The eye mask comes with a carrying pouch to help keep it clean as well as ear plugs with their own plastic storage.  You really have to try on the eye mask to appreciate it.  Overall the mask is simply great and I am really happy with it.  Ill be surely bringing this with when traveling on airplanes to help with falling asleep easier.

"The Anker Foldable Solar Panel is really unique and such a great device. It is a portable environmentally friendly source of power. Pair this device with a Portable Battery Packs and then you have the solar device to create power and the portable battery to store it until when you need it. I wish that someone would come out with a solar panel that had a built-in rechargeable battery. Of course you could always just plug your device directly into the built-in USB ports on the solar device but this only works in the daytime. The device has two: PowerIQ (Smart) USB ports that can charge a device up to 2.1A. No issues with pairing this with a iPhone 4s, Samsung Tab or portable battery pack.The device consists of two solar panels connected to two USB ports. The USB ports are enclosed in an attached pouch of which you can also use to put your device to charge so it stays secure. The pouch has a Velcro opening to keep things secure. The solar panel folds to the size of a small book making it easy to transport.- Perfectly designed for outdoor use  water and weather resistant nylon casing- Comes with hooks that can be used to hang or secure the solar panels to an object- Works without any issues or fuss and super easy to setup- Great for an emergency or survival kit- This is solar and solar isn't know for charging the fastest so I suggest pairing this with a battery pack. The solar panel recharging the battery pack and the battery pack charging your device.To me this is a must have device. Just for the single reason of it being solar would make it a purchase for me. If you have been in a blackout or had situations where you were remote with no power source than the usefulness of this device is easily understandable. I have other solar panels both three and two panel and this one performs just as well. The main difference is that this one has Anker's PowerIQ technology for the USB ports.I was provide a product for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYWQKKJ1ZALWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012YZXMZS#wasThisHelpful","RYWQKKJ1ZALWY","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for the Amzdeal Retractable Tape Dog Leash.  The leash has a retractable length up to 13ft and supports dogs up to 88 pounds.

The leash is easy to operate with one hand and has an extra wide handle for a comfortable grip.When comparing a retractable tape leash like this one versus a retractable rope leash, the tape leash wins no hands down.  Tape leashes are far more superior and safer while as retractable rope leash is thinner making it harder to see.

Also for any tape of retractable leash it is safer for the dog to have it connected to a harness versus a collar.  With retractable leashes if the dog runs and comes to the end of the length or if the brake is suddenly applied then the dog can be abruptly pulled back.Overall this is a great leash.  I have used Flexi retractable leashes in the past both rope and tape versions and I can say that this one compares nicely.

"This is a review for the 75ft 200LED Amir Solar Powered LED String Light.  This device can be powered via both the included USB device or the included Solar Panel.  The USB device can be plugged into a wall charger, computer USB port and even a portal battery charger.  I tested powering it with both a RavPower portable battery charger and the solar panel and both instances would just as good.  The solar panel does have an internal 1800mAh Ni-MH battery.  When testing the light with the solar panel the brightness level of the LEDs was lower due to the internal batteries lack of current charge.I see application of the solar panel more towards if you want the lights to turn on and off automatically via the light sensor.  There is a on / off button at the back of the solar panel if you wish to turn the lights off for an extend period of time.  The solar panel can either be mounted on the wall or put in the ground via the included ground stake.  If mounted on the wall depending on the height it may prove harder to turn the lights on and off permanently.  The USB device to power the lights is a nice touch.  When using the USB device the lights would have to be turned on and off manually.  There are two settings: flash and steady lightning.  The design of the USB device to power the lights allows for the lights to be more portable if needed as well as being able to use the lights for a more extended period of time.There is enough wire between the solar panel / USB device and the first light to allow adequate space in-between both items.  Inside the connector plug is a rubber gasket to keep out water and a screw top cover to aid in further weatherproofing the connection.  Setup is straightforward and should only take a couple of minutes.  The time it will take to string the lights is a different story.Overall, this is a great product that comes with everything that would be needed for installation.  It is a great way to add low to no cost lighting to a porch, window, gazebo, etc.  I love solar products due to their low overall cost and environmental friendliness, this one is great and you will not be disappointed.

"This is a review for the Amir Solar Spotlight with Wire.  The solar Spotlight can be used in two different applications, either mounted on the wall or staked in the ground.  The solar panel and light are two different pieces that have their own mounting brackets and ground stakes, this allows for better placement of the solar panel to get the most sunlight.  Mounting hardware for both applications is included.  The Solar Spotlight has two brightness levels with advertised runtime of 8 hours on high brightness and 14 hours on low brightness.  There is an on / off button on the back of the solar panel that is used to turn on / off the light and change the brightness level.  The solar panel has a light sensor so when it is detected that it is starting to get dark the light will activate.  The solar panel contains a replaceable 18650 3.7v 2200mAh rechargeable Ni-MH battery that is advertised to last at least 8 to 12 months possibly longer. After time rechargeable batteries start getting weaker so this lifetime estimate is not surprising.  There is also a connector to connect the solar panel and light wires together; inside the plug is a rubber gasket to keep out water and a screw top cover to aid in further weatherproofing the connection.  Installation is straightforward and should only take a couple of minutes.One thing I disliked didnt have anything to do with the solar light itself but with the packaging it came in.  The solar light is packaged in Styrofoam, when Styrofoam breaks into pieces it is a pain to clean up so I would rather avoid Styrofoam.Overall, this is a great product that comes with everything that would be needed for installation.  It is a great way to add low to no cost lighting to the yard or any other area.  I love solar products due to their low overall cost and environmental friendliness, this one is great and you will not be disappointed.

"This is a review for the Amzdeal 7.7 inch Round Chrome-plated ABS Wall / Ceiling-mounted shower head.  For my application I am using this as a rain fall shower head as this is how my bathroom is currently setup.  The shower head is made of ABS plastic with a Crome finish which makes it lightweight for its size as well as giving it an elegant look.  My previous showerhead started showing rust spots so I wanted to have it replaced.  The face of the shower head is extra wide and outputs a wide stream of water.  The shower nubbins are soft flexible rubber tips that are flexible enough to clean out calcium or lime build-up yet stiff enough to keep the individual stream of water in the correct direction and flowing nicely.  Inside the screw joint there is a rubber gasket as well as a built-in strainer.  The connector is a G1/2 IPS connection which should fit standard plumbing connections.  Installation is a breeze and no tools are needed other than a chair or step ladder depending on how high this is getting installed.Overall, this is a great shower head that puts out a large volume of water while providing a gentle rain flow touch without sacrificing on water pressure.  The shower head has a beautiful classic high quality look to it and I couldnt be more pleased.  I purchased this item at a discounted rate for review purposes. The review is my own and unbiased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FPVST43I0EMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01080JODU#wasThisHelpful","R2FPVST43I0EMC","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Aukey Sports Bluetooth 4.1 Headset, model EP-B13, are not the typically designed Bluetooth headsets. The ear hook on this headset is part of the earbud versus an attachable piece. The ear hook also helps in directing the direction of the wire behind the neck and relieving some of the weight off of the inner ear from the earbuds. The headset is also really lightweight and comes with 2 pair of different sized replaceable earbuds to help in getting a comfortable fit.The sound quality of the headsets is great. There is distortion at full volume but that can be expected. At normal volumes the sound is crisp and clean. The headset also has a built-in Mic for hands free calling that allows for clear communication with the other party. The headset has CVC noise cancellation technology which I believe helps in this regard. The headset is advertised as sweat-proof, only time will tell but so far this is proving to be true. The headset offers roughly 8 hours of active use and 160 hours of standby and roughly 2 hours to fully charge. A nice feature is that the battery level is also displayed on IOS devices, worked on my iPhone 4s.Overall, the headset works great and I am fond of the design of the headset. Sound quality is great, quality is great and the headset has a nice clean design.I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V20OLJF062P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPH66IK#wasThisHelpful","R1V20OLJF062P","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Homdox BBQ Grill Brush is a really great heavy duty BBQ grill brush.  It is a really nice design that makes cleaning the grill much easier.  The brush bristles are made of stainless steel that do not bend out of shape as well as being able to get to all sides of the grate.  The bristles are still pointy and not matted down after rigorous use.  The design of the bristles allows for cleaning not only the top but the sides as well.  It is advertised as three brushes in one and it is quick to see why.  The three brush design makes cleaning the grill easier and faster due to the surface area the brush head and bristles are able to cover at once.  The handle and arm of the brush is tough and 18 inches long as well.  The length makes it easy to reach the back of the grate and if you clean the grill with the heat on, long enough to keep your hands from getting burnt.  The end of the handle also has a loop to make it easy for hanging while not in use.  I do prefer the black plastic handle versus wooden handles.  I find that the wooden handles end up getting dirty really quickly.Overall, this is a great sturdy BBQ grill brush and by far the best one I have used.  My old single head grill brush is now getting tossed and this one is replacing it.  Big improvement over the typical grill brushes. Highly recommend this brush based on quality, performance, and construction. Excellent product and would be great as a gift.  I received a sample of this product for review purposes.  All opinions stated are that of my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CV5657BJ7226/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QXH3U2#wasThisHelpful","R3CV5657BJ7226","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had a couple of USB wall chargers, some OEM that came with the device I purchased and some aftermarket purchases due to devices I purchased not having wall chargers included. From the various wall chargers that I have gone through I have learned that I like certain things included:1) Multiple ports, multiple port wall chargers allow the ability to charge more devices at once as well carry one less charger when traveling. Not to mention in an airport it means looking for one available outlet versus two or more.2) Enough amperage to at least charge two tablets at once. Enough amperage means the devices can charge at normal speeds.3) Smart featured ports, meaning the USB port is able to detect the correct amperage to output for your device. Now a days newer chargers have this feature. If the charger you are looking at doesnt have this feature move on to another one that does.4) Foldable wall plug, having a foldable plug is great for traveling and means easier packing and comfortability if it is in your pocket.5) CompactThe Anker PowerPort 4 (40W 4-Port USB Wall Charger) has everything I look for in a wall charger and more.  For one it is a 4 port wall charger versus two which makes it great for travel and for home use.  The wall charger is 40W which is enough to charge multiple tablets at full speed at the same time. But the notable difference with this wall charger compared to the many others I have gone through is that this one has Anker Voltage Boost technology, which means it can safely charge a device at faster speeds than normal, major plus for when charging my Samsung Tab and iPad. Not to mention it is also dual voltage, 110v/220v, a must for overseas travel.The wall charger is also compact, lightweight and has a foldable wall plug. Another nice thing about this wall charger is that it has smart USB ports meaning it can output 1A when an iPhone is plugged in or 2.4A when a Samsung Tab is plugged in regardless of which USB port. This wall charger also has LED lights but they arent overly bright and annoying.  Having bright LEDs is sometimes a distraction when trying to sleep if this is used in the bedroom.Overall, I am really happy with this wall charger. It works as advertised, has some value added features and is nicely priced.

"This is a review for the Mpow Shark Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Headset Headphone. To me the most important things about a headset are comfortability and sound quality. The Mpow Shark passes with flying colors on both these aspects. Comfortability is important due to the number of hours that the device will be worn. If it makes the ear sore, is to heavy or just plain uncomfortable than it wont be used. Sound quality is just as important due to it being the main functionality that this device provides. The device itself has a nice modern look to it with a glossy black surface. The Shark comes with different sized ear hooks and earbuds which helps with the comfortability aspect and fit for the headset. This headset can also be paired with multiple phones which is great if you typically switch between multiple phones. Sound quality on both ends of the conversation was normal. I didnt have any issues hearing the other end nor them me. Operation of the headset is typical for Bluetooth headsets and it has the ability to change volume, play or pause, answer or end a call, re-dial and mute. Synching was just as straightforward and easy.Overall, I really like the look, design, comfort and sound quality is great.

"I love the features and design of TaoTronics TT-DL12 LED Desk Lamp. Its a modern stylish lamp, the type of lamp that I picture being on drafting tables. The lamp is constructed of aluminum and plastic.  Every part of the lamp that you would want to be adjustable is.  The lamp head rotates and both arms rotate as well.  The lamp is pretty heavy, due to the base.  It is designed this way in order to ensure that the lamp does not tip over due to the various options of positioning the lamp head.Since this is an LED lamp it has all the benefits that come with LED: less power, longer lasting and less eye strain.  Unlike other Taotronics lamps this one is not touch activated.  On the head of the lamp is an off / on switch.  The lamp is powered by a DC 12.5V/0.48A wall adapter that plugs into the cable at the base of the lamp.  The lamp is 6W and a temperature of 5500K, which makes it a cool white.  Since this is an LED lamp the lifespan of the bulbs are rated at 50,000 hours, meaning you will never have to replace them.Overall, this is a great lamp and nothing about it is disappointing. Its LED, has a great contemporary modern look to it and takes up minimal space.  This is great for a study table or college student.

"This is a review for the Esky ES-PS01 110lb/50kg Backlit LCD Display Electronic Balance Scale.  The scale runs on 2 AAA batteries which are included.  It has a pull out tape measure that can be used to check the dimensions of a bag or box as well as a hook to hold an item in the air to get the weight.  The handled extends up and provides adequate room for a comfortable grip.  On the back of the scale is a spot for storing the hook and keeping it out of the way.  The handle compacts down as well for easy storage.  The scale is works out great for traveling.  It provides an easy method for weighing a bag to make sure it is under the baggage weight limit for an airplane.  The scale also is lightweight and doesnt add much extra weight to existing baggage if used for travel.  The scale is able to measure up to 110 pounds and can display the weight in grams, kilo grams, pounds or ounces.  Although I use this for weighing my bags for traveling it also easily fits into other applications such as weighing fish, food, etc.Overall, I am quite happy with this scale.

"This is a really great barbecue tool set.  Included are a spatula, tongs and a grill fork.  The set also comes in a nice box that makes it great for a present such as for fathers day.  All items are made of heavy duty stainless steel and are extremely durable.  Each item is roughly 16 inches long making them great for keeping your hands out of the heat while still being able to reach the back of the grill.  They also have loops on the end for hanging and easy storage.  The tools have some really nice features on them.Grill Fork: Well-built and sharp, no issues with picking up a heavy piece of meat with these.Tongs: Great oversized tongs.  The tongs have 6 teeth on one end and a flat end on the other that make grabbing and turning hot dogs and sausages an easy.  The tongs also have a metal loop that can be used for keeping the tongs shut when in storage.Spatula:  This item I love the most.  It actually has a bottle opener built into it at the top of the flat end.  On one side of the spatula is a serrated edge that is great for cutting into meat while on the other side is a flat end with saw teeth.  The front of the spatula is a contoured tip that is great for getting under meat easier.  The oversized face of the spatula makes it easy to flip burgers or steaks.Overall, I am really happy with this set.  There is nothing flimsy or cheap about it.  These are definitely comparable to high end barbecue sets in terms of quality and features.  I recommend this product and can honestly see this barbecue set lasting a long time.

"The Amir Charging stand for Apple Watch and iPhone is a great stand for the iPhone and Apple Watch.  If you dont have an Apple Watch this stand can still be used for a conventional watch as well.  This stand is a great way to store your phone and watch till the next morning.  The stand is well constructed of Aluminum with soft padding to keep your phone and watch from getting scratched up.  It provides a perfect viewing angle for using your iPhone while on the night stand as well.  At the back of the stand is cutout for routing cables to the phone and watch.  There is also a cutout for placing the Apple Watch charging puck into the stand.  The stand can hold the iPhone both vertically or horizontally.  I love the sleek, modern design of the stand. It looks great on my nightstand and compliments the devices nicely.Overall this is a great product and I have no qualms about recommending it to anyone looking for a stand for their devices.

"I just got the Amir Solar Powered Flag Pole Light.  The light is solar powered and has 24 super bright LEDs that last up to 100,000 hours.  The internal batteries are charged in the morning by the 11 solar panels on top of the light.  The light has a built-in light sensor which turns on the light at dusk and shuts it off in the morning.  The light easily lasts the whole night without issue.  Installation is easy and no maintenance is required after installation.  If you do need an extension for your flagpole for installation one can be gotten at Ace Hardware for a couple bucks.Overall, this solar flag pole light is a great idea and works great.  It is super easy to install and looks great at night.  It is a much more cost effective and easier setup than running wired lighting.  Great product, recommended.

"I actually needed a food thermometer and this one has been working better than I could have imaged, definitely much better than the traditional manual thermometers.  One feature of this thermometer that I love the most is the hold button.  Its a great feature for being able to take the temperature of meats in the oven, press the hold button and then safely read the temperature.  I also love that it is digital and has an auto on / off.  Moving the stainless steel probe will turn the thermometer on or off depending on the position of the probe.  Since the thermometer is digital it does require one AAA battery, not included.  The thermometer also has an auto shut off after 10 mins which helps safe on battery life.  The response time on this thermometer is super fast as well, roughly 4 to 6 seconds to get a reading.  The Temperature Reading Range is between -58 to 572-50~300).  Changing the temperature reading between Fahrenheit or Celsius is easy with the press of a button.Overall, I have to say digital thermometers are the way to go.  Im now a fan.

"I ended up getting the Moonmini Stylish Ultra-thin Frosted Translucent PC Hard Case Cover Shell Skin Protector for 13 inch Apple MacBook Air - Sky Blue.  I wanted something that provided a little more protection to my MacBook.  The case is easy to install and remove.  There are vents on the bottom of the case to ensure that there is adequate air flow as well as 4 rubber feet.  The case is Sky Blue all around.  This one does not have any design aspects although Moonmimi does have some really nice cases that do have really nice designs on them already.  This case itself is great if you want something basic and low cost to protect your computer.  It is also great if you wish to use a sharpie to put designs on it yourself or even sticker it up.  It would be better to put these on a case versus the MacBook itself as it allows for easier removal and you can always get a new case to start over with self designs.Overall, this case is perfect for giving the MacBook some extra protection.

"This Selfie Stick from Amzdeal is a great compact selfie stick that works great.  It has a nice feel to it and is weighs roughly 6 ounces.  Compact it is roughly 8 inches long while as fully extended it is roughly 32 inches long when fully extended.  There is a U shaped clamp at the end of the stick that is used for gripping your phone. The top and bottom of the clamp there is a rubber cushion to keep your phone secure and from getting damaged. The clamp is spring loaded.  The selfie stick has a built-in rechargeable battery that lasts roughly 40 hours in operation and 96 hours on standby.Inner Clamp Measurements: from 2.25 in to 3in(If your phone has a case make sure to include that in the measurements. Below are the measurements of some phones without cases, this is to give an idea if your phone will fit within the clamps.)Phone Width Measurements:iPhone 6 Plus - 3.06inIPhone 6 - 2.64iniPhone5S - 2.31iniPhone 5C - 2.33inSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge - 2.76inSamsung Galaxy S6 - 2.78inSamsung Galaxy S4 - 2.74inThe U shaped clamp has 180 degrees of motion.  This makes it easier to get the angle of a shot that you want with the Selfie Stick. There is a handle on the side of the clamp to tighten the tension of the clamp in moving forwards and backwards. The U-clamp does not rotate from landscape to portrait mode. If you wish to take a picture in portrait mode though you can just rotate the selfie stick as a whole, which works just as good and in my opinion is a lot less work and quicker then making adjustments with the clamp.This is a Bluetooth Selfie Stick and pairing is straightforward and easy.  No issues were encountered pairing the stick with my iPhone 4s.  The operation button is perfectly placed on the end of the handle.  This button is used to power on the stick, pair the stick as well as take the picture. At the bottom of the stick is the micro USB charging port (cable included) and screw connector for attaching a carbineer hook or wristlet.Overall, I am quick pleased with this selfie stick. It works great, easy to use, compact enough to easily carry in a purse or bag and is a great design.I was provided a sample product for testing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YW1CXPW732C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V658Z7I#wasThisHelpful","R39YW1CXPW732C","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a multi-functional device that acts as a MP3 player, SD Card Reader, USB Flash Drive Reader and FM Transmitter.  Music can be played via the device to your car speakers from a 3.5mm connection, SD card or USB Flash drive.  There is a USB plug on the device that can be used to read a USB flash drive to access music as well as charge or power a device at 1A output.  The device then uses the built-in FM transmitter to relay the music to your car speakers.  No issues with static or noise from the FM transmitter and there are enough channel selections available to allow for crisp clean sound without interference.  The device also comes with a remote control for easier control.  There is an LCD screen on the device as well that makes it easier to sort through and play music. The device is able to read SD cards or USB flash drives with a capacity up to 32 GB.  I tried an 8 GB flash drive and had no issues with capability.Overall, this is a great device that acts as an extension to your car stereo and gives it the ability to play music from different formats.

"The Aukey TripLink WD-N1 is a great all in one device.  It is a portable wireless router, NAS with media streaming capability, SD reader / writer and a 3000 mAh portable battery pack.In my opinion the best feature of the WD-N1 is the ability for it to function as a NAS.  You can plug in a hard drive either desktop or portable, a flash drive or a SD card and be able to share it wirelessly to your Android or Apple devices.  Instead of transferring movies or music to your device you can access them wirelessly via the WD-N1.  This allows for increased storage for your device as well as instant access, no more having to copy them to your actually device to access files.  There is a free Android and Apple App that allows for easier management and access of the WD-N1.Other Notable Features:- Compatible with Android and IOS devices- Ability to read portable hard drives, flash drives and micro SD cards and act as a portable NAS. I have used flash drives from 2GB to 32GB, various sized SD cards and a 2 TB Western digital portable hard drive all without issues.- Ability to transfer files between connected devices via the WD-N1- Ability to be connected to the WD-N1 and still browse the internet- 3000 mAh portable battery to recharge devices or power a portable hard drive.- No lag when accessing media from the WD-N1 as well as the ability for to stream files to multiple devices at onceSome things to be aware of:- Does not come with a wall charger although a USB charging cable is included and any USB wall charger should work to power or recharge the WD-N1.Overall, this is a great device to have. Not only is it a portable battery pack which is really convenient in itself it also gives you the ability to access storage on the go. This product is so versatile and has so much functionality that this review just barely touches on it. You really have to try it out to really appreciate it. This device is really great to have on long trips or at home to share media easier between devices.I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.If my review found helpful I appreciate clicking the ""Yes"" link below.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NNFCFR3MDGR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNEFFSS#wasThisHelpful","R2NNFCFR3MDGR7","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for the Amzdeal Chrome-polished Brass Thermostatic Throttle Valve for Touchless Temperature Sensor Faucet/ Hot Cold Water Mixing Valve.  If you have a touchless facet and do not have a mixing value built-in to the facet then this would be needed in order to set the water temperature.  Some touchless facets include a mixing value in the body of the faucet while as some do not.The mixing value allows the ability to change the mix of cold and hot water by turning the value right or left 1/3 of a turn.  The value can be set on all cold, all hot or in between.  This value is not just for touchless facets and has other uses as well.  It would act as a great safety feature for kids to prevent them from setting the water too hot on the facet.  Although, the value is made for sink water supply hoses so it wont work in an application for a washing machine.  The value does have backflow preventers for both inlets. The mixing value is really easy to install and shouldnt take more than an hour for a completed install. Once installed just set the water temperature on the value and all set.  The mixing value has been working out great thus far.Package Includes:- Temperature Mixing Valve- Rubber Gaskets- Supply lines are not includedSpecification:- Control: Cold, Open, Hot or Off- Inlet: RED: hot -  in, BLUE: cold -  in- Outlet: Composition  in- Solid brass construction- Very easy to installI was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.If my review found helpful I appreciate clicking the ""Yes"" link below.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GGZ1S02REQM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZR3H6Z2#wasThisHelpful","R1GGZ1S02REQM6","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for the TaoTronic TT-BZ001 Insect Bug Zapper. The item comes in a cardboard box and is securely packed inside. The bug zapper comes pre-assembled and can be used straight out of the box. The design is typical for a bug zapper. The housing is mostly made of aluminum but has black plastic sides. The bottom has a slide out tray that is easily removable for cleaning. The metal grates on the bug zapper can be removed as well and the bulbs are also replaceable. Although, the bulbs are rated for 8000 hours of operation so they should last quite a while. Included with the bug zapper is a metal chain that can be used for hanging the bug zapper on a hook, it can be mounted as well on the wall or just placed on a table. If mounting or hanging the bug zapper an extension cord maybe required. The power cord for the bug zapper is roughly 3 feet long which can pose an issue if the outlet is at ground level.What's in the box.TaoTronic Insect Bug ZapperHanging ChainWall mount attachment and 2 screwsCleaning brushOverall, I am quite happy with the bug zapper. It is better alternative than using fly traps and sprays. It is a slim design bug zapper, lightweight and doesnt take up much space at all. This bug zapper is also quiet and doesnt make the buzzing sound when turned on. Great item for a more bug free summer.I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.If my review found helpful I appreciate clicking the ""Yes"" link below.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GS24GR2EZXSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XU3X4FM#wasThisHelpful","R2GS24GR2EZXSV","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Bluetooth earbuds for exercising. I got the Mpow Swift Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Sport Headphones in Green. Part of the earbud is green and the wire is green as well. I feel that the green helps with standing out a little bit more when running outside.The earphones feature Bluetooth 4.0 technology and last roughly five hours per charge. The microphone is built into the earphone versus being midway on the cord. This design doesn't add extra weight to just one side of the cord and doesn't pull the earphone from the ear when running. The earphones come with multiple sized ear hooks and ear buds which ensure the ability to get a snug and comfortable fit. Pairing is easy and straightforward.So far these have been working out great. I haven't had any issues from sweat shorting out the earphones. They are actually advertised as being sweetproof. Sound quality is great; these actually get pretty loud with my iPhone 4s. Even though microphone placement is on the actual earbud it hasn't had an impact on the opposite end being able to hear me clearly. These are super lightweight and have a flat cord versus a rounded one; you dont even notice that the cord is behind your neck. It does take some time to get use to the controls as they are on the earbud itself. The controls are on the headset are for answering a call, ending a call, declining a call, redialing, mute and playing music. The headset can also be paired to two phones at the same time.

"This is definitely not a cheaply made armband for the iPhone. I have gone through a couple of different arm bands, and this one is one of the ones Im most impressed with the most. Armbands are great when working out, unless youre using Bluetooth headsets having an armband is the next best thing. It keeps your iPhone secure as well as a key (gym key, car key or house key). Yes, the armband has a slot to secure your key as well.The armband is a really nice and I love the feel of it. The iPhone 6 (4.7in version) fits perfectly although if you have a really big case then you may run into issues. I tried this also with my iPhone 4s and it fit as well, although the iPhone 4s is smaller so wasn't expecting any issues there. The arm band has some really nice built-in features that you do not always find on arm bands such as a key holder as well as being reflective. The reflective material is around the boarder of the screen cover as well as on the armband. The clear plastic screen cover keeps the iPhone from getting wet and keeps it secure in the arm band. I have a tempered glass screen protector on my phone and didn't have any issue with responsiveness of my iPhone. The rest of the armband is made up of a soft leather like material with a neoprene wrap and Velcro band. There are two different slots for band which allows for a more snug and secure fit. Not to mention an additional extension strap is included if needed. The feel of the armband around the arm is comfortable and the material works well for staying dry. The armband is also really lightweight and not stiff at all.

"Unless you have an AUX port in your car or a Bluetooth enabled car trying to play music from your mobile phone, iPad or iPod to your car speakers isn't possible.  Well not possible without the use of a car adapter or an FM Transmitter such as the MPOW Streambot OVAL FM Transmitter.The FM Transmitter is easier to use then trying to setup Bluetooth.  On the FM transmitter is a 3.5mm cable that you plug into the audio jack on your device.  Synch up the FM station your stereo with the FM Station on the transmitter and that's it.  The FM transmitter has a connected car charger that has a 2.1A USB port that can be used to charge your actual device, tablet or other device.The FM transmitter has enough stations to choose from to ensure that interference does not occur.  I have had previous experiences with FM transmitters that sometimes there is a buzzing sound on the speakers.  Do not notice the same issue with this transmitter.  This FM transmitter is also able to provide hands-free conversations via the car speakers although I haven't tried this out as I'm using my old iPod with the FM transmitter.Overall, great FM transmitter.  The sound quality is great, easy to use, no interference as well as the ability for hands-free calling.I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDWXOZYGZSN7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJDPMEO#wasThisHelpful","RDWXOZYGZSN7D","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great find.  Typically for the cost of the 5-Pack Micro USB RAVPower Cables you would only be getting a single cable. This item is 5 different sized Micro USB to USB cables.

The gauge of the cable is similar to the gauge of cables on wired mice.  I tried out all the cables and all the connections fit nicely.

"The RAVPower Lightning to USB 3ft cable is the first lightning cable I have used that is constructed with PTFE.  I actually had to look up PTFE to figure out what it was.  PTFE is better known as Teflon.  The other things great about this cable are the thicker and sturdier cable joints, shielding, and the 5000+ bend-test.  This is important as cables tend to have issues at the cable joints.  My older lightning cable actually had that issue and you could see the colored wires, of course this one replaced it.  On the shielding, I know with CAT5 (Ethernet Cabling) shielding does help with interference.  I am assuming the shielding in this lightning cable provides the same benefit.  With all these enhancements that cable is still flexible which is great. I do not like stiff cables as it makes it hard for cable management.  The cable is also 3ft long which makes it a perfect length for use with power banks.  Im using my cable with my iPhone 5c and it has been working great no issues as of yet.  Charging and synching work as it should, it is Apple MFI certified which ensures compatibility.  If you are looking for an aftermarket cable it is best to stick with the Apple MFI certified cables.Overall, I am happy with this cable. I like the enhancements that RAVPower has made to the cable and expect it to last a long time compared to past Apple and aftermarket lightning cables.  If any issues arise I will be sure to update this review and the rating. But so far so good so 5 stars as the cable works as advertised.I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LEQVJOSKNP4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFKOU56#wasThisHelpful","R3LEQVJOSKNP4Q","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The things that I like about the Anker PowerCore 13000 is that it can put out a max of 4 Amps combined between the two USB ports. If you are charging a phone and tablet this is more then enough. If you are charging two tablets they will charge a little slower then using the OEM charger. Tablets tend to charge in a range of 2.1A to 2.4A depending on the brand while phones typically at 1A. The capacity of the power bank is more than enough to fully recharge the typical phone and tablet. This device has PowerIQ and VoltageBoost built-in. You will not find these technologies on all power banks so I would confirm first. PowerIQ combined with VoltageBoost allows for your device to recharge quicker then it normally would. VoltageBoost is great to have when you are trying to recharge a tablet since they tend to have larger capacity batteries then phones and take longer to recharge. VoltageBoost seems like a fairly new technology to power banks so not all offer it. I have just started seeing the newer power banks coming out offering this kind of technology.Overall, this is a great power bank for the money. It has a matte finish so it helps in gripping, comes with a carrying case and USB cable to recharge the device (you do need your own wall charger), compact for the capacity and from a manufacturer who has past experience with power banks.I was supplied a sample for testing purposes and I promise my review is completely honest and fair.

"The air vent mount is an alternative to the suction dash mount. Both designs can have their downfalls and advantages. Its all more of a preference of at what angle, height and distance you prefer your phone to be at and what will best fit the design of the vehicle.The Xenomix Air Vent Car Phone Mount Holder Cradle model HD-C8 is a nicely designed product. It is a straightforward design that counts down on extra weight of the mount.  Since this mount attaches to the air vent of the vehicle you don't want a mount that is pretty lightweight, which this one is.Before purchasing an air vent mount I would suggest looking at the air vents in your car first. For instance, the air vents in my Toyota Truck are slanted and not overly loose. With slanted meaning that the bottom of the air vent is closer to me and the top father away. This design helps the air vents to stay in place. Air vents that are overly loose or designed flat may not be such a good fit for an air vent mount as the weight may cause the air vents to move down affecting the mount.  Although, the best test to see if your vehicle is compatible with an air vent is trying it out.The Xenomix air vent works by utilizing a clamp that grasps onto one of the fins in the air vent in your car. The clamp opens up roughly 4.5 inches wide.  If your phone is more then 4.5 inches wide then it will not fit. It has a ball joint that allows for 360 degree operation allowing for either landscape or portrait view on your phone. There are rubber cushions on the arms that clamp around the phone will in the mount which provide against damaging your phone. Installation of the mount is as simple as it can get and is straightforward.  The design is also a simplistic one but very functional.  This is not one of your bulky vents that is an eye sore.Overall, how well this vent mount works will depend wholly on the design of the vents in your car. My experience with the vent was problem free and this type of mount design is an alternative to the dash mount.  I do like this mount more then the previous ones I have tried as it allows for placement on the left side or right side of the steering wheel, air vents are typically  in these locations.  It is also not bulky and doesn't take up much space or restrict air flow from the vent.I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L9HS7RQGRJ4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU9LWQK#wasThisHelpful","R3L9HS7RQGRJ4K","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for the Ancheer AN-SH002 4-setting handheld shower head and the shower head holder.  Installation is easy of both is straightforward and easy.  Just screw the old showerhead, screw on the shower head holder (use Teflon tape), connect the end of your stainless steel or plastic shower hose to the end of the shower head.  If you would like you can use Teflon tape on all the connections for a more leak free connection.  Make sure not to over tighten the connection as this can warp the gasket inside of the shower hose.  For my setup I have a stainless steel shower hose installed with this shower head.  Both the hose and shower head are silver so they pair nicely together.  This mount allows for having both a fixed and handheld showerhead.To change the shower head setting, all that is needed is turning the head until you hear a click.  The 4 settings are marked to easily identify which one you are on. Each setting worked nicely and neither of them restricted water follow in any way.  None of the shower settings feels like being pelted by needles, which is a major plus.  One of the pictures of the item gives a good depiction of the different settings.Overall, I do like this shower head.  It does work better then the one that it replaced and does not leak at all.  The settings are nice and it is pleasant to have a change when showering.  Also it comes with a reusable eco-bag that can be used for groceries, etc.I was provided a sample product for testing and review purposes","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GCHIMNXYZU2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YUCW6T2#wasThisHelpful","R2GCHIMNXYZU2U","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for the Ancheer 2 meter (6 foot) stainless steel shower hose. Installation is easy and straightforward. Both ends of the hose have rubber gaskets to prevent leaks. When installing mine I used some plumbing tape for the connections. This is a force of habit and from the look of the connectors you may be able to get away with not using the plumbing tape. Although, be sure to not over tighten the connectors as this can squash the internal gasket and create the potential for leaks. The end connectors are metal and not made of plastic. The hose is great and doesn't restrict water pressure, water pressure is actually quite adequate. I have had some hoses that had a thinner inside diameter for the hose which affected water pressure.This is a stainless steel hose so it doesn't have the same downsides of plastic hoses. The stainless steel hose does have weight to it compared to plastic hoses. It is not flimsy at all and is pretty flexible. It hangs straight down and I have yet to experience issues with kinks. I have experienced other stainless steel hoses show specks of rust on the hose itself but have not noticed that issue with this hose. Currently it is priced at $9.99 which is inline with the cost of comparable hoses and a little bit lower in price than others.Overall, I have no complaints. The shower hose works as advertised, looks great and I expect it to last quite a while.I was provided a sample product for review purpose and the review is my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWPV9XH3HT0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YULD2XC#wasThisHelpful","R2GWPV9XH3HT0X","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Selfie sticks have been around for quite some time now.  You have probably seen people out and around tourist spots using them.  Selfie sticks are convenient especially if you want to be in the picture you are taking and have actually have more then just you head show up in the picture.  They are easy to use and pretty lightweight.The design of the selfie stick has stayed pretty constant while mobile phones have been adding more feature rich camera options.  This selfie stick has been updated and has all the functions of the older versions and more.  Namely the ability to zoom in and out and switch between the back and front cameras.  This selfie stick also has one more very differing feature.  Instead of using Bluetooth or a cable for the selfie stick and the mobile phone to communicate, this one uses some sort of ultrasonic control.  The selfie stick paired with the FREE IOS or Android App allows you to easily take pictures.The selfie sticks arm is extendable up to 39 inches, which is more than enough. When the selfie stick is collapsed it is 9.25 inches long.  I have used the selfie stick with my iPhone 4s only so far and it has been working great.  The zoom buttons on the stick come in handy and it is super easy to setup and use.  When the phone is in the holder it seems secure, not like it will be falling out or at all loose. The holder for the phone has soft rubber grips that use springs to keep tension on the phone while in the holder. The handle of the stick as well has a different design then the typical black cylinderal shape of other selfie sticks. The selfie stick comes with a hand strap that is attachable to the bottom of the stick if you wish to use it.  A mirror is also included and it's installation is optional.  The purpose of the mirror is so that you can use the front camera of your mobile phone versus just the back to take pictures. I prefer using the mobile phone screen versus the included mirror but that is just my preference.The selfie stick has an internal rechargeable battery that can be charged by the included micro USB cable. A USB wall adapter is not included but any USB wall adapter can be used as well as the USB ports on your computer to recharge the stick. Charging is pretty fast and takes roughly under 30 minutes.Overall, I am quite happy with the selfie stick. It has been holding up well and is small and lightweight making it great for travel and actually being in the photos.  The zoom features in itself make this selfie stick worth buying over others.I was supplied a sample review product for test and evaluation purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GW2RTTLA4RQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USSMBSS#wasThisHelpful","R1GW2RTTLA4RQZ","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From past experience stainless steel measuring spoons are a lot better purchase then plastic. Though not all stainless steel products are created equal. I have had in the past some items that were stainless steel, advertised not to rust, yet end up rusting. So far after a week of using these spoons, having them in the sink and in a humid environment they have not rusted. Where I live can be humid at times which doesnt help with preventing items from rusting.The design of these spoons is simple yet efficient. They are a set of 5 (1 tbsp/15 ml, 1/2 tbsp/7.5 ml, 1 tsp/5 ml, 1/2 tsp/2.5 ml and 1/4 tsp/1.25 ml). On the front arm of the spoon is the measurement in TSP and ML, so no calculations needed for conversion. The end of the spoon is round and allows for easy measurements. The arm of the spoon is also long enough to fit in deep jars without any trouble. The spoons come with a snap ring which makes it easy to add and remove a spoon to the bunch without any hassle. The snap ring helps prevent misplacing a spoon. Since these are stainless steel they are easy to clean and dont get stained like plastic measuring spoons some time do.Needless to say, I am very happy with this measuring set. If you are looking for some stainless steel measuring spoons that are nicely priced and thoughtfully designed these maybe for you.I was provided a sample product for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZTH87FAYDHYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IE2J0SO#wasThisHelpful","R2ZTH87FAYDHYE","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Anker PowerPort 10 Multi-Port USB Charger is a great replacement to the single USB chargers. It has 10 USB Charging ports that should more than meet the needs of any power hungry device. All 10 ports have power and voltage boost as well as Smart IQ capability. What this means is faster charging for your devices. The device is 60w with the USB ports being able to charge up to 2.4A per port. This means that this device is able to charge portable speakers, iPhones, iPads, Samsung Tablets, and more all at the same time. There is no need to look at the USB ports on the device to find out whether the port outputs 1A, 2.1A or 2.4A. Any port can be used and the device itself will determine the correct output for your device.  This is a lot more user friendly and convenient than having a USB charger that has a port that is only able to output a specific amperage versus being versatile like the Anker PowerPort device.The device is also super compact for having 10 USB ports.  I have seen and had USB chargers that have less ports and are more bulkier than this one. In fact 10 ports is probably overkill but having more ports available doesn't hurt anything. The device comes with a removable 5ft power cord. This is a typical power cord and not doesn't have a bulky power brick attached to it. This allows for easier cable management and a cleaner setup. A strip of Velcro is also included to aid in wrapping up the power cord. This device also has an off/on switch on the back of the device. I like this aspect a lot as I like having the ability to shut off the device if it's not being used. Using the on/off button is a lot easier then unplugging it from the power strip.  Not only USB chargers have this built-in convenience.I tested this charger with the iPhone 4s, iTouch, a portable battery pack, Bluetooth headset and Samsung Tablet with all charging without issues. I did notice that the devices recharged faster then normal. The device doesn't overheat and stays relatively cool while in use. It is also dual voltage, 110v/240v , which makes it perfect for traveling.Overall, I am impressed with this charger and will be replacing my current one with this one.  No issues to report.  It is a great economical USB charging station. It is a perfect alternative for replacing single port chargers and compatible with a multitude of USB devices.I was supplied a sample review product for test and evaluation purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G7J7JFAUYSEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YRYS4T4#wasThisHelpful","R1G7J7JFAUYSEY","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review for the OxyLED BL30 Bright Rechargeable LED Bike Light Set. This set includes the first USB chargeable batteries I have ever tried. I like that they have the USB connector port built-in and that all you have to do is plug them in to a wall adapter. I already have USB wall chargers in the house so it wasnt a big deal that a wall adapter is not included. The detachable front flashlight uses the USB rechargeable battery. There are two USB rechargeable batteries included so they can be easily swapped out when needed. An adapter for using three AAA batteries with the flashlight is also included if you wish to use those types of batteries instead. while The 2 rear tail lights use CR2032 batteries. CR2032 batteries arent expensive and can be purchased in any watch section of a store typically. The rear tail light is water sealed and has rubber washers to aid in keeping moisture out.I do like that the front light is removable and can be used as a standalone flashlight as well. The light is made of aluminum and wont get damaged beyond use if it is dropped or knocked around. I actually removed the included lanyard from the flashlight so its not in the way when the flashlight is mounted. Installation of the lights is super easy and removal of the front light once mounted easy as well. The bulbs on both the front and back lights are LED and are bright. Both front and rear lights have the option of high beam, low beam, strobe or off. The front light also has the option of adjusting the width of the beam to wide or narrow.I have no complaints at all and am actually quite impressed by the thoughtfulness of the design of the product. This must have been designed by an avid biker as everything that you could wish for is built-in to this product. Great find.I was provided a sample product for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EQRUXEUFMAG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWGH422#wasThisHelpful","R2EQRUXEUFMAG1","A14RPY0DV96EG4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14RPY0DV96EG4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this for my husband's shed.  We have a wood shed that is shaped like a barn, but the problem is there is no elecricity that runs out there.  So when we go out to the shed to get something, or if my husband is just needing to work out there on the mower, etc, he has no light.  Even during the daytime, the back of the shed, you still need light in it.This stick on motion sensor light was the perfect solution for our problem.  It comes with a sticky label type thing, that sticks to the back of the LED light and then to the wall or wherever you choose to put it.  It also comes with mounting brackets and screws, which is what we chose to do to put it up in our shed.  We applied it to the back wall on the shed, and now when he opens the door to the shed, the light shines on.  I was surprised at how well this lit up the shed.  The LED's on this night light are really bright.  I am kind of jealous now that I gave it to my husband for the shed, because I would love to have it in the house.  I may just have to purchase another one for me.  Great job by BYBlight on this.

"I own several pairs of headphones, and so I had high hopes for this set.  I do like that they are a certified product, as some of the headphones and devices that you get can let's just say be not safe for your phones.I don't like the way these fit in my ear they were very uncomfortable.  I would say that my ears are a normal size and I don't normally have any problems wearing headphones.  However, this set kept falling out.  I tried wearing them where they just kind of hung on my ear, but even then they were uncomfortable.  The sound quality on the set, I would say is ok.  Not fantastic, but a decent sound from them.  I will be gifting this set to my grandchildren.  They go through headphones quicker than most people go through socks.

"I am loving this wrap by Aircee!  I just started getting into scarves and wraps last year, so this year I am really adding to my collection.  I love the colors on this wrap.  I can wear this with just about anything in my wardrobe and it will compliment my outfit.The size of this wrap is perfect for using as a shawl for a nice cool Fall day, or on a colder day, wearing it as a scarf.  I wish I could describe to you the material on this shawl.  It is sooo soft!  I have ran it through the washer and dryer to see how it would launder.

"I have a new granddaughter on the way and I am super excited to be able to use these on her!  These come in a huge variety of colors, so it isn't going to matter what outfit we put her in, she will be all dolled up and ready to go.The headband part of these are super soft, and have a good stretch to them, so you can fit them on your baby with the baby still being comfortable.  My biggest issue with headbands on babies is when they are too small.  I have no worries with this set as I said the headband part has a good stretch to it.  The flower part of the headband is adorable.  I have made my own hair bows for my other grand daughters, so I know what to keep an eye out for on the flower part.  I can tell these are well made, when you pull the flower apart, you can't see where the seams are.  I am super happy with this set by QingHan and you can't beat the price on these!

" 1:02 MinsOh my goodness, these are so cute!  I know they say they are mainly for little girls, but these are so cute,  I can easily see me wearing one of them with the right outfit.The great thing about these is that you can wear them as a regular hair clip, or you can attach them to a headband and dress it up a little.  The hair clip themselves are made extremely well.  I have been making hair bows for my grand daughters for about a year now, and so I know what to look for.  When you pull the fabric on these back, you don't see any of the gathering on the inside.  That tells me that these are well made and that they are going to last.  My only issue with them, would be if my grand daughters lose them.  They have a beautiful crystal gems in the middle of the bow.  There is a big variety of colors to choose from, everything from a basic tan color to a bright pin or red.  I am very happy with these hair clips and think they are a great buy!

"These are perfect not only to wear by themselves, but I have been using them to put onto headbands.  I just buy the inexpensive headbands, and then clip one of the Satin Rolled Buds onto it,and I have an adorable headpiece for my grand daughters to wear.  They are both girly girls, and are thrilled with this collection by QuinHan.There is such a large variety of colors in this set.  I have a color to match just about every outfit they have.  The little rosettes are nice and tightly rolled.  I make hairbows myself, but this is one design that I personally wouldn't even attempt to do.  The back of the bows have a piece of felt that keeps the hair clip from slipping out of your hair.  One of my grand daughters has super fine hair, and we have a hard time keeping a hair clip in hers, but with this set, we haven't had any issues so far.  Great set and so versatile!!

"Over the years , I have started to become a little bit of a nut when it comes to scarves and shawls.  You can really add to an outfit, just by putting on the right scarf or by wearing a shawl.Having said all that, I have really begun to have a decent sized collection of scarves and shawls.  This one by Aircee does double duty, as both a shawl and a scarf!!  I can honestly say I only have one other scarf that doubles as a shawl, so I was really excited to get this one.  I chose the  Dark Blue/Beige color, and it goes with so many outfits.  This color is perfect to wear with a pair of bluejeans and my boots.  The shawl/scarf itself is the softest I have in my collection.  When I wear this, I tend to keep rubbing it against my cheek!

"I have a new grand daughter on the way, so I am super excited to get these headbands for baby girls.  I make hair bows for my other 2 grand daughters, and yet I have never mastered the ability to make a headband and have it comfortable for a baby's head.This set by HOVEOX has done a great job with this set.  They are super soft and absolutely adorable!  They have a little jewel in the middle of the flower, which I have pulled and pulled on to be sure it isn't going to come off.  I don't plan on allowing the new baby to put this in her mouth, but you can never be too sure when you are dealing with a baby, they tend to put things in their mouths quicker than you can see.  Having said that, I have to say that they passed the ""Nana"" test and I am not worried that they will be falling off easily.  The band that goes against the head is nice and soft.  You are getting 10 of these with a wide variety of colors, and the price point on these is better than any department store I have seen.

"This is the 2nd experience we have had with Gaffer tape in our household.  My husband is just as happy with this brand as the last brand that I got for him.Most recently, we used this tape for something that wouldn't be a typical use, but worked out extremely well for us  My friends rear view mirror on her car was broken, and she went to buy a new one, but they didn't have the exact size for the replacement.  Our solution:  Gaffer Tape!  We took and taped the heck out of the mirror and held it in place with Gaffer Tape.!  Yes it actually worked!  Not only did it work, but it held through the rain and on a 5 hour road trip.  That to me was the big test to us!

I know from personal experience that when you are making a bow, you have to be careful to get them tight, so that when you pull them apart, you can't see where the ""bottom"" of the bow is.

The weight on the foam is nice and sturdy feeling, well as sturdy as you can get with foam swords.The girls have had such fun with these, using their imagination.  The best thing to me about them is that it gets them away from the TV or the Tablets, and gets them using good old fashion pretend play.  They have been playing with these for over a week now, and have yet to do any damage to them.  I am here to tell you , that is a huge plus!!

"My husband has been wanting another bedside alarm clock, that he can actually see.  The thing that we love about this clock is that we can see it without our glasses.  Yes, we are at that wonderful age, where you have to grab your glasses to see just about anything.  The numbers on it are nice and large and easily read.I am always the one that has to battle with an alarm clock and try to figure out how to set the darn thing.  However, this one was super easy to set up and not only set the time, but to set the alarm was simple.  The buttons are nice and large.  I hate an alarm clock that has the tiny buttons that you are always hitting the one next to the one you are trying to use.  I didn't have that issue with this clock at all.  I also like that it runs on batteries, so I can set it on his side of the bed, even though we don't have an electrical outlet over there.  Now as far as the sound of the alarm, yes it gets us out of the bed!!  Phew, it is loud.  I am pretty sure this would even wake my teenager, which doesn't wake to anything!

" 2:28 MinsI have several sets of Bluetooth Headphones, yet this set by Liger, is absolutely going to become my new favorites.  I love the sound on them!!  I have to admit I am not an audio expert by any means, but I do know what I like to listen to and this set has fantastic sound to them.  I can listen to music and not turn them up near as loud as I do some of my other sets, and still have great sound.  The bass on them comes through clearer than any other headsets that I own.The earbuds themselves are super comfortable in my ear.  I have had other noise cancelling magnetic sets that are too heavy in my ear, but that wasn't the case with this set.  The cord on them is just the right length, with the controls on a bar on the cord.  The volume, etc is on the bar and it is easily accessible when you are wearing them.  Great set by Liger!!

"I own several styles of earbuds , but I have not seen a set like these by Maxrock.  The first thing that I noticed about them was the bright neon green color of them.  I personally like that feature, because when I go to put them in my purse, they stand out.  Most earbuds are black and they just blend in.The thing that is really unique about this set though is the earbud piece themselves.  They are super flexible and when I put them in my ear, I can barely tell they are there!  They are super comfortable and lightweight.  That is a huge selling point to me, because earbuds in general bug me. but I don't have that issue with these.  The cord on them is long enough that I can move around and I am not hindered by it.  I can slip my phone in my pocket and have plenty of room to have them in my ears.  The sound on them is pretty decent.  I am not a ""sound expert"" by any means, but I an tell you what I like and these sound great.  These are a good set of earbuds for the price point they have them at.  I would absolutely buy another pair for my kids who are always losing earbuds.

"I got these for my grand daughter who is always looking for something to do and is always telling me how bored she is.  She loves to jump rope and I am hear to tell you that these have been a big hit in our house!The handles on these are made with rubber and a soft type of grip to them ,which makes them easy to grasp.  When you are using them, they don't slip in your hands like some other sets that I have seen.  The rope itself rotates within the handles , so while you are jumping with them, it doesn't get all tangled up.  The rope is a little long for her, but that isn't really a big issue.  The handles and the rope are flexible enough that all she has to do is wrap them around her wrists until the rope is at the correct length and off she goes, jumping to her little hearts content.  Since she has started using these , she is talking about doing the "" Jump rope for Life"" that her school does each year.  Great set of ropes for any age.!

"I got this for my daughter who is about to have her first child and of course she is anxious about anything that you will put the baby in.  She has been looking at several different styles of these type of wraps and she is super happy with this one.I do want to say  that it is a little intimidating when you first look at it, but once you read through the little directions they give you, it is easy enough to figure out.  The material is super soft and feels strong, yet it stretches to be able to make it stay where you want it.  The price point this is listed at is great for these style of baby wraps!  When my kids were little, it was awful to put them in a carrier.  I got one and then refused to use it, because it was so difficult to figure out.

"I have a Boston Terrier and while she isn't a big dog, she is a cherished member of our family.  As a result, it is important to us that we have a leash that I can trust that we can take her outside with and she will be safe and not able to break free of it.I like the grip on it , as my hand fits nicely in it and it isn't too big.  A lot of this style leashes, the grips are too big for me and are uncomfortable to grip my hands around.  The leash itself is a flat leash, which I prefer, as I know they aren't going to get tangled easily.  The housing on the leash is extremely light weight and I couldn't get the button to lock the leash in place.  The clip on the leash section that clips to the dog's collar is very sturdy.

"I am at an age in my life that I have decided I really need to start taking better care of my skin.  I am that woman that has never really had a skin care regimen.I have been using this moisturizer along with the facial cleanser by Punch Skin care for about a week now.  I am really happy with the results.  It doesn't really have any kind of scent to it, which is ok by me!  I love lotions in general and I do use some that have beautiful smells to them, but I don't want that on my face.  I use a mineral based makeup and I was a little concerned that this moisturizer would make my skin feel greasy and not work with my makeup.  However, I was wrong and had nothing to worry about.  My makeup goes on easy and you can't even tell that I have a moisturizer on underneath it.  There is no oily feeling to my face at all, after using it.  I would gladly purchase this again!

"I am really impressed by this Night Cream by Punch Skin Care.  I have been using it for about a week now.  I have to admit that I have been really bad about doing any kind of regular skin care regimen , but as I have gotten older, I have decided that I need to start doing something different.I have oily skin, so I always worry when I use any kind of creams that it will make things worse.  I have not had that worry with this night cream. I have been using the facial cleanser by Punch and then I will take a small amount , put in the palm of my hand and rub it in to my face and neck.  It immediately makes my skin feel soft.  and smooth feeling.  I like the fact that the company makes their products with Organic ingredients.  The cream itself doesn't really have much of a smell to it, which to me is a big plus!  I don't want something that is perfumey smelling on my face.

"I have never been really disciplined with using any type of facial care products, but I have noticed as I have gotten older that I need to pay closer attention to what I am using to take care of my skin.This Facial Cleanser by Punch Skin Care has really made a difference in my face.  I have been using it each night before bed and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  I get a fresh clean feel to my face.

It has little to no smell to it, which is why he has agreed to give it a try.  I am curious to see if it helps his acne.

"I have nerve damage in my hands so I am always looking for a set of shears that I can use that don't hurt my hands anymore than they already do.  I have multiple rose bushes and this is getting to be the time of year that I have to prune them back for the season, in addition to lots of other plants that need tending to right now at the end of the Summer season.These are a ratchet style shear and as such take a little getting used to.  However, the blades on them are good and sharp and do a great job at cutting through my rose vines.  They have a safety lock on them that is heavy duty to say the least.  It does a take a little bit of work to get them to close again, but once you figure it out, it works fine.

I have owned several different styles of gloves over the years and prior to having this set by Aircee , there was only brand that I would use.They are super cute with the little bow on the front.  I am not a big ""bow"" person, however, these are flat to the glove and they just give them an extra little something.  I wish I could describe here how soft these gloves are!  The inside is made of a super soft , almost plush kind of material and the outside are a super soft fleece feeling to them.  These fit my hand so nice and tight!  I can't stand a glove that is bulky feeling and these are not!  They are slimming feeling and I know I will easily be able to pick things up with them, use my phone,etc.  I would absolutely recommend these to anybody looking for a fashionable glove that will keep your hands nice and warm this winter!

"I have several sets of Bluetooth earbuds so I have a lot to compare to.  There are several things that I really like about this set by Coredy..  I mainly use earbuds to be able to talk on my phone when I am working at my laptop.  I need to be hands free, so I need a set that others can hear me on and that of course I can hear them.These come with a nice little carrying pouch, so that I can throw them in my purse and they aren't going to get lost or tangled up.  The cord itself doesn't tangle at all  and then there is a hard piece that is connected to where the earbud is.  I am not sure how to describe that part, but I can tell you that it is the only part that is irritating to me.  Music sounds fantastic on these!  I am by no means an expert on audio, but I do know what I like.  There is a button on the cord where your controls are, for volume and on/off.  That is also how you pair them to your phone or device  you are using.  These paired easily to my Android phone and to my computer.  I like the fact that the charging port is on the control button on the cord, and it is easily accessible.  All in all I would absolutely recommend this set to anybody that needs them for music listening and/or to use with your phone.

"I am like just about every other person in America , who constantly has a phone or other device that seems to need charging.  Of course, they always tend to die at the most inopportune times!!  It never fails, I will have a full charge when I leave the house in the morning and then my day gets away from me and before I know it , halfway through the day my phone is ready to die.The thing I love about this 6000 mAh Portable Charger by Aukey is it's slim design.  I have started keeping it in my purse and it barely adds any weight to my purse.  I hate having extra unnecessary weight in my purse, so that is a big plus to me.  This will take my phone from almost dead to a full charge.  The best part is , the Portable Charger will still have power left in it, so I don't have to recharge it that often.  That is the benefit to having the 6000 mAh.  You do have to supply your own USB to charge the unit itself, but who doesn't have an extra USB charging cable laying around?  i certainly do, more than one if I am honest!

"I own a couple of different style of cases for my Galaxy S6 and this one is just simple enough that I tend to want to use this one more than others right now.  I like the fact that I can actually see my phone and it isn't covered up by a phone case.The case itself is strong enough that it seems as though it is going to give my phone minimal protection.  I like that it is a sleeker style case.  It doesn't hinder me taking pictures or taking videos with my phone, the holes lines up perfectly.  In fact all the holes line up well, the volume button, the on/off and the front button on the phone.  I am able to hear my phone calls without any disruption ,as some other cases tend to do.

" 2:57 MinsI have owned bunches of First Aid Kits oveer the years, but I have to say that this is the nicest set I have ever owned.  This is a complete set for anything you would need in an emergency.It comes in a nice strong material case , plainly marked with what it is on the side ""FIRST AIDE "". It has a big strong zipper on it, and when you open it , it opens into a 3 fold supply compartments.  Inside this you will find anything and everything you would need.

"These are absolutely adorable!!  I have a 9 yr old granddaughter who absolutely fell in love with these!  She and her sister ( 1 yr younger) have had such a great time playing and imagining that they were everything to a fairy to a princess with wings.  I even heard them pretending they were butterflies.They are super simple to use.  They have straps on them that are stretchable so that depending on your childs size and height , they adjust automatically to fit them.  The girls are able to put them on themselves, so totally self sufficient kind of play with these.  There is a little box attached to the middle and on the backside there is a tiny black button that turns them on and off.  They light up with several different lights that are bright enough to really see them.  In fact, if you wanted to make this part of a costume, these would be perfect at night for a child that was out on Halloween.

"This was a lifesaver for me and my best friend.  She had just came home from the hospital after having been in the ICU and we were dealing with some horrible situation.  She has stage 1 kidney failure and as a result, she doesn't realize when she is urinating.  She has severe neuropathy in her foot (she is diabetic and her sugar went over 1200) and because of this problem along with a host of other health issues , she isn't mobile.  So we needed something that we could put under her that would protect the couch she was sitting on.  We had been using puppy pads, but as you can imagine , those didn't really last long and get expensive having to replace them.  We put this pad underneath her and it not only kept the couch dry, but it kept the urine from sitting on her skin and causing her bed sores.  The pad itself is pretty thick and is like a soft cotton type of material on the backside, so it doesn't slide when you put it in place.

"I have mixed emotions  about this bib.  I love the idea of a bib that catches everything like this one does and the material is awesome.  It is super easy to clean up , and food literally slides down the bib into the little ""catch all"" on the front of it.  It is really light weight and easily manageable.  I have seem similar styles that are hard plastic and they are great, but not portable.  I mean it is hard to carry one of those around with you.  This style though, you can literally fold it up and put it in the pocket of the diaper bag and off you go.  The only downside to this is the way it wraps around the baby.  It is hard to get it on your baby when he/she is fussing wanting to get their food.  Or you are in a hurry to move the whole dinnertime process along.  However, it does a great job of protecting that cute little outfit that you have dressed them up in, which is the whole reason for a bib to begin with.  Having said all of that, all in all I am happy with this bib.  I just wish the little holes that you have to push the ""button"" through were easier to manage while putting it on.

"I have had several Wallet style phone cases, and this one does everything that it promises.I got the red one, and the color on it is nice and bright.  The iPhone 6 fits in it nice and secure and yet it is simple enough to remove your phone if you decide you want to change cases.  The charging port , volumes, and all the necessary buttons are easily accessible, so everything lines up nicely.  There is the slot at the back to be able to still use your camera, and have had no issues accessing that as well.  The leather itself, is on the thin side, but it seems as though it will hold up well.  You have several slots for credit/debit cards or your ID.

" 1:02 MinsThis is a great little light and I can see so many uses for it.  It would be perfect for clipping onto your desk , if you are looking for some soft lighting by your computer.  What we have decided to use it for is on my grand daughters bed, I have just clipped it onto the headboard.  I have recently found myself with 2 of my granddaughters living with me , and one of them goes to sleep quickly, while the other one has a bit of problem falling asleep.  We turn the TV off at a certain time, and do away with electronic distractions.  Now she has a soft night light to be able to read by without disturbing her sister, as they are in a the same room.The light itself comes with it's own LED light bulb, and I am assuming based on the experience I have with LED bulbs, that it will last for quite awhile.  The light itself is super lightweight, yet the clip is STRONG.  Almost so strong that I have a hard time holding it open to clip it on the headboard.

"I got this for my son, who is the athlete in teh house.  He does a sport that most people have never heard of called Par Kour.  He goes to a class once a week , and it is non stop activity.  So obviously, he gets hot and sweaty.  I have given him other versions of a Cooling Towel, that to be honest didn't work near as well as this one.This one by MP, is nice and thick , and does a great job at cooling him down.  You simply unfold it, get it wet and hang around your neck and you will be amazed at how cool it keeps you!  I honestly don't understand the technology behind how this works, I can only tell you that it does!  It doesn't feel like a regular towel, and the texture is hard to describe, but when it gets wet, it is kind of soft.  The other thing that my son has decided he is going to start using this for is at work.  He works in a fast food restaurant , in the back at the grill.  As you can imagine , it is hot and sweaty back there.  He has started taking this to work, and hanging it around his neck while working, and it has made a huge difference in how comfortable he is while working.

Yes, my son has run me over with this as he was learning how to fly it!.

We have hooked it up to my son's iPhone as well as my Android phone and it works just as well on both phones. It comes with an SD card, for storage and extra blades in case these wear out.

I will warn you, it flies super fast , which I think is the biggest reason that the learning curve is so hard on trying to fly it without running it into something.  My son has exceeded his dad in being able to fly it so far.  LOL  I do want to warn you, don't fly this when it is windy outside, as I would be afraid of it getting carried away in a good wind.

" 1:44 MinsThis is the 3rd Qi style charger I have used and I am happiest with this style.  It looks sharp sitting on my desk and it has contact with the phoen right away.  Some other Qi chargers, you have to set your phone on it just right to get it to charge.  It doesn't charge quickly, but it works.There is an app that you can download while using this, that turns your phone into a clock while sitting onn the charger.  You are also able to run your pictures or music while using the app.  The one thing I would like to see different about this is the cord.  When I am storing this and it isn't in use, the cord is kind of a pain.  It is permanently attached to the back of the charger, and I would prefer to be able to unplug it but that is just a personal preference and doesn't affect the performance of the charger at all.  I have used this on my phone for several days in a row and I love the convenience of not having to mess with plugging my phone into a charger.

"I own a couple of this style of Earbud/Headphones and this set by Basstyle has done a great job.  They come in a handy carrying case, complete with the USB charging cable.  I personally love this feature ,because I tend to throw earbuds/headphones in my massive purse and then they get all tangled up and I am rough on them.  Then there is always the issue of what to do with the charging USB cable!  ugh!  However, I don't have that worry with this set, cause they are all in the case.As far as sound quality, these deliver a great sound!  I use these mainly to be able to talk on the phone while I am working on my laptop.  When I am talking with somebody, they don't hear a bunch of background noise.  That alone is huge!  I can't say that about most sets that I use and it is very distracting for the person I am talking with!  I have also used these for listening to music and again, I am happy with the sound.  When I wear these, I don't wear them tight to the ear.  I tend to let them kind of sit on my ears, without actually going in.  I hope that makes sense!  They aren't comfortable if you wear them tight to the ear, but the way I wear them, it works out great.

"I have been using these for days now.  I tend to do a lot of work on the computer and need to be on the phone at the same time, so I am always looking for a good set of earbuds that I can plug in and be hands free while working.  This set has been fantastic for that!  When I am on the phone the person on the other end can hear me as if I was holding the phone with my hands.  They have no idea that I am using a set of earbuds!I especially like the cord on them as it doesn't tangle up on me , like most earbuds do.  It is long enough that I can put the phone in my pocket and walk around doing whatever I have to do in the house and again I am hands free.  I have used them to listen to music and I get great sound.  The volume on them is great.  Their is a control buttons located on the cord, that is easily accessible, when you have them in your ears.

"I had a similar trimmer that didn't work near as well as this one by Electric Appliance!  This one has a good strong motor on it and has a good weight to it.  The other style I had was flimsy feeling, but this one you can tell is made well.  The casing around the motor is nice and strong and just has a professional look to it.  Now having said all that, I have to admit, my kids are always telling my hubby to do something with those nose hairs!  Now he has the perfect tool to handle the problem!  I swear that man has hair everywhere!It comes with an extra tool to trim up a mustache or beard.  In fact, we use it to trim around my husbands ears, because yes, he has hair growing there as well.  I have to admit , I tried it myself ,  although I was scared!!  I didn't want the nose hairs to be pulled out, but it doesn't hurt at all.  The part on this that impressed me was the little light.

"I have owned a couple of different long handled brushes like this , I usually get them for my husband.  As soon as this one came in, he immediately told me he liked this one better than any others that I had got for him.  The bristles on this one are harder and stiffer than the others, which for him, is a huge plus!!  He has dry skin and he needs to have a good stiff bristled brush to be able to help his dry skin.  He also has bad back problems and isn't able to reach around and wash his back, so this brush works as  double duty for him.It comes with a string on the end of the brush so you can hang it up and of course, that helps with keeping the bacteria out of the brush.  I hate having one that you have to just lay down over the bathtub.  It is one solid piece and the wood is good quality, I have no doubts that this will be a long lasting tool for him in the shower.

"I am very impressed with the quality of the this Padfolio.  It has a good strong zipper on it, and the leather itself is a nice expensive looking leather.  It has a zippered compartment on the outside, for extra paper storage, receipts, etc.  I am using this for my personal business, keeping track of recipts, etc.  It comes with a calculator, already in it's own little pocket.  There is a large pocket designed for an iPad, and while I don't have an iPad, my tablet does fit nicely in the pocket.  I love that particular feature of this Padfolio, and I haven't seen that in others that I have seen at your typical office supply store.  It also has a variety of pockets on the inside and then as an added benefit, it has slots for credit cards.  I keep the business account's debit card in here, so when I am out and about and have to make purchases, I have it all in one section.  We have aparments and I am also able to keep our receipt book in this Padfolio.  At tax time, I will have all my receipts in one place and won't have to go searching for them.

" 1:06 MinsSo I have to say , this is kind of a cool idea for a Bluetooth Earbuds.  This is perfect for the guy in your life that is always wearing a hat, and of course had the never ending need for music.  For that matter, my grand daughter thought it was super cool and tried to get me to give it to her.  At the moment, it is a toss up between her and my teenage son as to who actually ""owns"" this!On to the quality of the Bluetooth that you get with this hat.  The earbuds fit nicely in both her young ears and in mine as an adult. I am pretty picky about earbuds, but I have to admit that I found these pretty comfortable.  The sound quality that you are getting , well all i can tell you is what I like.  I listen to mainly Contemporary Christian based music and it sounds great to me while listening to it with this set.  I am by no means an expert on audeo, but I know what sounds good.  The control panel is easily accessible, and I found it easy enough to change the channel of the music I was listening to , when I had the hat on.  I paired it to my Android phone and to my son's Apple phone and it paired easily to both of them.  All in all, it is a great little novelty item and would be a great gift.

"I have to admit I have mixed emotions about this Bluetooth Waterproof Speaker by Aukey.  I love the look of the speaker, it is tough and rugged looking.  It is one of those speakers that I know I could allow the grand daughters to hang out and listen to and I am pretty sure that even if they drop it , it isn't going to damage it.  That is just the look and feel that this speaker gives you.it paired super easy to both my Android phone and my son's iPhone.  The control buttons, were a little hard to figure out where they were at first.  You really have to look hard and you will find them on the outside edges.  The controls are marked by a / mark and something that resembles an X.  The thing that I wasn't super happy about was the volume on the speaker.  I expect a waterproof speaker to have some good volume to it  and to sound good while at a higher volume.  I have owned multiple items from Aukey and all of their products are a high quality, and so is this speaker.  I think they just could improve on the volume issue.  If I am in the shower , with the water running, I am usually going to turn the speaker up high so I can hear the music.  Please know that everything that I have written about this product is how I really feel about it and you can read my reviews with confidence.

"In 2007, I was highly skeptical of anything related to horoscopes, tarot card readings, and astrology. I believed that your fate is controlled by your own actions and choices, and horoscopes were just for entertainment. That view changed when in 2008, after having gone through a major turmoil in life, I decided to pick up Suzanne White's ""Chinese Astrology: Plain and Simple"" (Paperback) for reasons I do not exactly remember. What I do remember was that I wanted to learn more about myself -- Who am I? What's my purpose? How can I get better? How can I turn my misfortunes around?Reading that book's section about Dragons, it gave me an idea of what kind of person I may be and who I may become. It helped me understand what I needed to work on, what positives to bring out of myself, and what negatives to work on and be aware of. I thought, ""Why not? Doesn't hurt"", even though I did not believe in anything astrology. The very same year, I also met a friend who did Tarot card readings for fun. Short story: every single one of her predictions came true. Every single one of them. There have been some who were skeptical every time I share my story, but none were able to disprove how she could have possibly known some of the things she told me about that only I could have known. She made me open my mind more towards the unscientific side of things, and with that, I read more of ""Chinese Astrology: Plain and Simple"". I was able to nearly accurately guess someone's Chinese zodiac based on the characteristics outlined in the book. Women were amazed by that knowledge, and it opened up dialogues and intrigue. It also helped me understand which types of women were a better match for me, ultimately resulting in meeting the woman who I now call my wife, a Horse sign.I was so intrigued with the book, I also bought Suzanne's other ones: ""The New Chinese Astrology"", ""Guide to Love"", ""The New Astrology"". Unfortunately, I haven't been a fan of the ""The New Astrology"" or ""The New Chinese Astrology"". I'm not sure why. ""Chinese Astrology: Plain and Simple"" (CA: P&S) was still the most accurate as relating to my own life, and ""The New Chinese Astrology"" did not appear to have the same feeling or pull as the original. Perhaps this may have been due to me not giving those books the same chance as I did with ""CA: P&S"", or perhaps those books became less helpful to me as I had already started turning my turmoil around for the positive. ""Guide to Love"", though I own it, was never read. This is not a ding on Suzanne's books -- they are most likely filled with wonderful readings, but they just weren't for me at the time.""CA: P&S"" is still my favorite, go-to guide today due to the impact it made on my life in 2008. Perhaps it will help you figure out who you are too and who you may become. In all, I do suggest the same thing I tell my friends: a book alone will likely not be sufficient to help you achieve this goal. Dare I say, but the ""stars"" must align in your life as you read the book. In my case, it was the combination of the ""CA: P&S"" book, the tarot card reading friend, meeting another friend who has similar ""powers"" as the tarot card reading one, a strong willingness to find out who I was and how to improve myself, a major turmoil in my life, and coming across all the different people I could apply the new knowledge to and share with. All these combined contributed to me becoming who I am today, and I have Suzanne White much to thank for that. My life became better indirectly as a result of her writings.Use this book not as a ""bible"" or rule book, but as a GUIDE to HELP you with your choices. Bad things are bound to happen in your life, such as 2012: it was a particularly bad one for me as 80% of the year was filled with nothing but bad luck, both personally and at work, prompting my coworker to exclaim that a permanent, black cloud was over my head that year. We laughed every time ""yet another bad thing"" came up. It was too surreal. But what I have learned over the years: things DO happen for a reason. You only get stronger and better from each experience, especially if you look at life at a more positive angle, no matter how bad things get. I survived that very bad 2012 knowing that things could only get better later. Indeed it did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R305KN3KX9B8RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804831882#wasThisHelpful","R305KN3KX9B8RJ","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What I appreciated about the book was that it broke down the entire year's predictions into categories for each zodiac, showcasing both the Chinese and Western astrology to give you a perspective on both. Suzanne White also explains the reasons for her predictions -- the alignment of the planets and so on. She also dives into what to avoid and what to look forward to. I very much appreciate her continued work in providing annual horoscopes since the predictions of ""CA: P&S"" ended up to a certain year I do not recall.Though ""CA: P&S"" is still my favorite, go-to guide due to the impact it made on my life in 2008, I do recommend this new 2016 book as a worthy read for what may be coming to you this year.

My life became better indirectly as a result of her writings.The reason I am giving the review 4 stars and not 5, is that although the book has interesting and entertaining predictions, I cannot at this time endorse their accuracy until the year is actually over. Once 2016 has passed, I will then be able to give a more accurate rating at that time -- perhaps a 5, or even a 3. With that said, with Suzanne White's track record, I am certain that the book will be quite a valuable resource, and I look forward to seeing how the year plays out. Use this book not as a ""bible"" or rule book, but as a GUIDE to HELP you with your choices.On a personal note, I am not looking forward to some of the things Suzanne mentions may be bad for me this year, but what I have learned over the years: things DO happen for a reason.

"I purchased a Panda coin bank for my wife because she loves Pandas. I found prices online varying from $7 - $30, and that big discrepancy in range gave me cause for concern. Upon reading Amazon reviews and researching other websites, it appears that there are many third party copycats of Shine Itazura, the makers of this product. Apparently, Shine Itazura does not sell these outside of Japan. I wanted to buy a genuine, quality-made product of the panda box just as it is pictured here on Amazon with the biscuits and Japanese wording. I also wanted the product to say ""Ni hao"" (""Hello"" in Mandarin Chinese, just like the original.)Apparently, Hamee is a Japan-based, authorized reseller of the Shine Itazura product, and sure enough, they also charge one of the higher prices on Amazon ($20) compared to the other vendors that sell for half that and ship from China. I have nothing against Chinese-made products, but I'd assume that if the product ships from Japan, it most likely is the genuine one.I sent an email to Hamee after placing the order through Amazon and asked them to ensure they'd ship me the Panda just as it's pictured, and that it would say ""Ni hao"". They assured me that they are.A few days after the order was placed, I received the item in USPS packaging. The panda coin box was inside a clear, sealed retail box. You can see the panda (peek through the brown box) through the clear box as pictured here on Amazon.There was no instruction manual included, and no AA batteries. I unscrewed the battery compartment, inserted 2 AA batteries, and switched it On. I proceeded to place a coin onto the bamboo-adorned, white placeholder at the top of the coin box. Nothing happened. I slightly pushed it to add some pressure, and suddenly, ""Ni hao"", and the panda came out to steal the coin. The box then closed and the panda said, ""Bye bye"". My wife, her mom, and my cousin all immediately fell in love. Indeed, it is a very cute product.In regards to some reviewers and commenters being fine purchasing knock-offs of the Shine Itazura for the lower prices -- their argument is that this is a toy and that the cheaper price is fine for them. However, I have read a lot of reviews where they received either the wrong product, one that broke quickly, or one that made the wrong sounds, such as ""Meow"" (cat sound). Since when does a Panda make meow sounds? Regardless, I agree that as a toy, the cost probably should not matter much, and it definitely would not matter to young children. As long as a panda steals the coin, that's all the entertainment the kids need.For those of you who want a genuine product to give to your older friends and family, I do suggest spending a bit more and get the real thing. That way, you'll be assured that you'll receive the right product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1WJL4JN5OYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004R9K95G#wasThisHelpful","RB1WJL4JN5OYK","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"ND filters (Neutral Density), in essence, lower the amount of light that reaches the lens, making the environment appear darker than it is. This allows you to use slower shutter speeds in brighter areas/day time. What does this mean? ND filters help you take silky-smooth ocean wave photos at the beach during a bright, sunny day (which would normally only be possible during dusk/dawn/night time.) Note: unlike GRADUATED ND filters, ND filters (such as this B+W one) darkens the entire scene. Graduated ND filters only darken a portion of the scene (which enables you to balance a bright sky with the ground, for example.)I purchased this item for use with the Canon 24-70mm f/2.8L II lens. Since I own the B+W 82mm XS-Pro Nano UV filter (which is very thin, and as a result, has a very small amount of front threading to attach other accessories/filters), I practically have to stick to the XS-Pro Nano line for all other filters. Case in point: I purchased the B+W F-PRO series Circular Polarizer, and it did not mount onto the UV filter. Getting the B+W XS-Pro Nano version of the CirPol did.The B+W XS-Pro Nano ND Vario filter threaded fine on both the B+W Nano UV and Polarizer filters. I was also concerned about vignetting caused by stacking the Nano UV + Nano Polarizer + Nano ND filters, but thankfully, vignetting was very, very limited at 24mm. There was no vignetting with just the Nano UV + Nano ND filters on.The filter itself is solidly built (like most other B+W filters).The ND Vario filter switched from the various Stops (strength of ND filtering) smoothly and with ease. The ability to change the ND filtering intensity was the biggest selling point.The only issue I found with the filter is that I'm unable to mount the lens hood with it already on (the filter is larger in diameter than the hood opening). I also tried mounting the lens hood first, then threading on the filter, but that was challenging, and even more difficult trying to unmount the filter (since the hood was blocking any ability to grip the filter with your bare fingers.) In other words, don't expect to be able to securely use the hood while the filter is mounted.Pictures came out crystal clear, and though I am fretting over the $300+ purchase price, it was money well spent. I look forward to taking it with me on my upcoming Patagonia trip where I plan on taking slow-shutter photos of ocean waves crashing against the Perito Moreno Glacier walls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PY9Q3EZ2TGPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GU8DRXI#wasThisHelpful","R2PY9Q3EZ2TGPU","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is by far my favorite hot sauce that I use as one of my secret ingredients to my spicy, home-made beef jerky. It adds heat without changing the taste or flavor of my jerky. It has a slow burn, and many who have tried my jerky initially thought it wasn't spicy at all... until the slow burn creeps in and they are wowed by the extra KICK.Most of my friends and family cannot handle more than 2 drops in their soup bowl -- it's THAT spicy!The only complaint I have is that the eye dropper plastic actually DISINTEGRATED on me the first time I purchased it. I'm not sure how or why, but my best guess is that the sauce ate through the eye dropper when I transported it to and from work on a daily basis. I have since separated the content into smaller glass bottles so that I can leave one at home and one at work. Also, do not leave the item in the refrigerator. Doing so may have contributed to the disintegration of the eye dropper.This second time around, I'm storing the product in a dark, cool pantry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BBC3DS06DMG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DG4NJ#wasThisHelpful","R2BBC3DS06DMG2","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After owning a heavy-duty, expensive, but very sturdy Manfrotto tripod, I was looking for a lighter, solidly-built solution to take on my travels. I backpack in the wilderness a lot and have an upcoming trip to the windy, icy Patagonia in South America, the southernmost land on our planet. As such, a light, sturdy, affordable solution was sought. I own a Canon 5D Mark III, a SpeedLite 600EX-RT, and the heaviest lens I have is the 70-200mm f/2.8L II. The tripod would need to be able to support all that weight for when I go on a professional shoot, yet be portable for airport carry-on and strapping to my backpack.MeFoto was a brand I had never heard of, but after extensive research, it appeared to be one heck of a strong, versatile, compact, and VERY affordable tripod manufacturer -- and cherry on top: a wide selection of colors. My choices ultimately came down to the MeFoto Roadtrip and the Backpacker. I ultimately chose the Roadtrip, and in this review, I will share with you what my thought process was, and why I ultimately selected it.PROS- Lightweight for tripods of its class- Compact- Beautiful colors- Looks very professional- Converts to Monopod without any tools- Compatible with any Arca-Swiss style quick-release plate- Can be deployed quickly- Fairly inexpensive when compared to other high-quality tripods- Very durable and well-built- Manual is easy to understand- Includes metal spikes for use on slipper surfaces- Carry case included and professional-looking. Zippered pouch on the inside- Ballhead is very smooth and makes for excellent, 360-degree panning- Ballhead locks into position, allowing camera to be positioned at any angle- Center column can be reversed for macro photography- Retractable hook at bottom of center column helps with stability- Separate Drag and pan controls- Deploys quickly for vertical (portrait) shooting- Accommodates up to 17.6 lbs of camera gear- Rubberized legs are solid and can be replaced (cheaper tripods tend to fail in this area)- Extendable up to 61.6"" in height, and folds to 15.4""- Legs can be taken apart for cleaning- 5 year warrantyCONS- A bit heavier than I would have liked for wilderness backpacking, but that's what the MeFoto Backpacker is for- Carry bag adds an additional 1/2 lb to the 3.6 lb tripod (Description does not mention this)- Leg angles only come in 2 positions- Legs do not lock in the travel/fold-up position, making carrying it by one leg impossibleWHY I CHOSE THE ROADTRIPBoth models fold very compact and can extend to quite a long height. The Backpacker is the lighter of the two, is more compact, but does not extend in height as much. It also does not feature the option to convert to a Monopod (which is useful for quickly stabilizing your gear without all the extra weight of a tripod), nor does it have a Drag option (which controls how smoothly the ballhead can move, depending on the weight of the camera gear.) I chose the Roadtrip because it can extend higher, can hold up to 17.6 lbs (vs roughly 9 lbs), and comes in the very cool and unique red/blue/white-colored Commemorative Edition.To give you an idea, the Canon 5D plus 24-70mm f/2.8L lens is roughly 5-6 lbs. While this would work very well with the Backpacker, I was concerned that a strong gust (like Patagonia's 70+ mph winds) could tip my gear over, although you could further stabilize the tripod by adding weight to the built-in, retractable hook found at the bottom of the reversible center pole. The slightly extra weight of the Roadtrip would add additional stability and be able to carry 17.6 lbs of equipment, making it more versatile for non-wilderness uses such as wedding photography, though mind you, weddings can sometimes be wilderness in their own right :) The Roadtrip, in other words, would allow me to mount a 400mm Canon lens, should I ever go that route, whereas the Backpacker would not be recommended for such scenario.The extra weight of the Roadtrip was a very big concern for my wilderness adventures, however, where I tend to carry 75+ lbs on my back for 5+ days. The Carbon Fiber version of the Roadtrip would shave off an additional 1/2 lbs, but I did not want to pay the extra premium for that little weight saving. If money was no concern, I'd have certainly chosen the Carbon Fiber one.IMPRESSIONS OF THE ROADTRIPThe tripod can be neatly and quickly folded into a compact 15.4"". There are other tripods that provide the same folding mechanism, but based on my research, the quality of those manufacturers are not as good as MeFoto's. The product contains a carry bag, metal spikes (so that it can be used on slippery surfaces, such as Patagonia's ice glaciers), and a hex tool (for tightening/loosening the leg anchors and quick release plate) as accessories. The latter two and manual are found in the inside, zippered pouch of the carry bag.The red/white/blue accent colors look just as nice as shown in the product pictures, and the colors make it look unique enough that other photographers should not mistaken mine with theirs.When the tripod arrived, it felt quite heavy. It actually took me by surprise. As it turns out, the tripod indeed is 3.6 lbs, but the included leg spikes and carry bag make it roughly 4.1 lbs as a package. Keep that in mind if you plan on taking it with you on your wilderness adventures. I'd most likely leave the carry bag at home, and cover the ballhead with a small stuff sack to protect it against dust while hiking.I had never used twist-type leg locks before, though I do have them for my hiking poles. My initial impression is that the twist lock makes for a very rapid deployment, crucial for when I backpack with friends and they don't want to wait too long for me to take my long-shutter shots.The center pole can be extended and also reversed by first unscrewing the bottom, retractable hook. This makes it possible to mount the camera upside down for macro photography. The ability to remove the center pole also allows you to pair it with one of the legs (marked with unlock/lock symbol at the angle anchor) to make it a Monopod. Very cool! The hook allows one to hang additional weight (such as your camera bag) for increased stability.The ballhead is removable (for future upgrades), and the quick release plate is compatible with any Arca-Swiss style accessory, making it possible to attach other types of accessories. I was very impressed by the three, separate knobs that allowed me to control the 360-degree panning (great for panoramic shots) and head separately. The ballhead moved surprisingly smooth and with precision, and can be securely locked into place by the knobs. This allowed the camera to be positioned at any angle, something I could previously not do with the cheap, lightweight tripods I used to carry with me. In fact, without the solid build and lock, I was always extremely afraid of shooting my camera vertically! A little bump or gust, and there goes the camera flying to the ground! With the RoadTrip, I no longer have that fear.The angle markers below the ballhead help make more precise adjustments. I also like that the camera can quickly be switched into a vertical shooting position by moving the head into the groove. The integrated bubble level allows for even pans and head movements.One of the legs has a foam grip, making the tripod more easily maneuverable. Likewise, the two-angle positions allow the tripod to stand firmly in a specific position, or to where all three legs can be horizontal, lowering the camera to a 15.4"" height. The legs can easily be taken apart for quick cleaning of sand and other debris.My biggest gripe with the tripod, however, is that the legs cannot be locked when they are in the travel/fold-up position. This makes carrying it by one leg impossible. I resolved this by attaching a velcro loop around one of the legs, and using that to secure all three. This then allows me to hook up the Roadtrip to the side of my backpack.Although the Roadtrip was made in China (indicated by a sticker on mine), it is solidly made, and comes with a FIVE-year warranty, indicating that the manufacturer has very strong support behind its product. It is fairly lightweight and very compact for a tripod of this caliber, and I have absolutely no reservation recommending it to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7N48DABC3J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXNCQY8#wasThisHelpful","R2U7N48DABC3J1","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an IT professional who deals with technology every day, and is very much into gadgets.

Yes, I have used a lot of tablets -- Apple iOS, Google Android, and Microsoft Windows 8. I'd like to preface that among all products, the Surface Pro 3 is my favorite for its versatility: tablet for play and consumption, laptop-like for work. Most importantly: it just plain works with the Windows ecosystem (hardware and software).HP Stream 7 is a surprisingly fluid Windows 8.1-based tablet that comes with a 1 year subscription to Office 365 Personal, a $69 value. More on that later. What makes it surprising is its performance for its price. (Note: I purchased this tablet from the Microsoft Store.)PROS- Holds easily in the palm of my hand and in the back of my jeans pocket- A quite powerful Windows PC in the pocket of your pants!- Fluid performance of the Windows Store apps, helped by the Quad core processor- Traditional Windows app performance acceptable- Very inexpensive- Includes Office 365 Personal for a year ($70 value). Effectively making the tablet cost just $30!- Runs the full Windows 8 OS (not the crippled ""RT"" version). This lets you install traditional programs like on a regular laptop- Can access every file share that a Windows tablet/PC can connect to- Beautiful, bright screen (1280x800 resolution)- Screen can be seen from any angle!- Has 32 GB storage, expandable by a microSD card (tested with 64GB card)- Throw standard movies/videos onto the storage or microSD card, and watch them on this tablet without any conversion necessary- Bluetooth and Wifi- Battery lasts as much as 8 hours- Front and back cameras make video conferencing via Skype a possibility- Charges via standard microUSB port- microUSB port supports USB On-The-Go (OTG) cables. Allows you to connect hard drives, flash drives, memory card readers (for backing up your camera pictures). Can attach a USB hub to connect even more devices- Can run 2 Windows Store apps side-by-side- Plays videos (including Plex/Netflix) perfectly, including AVI, MKV, MP4, etc.- Despite having just 1GB RAM, I was pleased to be able to launch 8 Windows Store apps and easily switch between them- Supports Miracast wireless display casting (like Apple's ""AirPlay"", Samsung's ""AllCast"", Roku, etc). Allows you to project your tablet to a TV/projector -- even use it as a second monitor. This was tested with the MS Wireless Display Adapter. This did not work with Fire TV mirroring- ""Signature Edition"" is available through the Microsoft Store. That version gives you the Stream 7 without any additional software added by HP- Supports Bluetooth keyboards and miceCONS- At 0.8 lb, it feels heavy. Perhaps I got spoiled by the iPad Mini/Nexus 7/Surface 2, but its heft is noticeable- Speakers are loud enough in a room, but does not produce the best sound quality. What do you expect for a tablet at this price?- Only has 1GB of RAM although it has been able to perform acceptably- Although Miracast display mirroring works, it's not as fluid as the $1500 Surface Pro 3- microSD card slot is accessible after opening the back cover- Spoiled by the Surface Pro 3, the tablet appears thick- There is no Charge indicator light. So, you have to turn on the tablet and look at the battery icon to see whether it is charging or full. Worse, connect a generic charger that may not provide enough power, and the icon shows that it's charging, but... mouse over the system tray's battery icon, and it shows ""Connected, but not charging"". In other words, check that your non-HP charger works before you walk away- Only has 5-point multi-touch (Surface Pro 3/iPad do 10-point). With a tablet this size, 5-point works well enough- Typing on the on-screen keyboard was sometimes (not very often) laggy. Maybe I typed too fast.- ""Signature Edition"" is only available through the Microsoft Store- No GPSOFFICE 365 PERSONAL subscription (included for 1 year)- 1TB of OneDrive storage (Microsoft is upgrading this to UNLIMITED at no extra charge soon!)- Full copy of Office for 1 PC or Mac- Full copy of Office for tablets/phones (iPad, Android, Windows Phone)- 60 minutes of international Skype-to-phone calling- Worth $70/year- After the 1st year, you'll have to renew the subscription, but with all the benefits listed above (especially the UNLIMITED cloud storage), I find this a steal- Can upgrade to Office 365 Home after the 1st year, which comes with 5 accounts that you can share with friends/family, each getting the above benefits for their own account[EDIT 11/19/14: I found my OneDrive upgraded from 1TB to 10TB while Microsoft prepares to upgrade everybody to Unlimited storage. You can get on their upgrade waiting list at https://preview.onedrive.com/]The Office 365 Personal subscription is activated by launching the Office app icon from the Start screen. This takes you to the Office 365 website from where you activate the subscription. I was erroneously expecting a voucher in the box. The activation appears unique -- meaning, you cannot have another person log in to the tablet and try to claim another free subscription. Further, if you already have Office 365 Personal, I believe that the activation will simply extend your existing subscription by a year, but I cannot confirm.TIPS- I use Google Chrome all the time. However, just like on the Surface Pro 3 Core i7 (top-of-the-line), it does not play well -- it hogs memory and CPU resources! Further, it also does not scroll very smoothly. As such, use Internet Explorer (Store app version) for best performance. The slow performance is a GOOGLE problem, not a problem with the tablet- Treat this tablet like a Surface RT tablet, not a laptop: use the Store apps whenever you can. Consider the Desktop and the ability to run regular Windows software as a bonus. See this tablet as a laptop, and you'll be disappointed due to its small screen- Enter BIOS mode by turning the tablet off. Then push (and keep holding) the Power + Volume down buttons at the same time. Works the same way as the Surface Pro 3- The Windows Store version of Internet Explorer (IE) has Adobe Flash built in. You can also download Flash and install it for use with your browser of choice: IE, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc. However, IE will give you the best performance since Microsoft optimized IE for Windows 8 tabletsNOTES- The installed Windows OS is 32-bit- Since this tablet can run the full Windows OS, I surmise you could turn this into a full-fledged, basic server to use at home. Usage scenarios I can see: 1) torrent server. 2) Server to connect to via Remote Desktop/Teamviewer/Splashtop, allowing you to check on your files or security camera while you're away. 3) Server to control your home automation devices. 4) File server to host your files/movies/pictures (by connecting a USB hard drive via a USB OTG cable).- With the upcoming Windows 10 release, Windows Phone and Windows PC/tablets will be merged into a single system. This means that apps written for the phone should also work for the PC/tablet. This will hopefully encourage developers to focus their apps to run on the Windows ecosystem. Meaning: more, better quality apps! I have high hopes.I purchased this tablet to supplement my Surface Pro 3, HTC One M8 android phone, and my wife's iPad. A tablet so cheap, I can simply lay it around the house for anyone to grab to quickly look things up. At $99 - $69 (I planned to sign up for the Office 365 Personal subscription anyway) = $30, the Stream 7 is extremely affordable. Throw movies onto the tablet and watch them in the car or on the plane. Or, in my case, to launch something on a remote server via Citrix or Remote Desktop, or to move files around between computers (told you, I'm in IT.) I am very pleased with this purchase, and applaud Microsoft for lowering its Windows licensing fees to make inexpensive Windows tablets a possibility.TIP: take a look at the Anker Multi-Angle Portable Stand to use for this tablet (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N1VDCGO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)--------- 12/10/2014 UPDATE WITH STREAM 8:I recently purchased the Stream 8, and although I bought it for $80 more than the Stream 7, I returned the latter.

Both tablets are essentially the same specsCONS:- A bit pricier than the Stream 7- Cellular radio can drain battery faster. I keep mine turned off (Settings > Mobile Broadband > Off) until I need to use itTo activate the free, lifetime cellular subscription, go to Settings > WiFi (turn it off). Then tap the ""Mobile Broadband"" connection. It'll direct you to the T-Mobile page for activation (SIM card is already pre-installed underneath the back cover). Once activated, you may turn back on the WiFi radio.All in all, I am much happier with the Stream 8 than the Stream 7, although the latter is still an EXCELLENT value for its price.

"I am an IT professional who deals with technology every day, and is very much into gadgets. Over the years, I have played with the HP TouchPad, Google Nexus 7, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Asus Transformer, iPad, Surface, and Surface 2. I now own the Surface Pro 3. Yes, I have used a lot of tablets -- Apple iOS, Google Android, and Microsoft Windows 8. I'd like to preface that among all products, the Surface Pro 3 is my favorite for its versatility: tablet for play and consumption, laptop-like for work. Most importantly: it just plain works with the Windows ecosystem (hardware and software).HP Stream 7 is a surprisingly fluid Windows 8.1-based tablet that comes with a 1 year subscription to Office 365 Personal, a $69 value. More on that later. What makes it surprising is its performance for its price. (Note: I purchased this tablet from the Microsoft Store.)PROS- Holds easily in the palm of my hand and in the back of my jeans pocket- A quite powerful Windows PC in the pocket of your pants!- Fluid performance of the Windows Store apps, helped by the Quad core processor- Traditional Windows app performance acceptable- Very inexpensive- Includes Office 365 Personal for a year ($70 value).

"I installed this patch panel in my new home with Cat6 wiring, Cat6 keystone jacks, and Gigabit capable endpoints. It was easy to use (there's not much to it -- punch the wires down by following the color chart printed on each jack for the appropriate standard 568A or 568B) like most other patch panels.In speed tests, I have observed Gigabit speeds on my network, although a couple ports only perform at 100 Mbps. I have not yet found whether this was due to a faulty keystone jack, fault in the wiring going through the house, bad punch down at the patch panel, faulty jack at the panel, or faulty jack on the D-Link Gigabit, unmanaged switch. As some reviewers have pointed out, some had difficulty getting the patch panel to certify for CAT6 performance. Nonetheless, I am fairly happy with my purchase -- it was very inexpensive, and nearly every port has been performing at Gigabit speeds for the past 7 months with no problems.This product is good value, but would I use it in an enterprise setting? Most likely not. I'd probably get Panduit for enterprise/critical business settings. For home use, this product is more than sufficient for my needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ATJ3FF1W7ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AZK72#wasThisHelpful","R21ATJ3FF1W7ZT","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using the Varidesk Pro for about a month now. I realize that this product listing is for the Single version, but since I was unable to find a Pro listing at the time of this writing, I thought that I'd share my thoughts here anyway as both products are practically identical.The Pro version is designed to be able to hold TWO monitors.I have been suffering with lower back pain since February 2013 that was caused by an unfortunate car accident. One of my spinal discs slipped slightly, causing enough pain not to be able to move much, not to mention getting in or out of bed. After half a year of physical therapy, and having my workplace provide me with a $1,000 ergonomic chair, my back was still hurting from the all-day sitting in front of a computer.I had heard about standing desks, but the only ones I was able to find were cost-prohibitively in the $1,000+ range. One day, I saw an article mentioning the VariDesk product line, and the price was just right. Instead of a furniture that could be lifted up and down (standing/sitting position), this product would utilize an EXISTING desk to accomplish something similar. I mentioned to contact Varidesk for a trial, and after using it for a couple weeks, I felt some relief for my back, but it would still hurt at the end of the day. Further, I also found that my neck became stiff due to the way I was now sitting in an effort to be ergonomical. Regardless, I preferred the desk over the standard desks provided by the company, and managed to get my HR department and manager to approve me the purchase of the Varidesk Pro.After using the Varidesk for about half a year, I remembered my therapist telling me that sitting for prolonged periods of time was bad for the body. She stated that standing would be preferable because your core muscles would be engaged at all times. So, I decided to stand practically all day with the Varidesk in a higher position, but careful to have the keyboard still at a 90 degree angle with my arms/elbows. The first few days, it felt uncomfortable -- tiring even. I hated it, and switched back to sitting in the chair for the majority of the day.About three months ago, I decided to once again try to stand all day, and shoved my chair to the side. The result? After the initial adjustment period, I no longer felt the need to sit down, and my back pain stopped becoming noticeable! My knees sometimes need a rest, but a few minutes of sitting down (and feeling very good and relaxed in doing so!) resolved that issue. Nowdays, I go home with hardly a thought about my back. I was recently able to participate in my second Tough Mudder race event, and came home with minor soreness of the back. It appears that my core muscles have indeed been engaging more often, providing relief to my back.With that said, my coworkers have been noticing the oddity on my desk. The Varidesk Pro is a big piece of furniture, and it sure is to turn heads either by its size, or simply by the fact that I'm standing at my desk with the monitors raised high beyond my low-walled cubicle. As colleagues started asking questions about the desk, they too started inquiring to HR whether they could have one -- they were also suffering from back pain. Two other employees received one, and they have been very, very happy. One exclaimed that the product has been one of the best things for his back. Another employee is waiting for budget to allow him to purchase one too sometime this month.My manager has been contemplating about getting himself one too, but because this desk is a bit big, he decided not to get it. This is the biggest negative with the Varidesk Pro: its size. Perhaps the Varidesk Single is smaller, but you would lose the ability to have 2 monitors on the desk.This product is good for those suffering -- or not even suffering -- from back pain. It's a much better, ergonomic alternative to an under-desk keyboard, ergonomic chair, and what not. Use it while standing on your feet most of the time, and get yourself a stress mat to help alleviate the pressures on your feet and knees (I have yet to get one myself -- its cost is about $18 last time I checked). As a side effect of standing most of the time, I also found my eyes looking away from the monitor more often, helping them get a break from staring at the computer screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R5LLO2SJS3JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBFRN8K#wasThisHelpful","R2R5LLO2SJS3JD","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased some cheap respirators from Home Depot, and found them to be lacking: I had a hard time keeping the mask's shape, having to toss them after just a few uses. Further, my nose was runny most of the time due to my exhaled air staying within the mask.I decided to purchase this particular one since safety is of a big concern for me. It addresses all the issues I had with the cheaper brand: holds its shape very well (and can be reused many, many times), and the filter at the front of the nose helps keeps the airway flowing.It protected me very well from dust/saw dust.

"I tried this particular brand and product from our local, Italian market (Cortina's Anaheim, CA), and have been a fan since, purchasing 1lb every now and then to have with Italian basil, provolone cheese, olive oil, shredded iceberg lettuce, and a toasted, white bread.I like this product because unlike regular salami, this one has a nice, spicy kick to it.

"This review is written after having used the keyboard with the iPad Air (for which it was designed), and for seeing if it can be used with other products, such as the iPad Mini Retina, iPod Touch, Apple TV, and the Microsoft Surface 2.In short, it performed remarkably well as a keyboard for the Apple products, and decently for Windows-based devices. I especially liked the fact that the same keyboard I use for the Air can be used with the Apple TV (some keyboards don't work with it.) Now on to the details.I have been purchasing New Trent products for several years, and I've consistently found that they have pretty well-made products, and most importantly, listen to customer feedback extensively. As such, I was pleased to see the company release a dedicated keyboard/cover combo for the iPad Air.When the product arrived, I noticed that the packaging looks better than their past products. It's minimalist, clear, and the white color reminds you that it's for the iPad Air - as if floating lightly on clouds. Photo: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo3AR50QXEVMHQV/B00GP4BVTO/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkThe case/keyboard was encased in a see-through wrapping, and to its left, the charging cable can be found inside a smaller, white box. The finish of the product is smooth, feels sturdy, solid, and premium. Equally important, the iPad Air fits snugly in the case, and the overall weight is negligible.After I switched the On/Off switch to the ON position, I hit the WIFI-symbol button, indicating to the keyboard that I'd like to sync it with the Air. On the iPad, go to Settings > Bluetooth, and you'll see ""Keyboard"" available for pairing. The iPad will ask you to type in a certain code on the keyboard, followed by Enter key, and the pairing is made. That was easy. With that said, here are some Pros and Cons in a list format to make it easier to read:PROS- Case folds on top of the keyboard, making it easier to use the iPad as a tablet- Case can be pushed back in a laptop-like format- Case turns 360 degrees, allowing for landscape/portrait orientation in upside and downside positions- Product can be used on the lap- Keyboard works extremely well:o Keys are spaced comfortably aparto Gives a nice, audible feedbacko Gives tactile feedbacko Responds quickly on the screen - there was no lago Has battery/Bluetooth indicatorso Brightness, Volume, Media Playback (Play/Pause/RWD/FF), and Volume keys are conveniento Has dedicated Lock button (invoked by pressing Fn-Lock)o Home/Task Switching (Square symbol) key works just like the Home button: single push = Home. Double-push = Task switching. Hold the button = Sirio Shuts itself off when not in use for an extended period to save battery life- Sturdy, solid, premium-feeling finish- Metallic, silver logo makes the case feel a bit more premium and executive. I wouldn't be embarrassed to take it to work.- Gloss above the function keys adds to the premium feel- Bluetooth was easy to sync- Battery life of keyboard is excellent - lasted over a week (and still haven't had the need to charge)- Product is fairly light in weight- Packaging and manual are clean, clear, and free of grammatical errorsCONS- Even though case folds on top of keyboard to allow iPad use as a tablet, the hinge side is a bit bulky, making it awkward to read a book in portrait mode. Horizontal mode is acceptable.- Case cannot be detached from the keyboard (for times when I want to use the iPad without the keyboard attached)- Fn-Globe key (on spacebar) did not do anything. I expected it, based on the Globe, to launch an app, such as the web browser- Has no Caps Lock light indicator when the key is On or Off- Rubber Nubs (below the spacebar) designed to protect the iPad from scratches may get in the way of typing whenever you hit the Spacebar. You can feel them there.PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY- I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard works with the Apple TV (ATV). This beats having to use the Apple TV remote control to type in passwords and the such. I've tried some other keyboards that did not work with ATV.- Keyboard also worked the same way with iPad Touch and iPad Mini Retina.- Keyboard worked with the Microsoft Surface 2, although the Square (symbol) key did nothingI understand that the product was designed for the iPad Air, but I'm always happy when something works with other products too - saves me from having to buy another keyboard, such as for the Apple TV.Overall, this product was well-designed, has a smooth, premium feel, and is not flashy/ugly to be used in a business setting. If New Trent can figure out how to make the case be oriented at various angles (to allow for different eye level heights), that would make the case even better. As Microsoft showed with the Surface 2, one angle does not fit all, and the introduction of a 2nd angle made the product much more useful to use in a wider range of situations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G5CF52EWDC2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP4BVTO#wasThisHelpful","R2G5CF52EWDC2X","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I waited for a long time for some sort of protection for the Surface 2 that would not add much bulk, yet allow for uninterrupted access to the kickstand, and for the design of the product to stand out.I first waited for the Incipio Feather cover, but it is only available for the Surface RT -- trying it on the Surface 2 resulted in very poor fitting. I have used a Neoprene case to protect the tablet in the meantime, and when I came across the Skinomi full-body protection for Surface RT, my interest was lit. I finally found that they make it for the Surface 2 as well, and this is what the review addresses.The packaging stood out -- it was received in a cardboard tube similar to ones you would use to mail out posters. Inside it were instruction guides, microfiber cloth, a spray containing a water and mild detergent solution, a squeege, and, of course, the screen protector films. The latter was on two, glossy sheets instead of being in individual, plastic bags like other screen protectors I have purchased in the past. The entire content inside the tube, by the way, was inside a sealed, plastic bag.After reviewing the instructions, which included washing your hands, removing dust particles from the tablet, and spraying your hand with the spray solution, I continued with the installation. The guide states to first watch the installation video Skinomi made available, but I ignored that tip. Before we go on, I would like to also add that you should put the tablet on a clean, dust-free table with excellent lighting, and to turn off the tablet to prevent any water damage. Also make sure that you have adhesives available, such as Scotch tape (more about that later.)The below procedure can be repeated for each film part:1. I sprayed the solution onto my fingertips (this was not mentioned in the instructions) to help keep fingerprints off the protective films, and proceeded with the biggest film: the screen protector. You should start with the biggest film first to help align the smaller ones.2. Turned it upside down with the adhesive side facing me, and sprayed the liquid onto it (never spray onto the tablet itself, specially where there are openings/holes!) as evenly as possible. Do not spray too much -- a thin layer is fine. The trick is to distribute the liquid as evenly as possible. Next, I double-checked that there were no dust particles or lint on the screen, and placed the film onto the tablet, carefully aligning the edges and camera opening.3. Used the squeege to softly smoothen out the surface, drawing out bubbles and larger air pockets. There's no need to remove the tiny, tiny bubbles (""micro bubbles""), as they will disappear on their own after 2-5 days.4. When I found dust particles or lint on the screen, I taped one Scotch tape onto the film to lift up the section closest to the particle, and used another Scotch tape to remove that particle from the screen or film. Repeat until all particles are gone, and use the squeege to smoothen out the film once more.5. After waiting for a few minutes, the film will dry, and will start sticking to the tablet's screen. If it does not stick, or if you have to repeat the process, remove the film, let it dry, then start over.Next, I applied the protective film at the upper half of the back. I wanted to apply the bottom one last so that I could rest the tablet on the desk without having to worry about the film being shifted while it was drying.Next, applied the smaller film of the upper back, the one for the back camera. This one was trickiest to install. I had to do this one twice. The first time, I applied the film to the back side, then folded it to cover the top portion of the tablet. However, the top portion would not stick since it was still wet. I struggled for a while, and it eventually stuck, but I noticed bubbles at the edge of where the top and back meet. I decided to remove the film from the top of the tablet, let the back portion (back camera side) dry and stick (be sure the power button opening is still aligned with the button). Once that was dry and was no longer shifting, I then applied the spray to the top part of the film, bent it, and held/smoothed it until it, too, was dry. Now the top and upper back portion are flush.Finally, I applied the two side films, followed by the larger film for the bottom back.Let the tablet dry for a few hours. Better yet, leave it alone (and still powered off) for 5+ hours, or overnight. This ensures the film has had proper time to adhere, and that no liquid may still be lingering that could short the tablet's electrical circuits.With the above procedure described, note that I installed the films in the evening with not as good of lighting as I had hoped. This morning, I discovered small bubbles (not the tiny/micro ones) in a few areas of the screen. Tonight, I will be removing the film, and try to re-install it with the remaining spray liquid, being more careful about bubble removal this time.I decided to knock this product's 5-star rating down to just 4, because it does not come with a protective film for the side UNDERNEATH the kickstand. The installation instructions also did not address how to install the tricky back-camera/top's film. To address the former, I cut and used my old screen protector for the back underneath the kickstand instead.I really do like the product, but will continue to wait until some manufacturer creates a tight-fitting case that does not obstruct the kickstand. Note: the Incipio Feather for the Surface RT does hinder the kickstand even for the product it was designed for.Hope this helps you with the installation of the product, and if it does, please be sure to click the ""Helpful"" link at the end of this review.UPDATE 1/8/2014: I was able to successfully re-do the screen protector portion. First, I wet my hands, removed the film, sprayed it, and laid it on top of the screen. I then slowly pushed out the bubbles by going diagonally across the film (bottom-left of screen and towards top-right) and slowly working my way to the opposite corner. Once all the water was pushed out, I took my fingers and slowly ran across the film to ensure there are no small bumps (they were the ones that caused the bubbles to stay on the previous try). Whenever I found a small bump, I lifted the film closest to it, and pushed out that bubble. Continued this process until I found no more bumps, bubbles, or lint anywhere on the screen. After letting it dry overnight, my tablet now looks perfect. Lots of compliments have been received for the tablet -- hardly anybody knew that there was any sort of protective film all over.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJBELXZF8YML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPT5J8O#wasThisHelpful","R3BJBELXZF8YML","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review was originally posted for the PLAY:1, but I'm modifying it for the BRIDGE since the review applies to both products.I just purchased a home and was looking into having it wired for whole-house audio. Looking into multi-room systems on Amazon, it was apparent to me that it wouldn't be cheap: cost of the speakers, controllers, PLUS cost of running wires throughout the house. When I saw the SONOS PLAY:1 and BRIDGE promotions, I found its wireless solution to be more cost effective, and with better speakers to boot. Below are the pros and cons that led me to decide for the Sonos system.NOTE: a Sonos BRIDGE is NOT needed to use the PLAY:1/3/5, etc. See the INSTALLATION section of this review. The BRIDGE is primarily used to extend Sonos' wireless range at lower cost than additional speakers.PROS- Hi-Fi. Speakers sound better than the multi-room, wired systems I looked at for less than $500.- Resale Value. Wired speakers don't add much resale value to your house. So, why spend $1000s, only to leave the audio system behind when you sell the property or move? With wireless, I could take my expensive speakers with me to my new home.- Freedom to move around.With wireless, you are free to take the speakers anywhere you want throughout the whole house. For neighborhood block parties, I could even hook up the speakers to an extension cord out to the street, and stream music from my home. Or take it outside to your backyard. They are moisture-proof, but I wouldn't use them as permanent outdoor speakers unless you enclose them in protective casings.NOTE on wireless: each SONOS component is its own wireless client and repeater. Sonos wireless is a private, wireless ""mesh"" system, separate from your home WiFi. What does that mean to you? It routes music through its own wireless, leaving your home WiFi untouched. There's an additional benefit for that, as I'll explain after the installation note below. Most of the Sonos components (PLAY:1 is NOT one of them) have 2 network ports. This means, you can plug in the component into the network jack, and use the 2nd one on the speaker to connect your laptop.INSTALLATION: First, the tech talk. You need 1 Sonos component to be plugged in to your home network (any of the PLAY speakers, Soundbar, Bridge, etc.) So, as an example, you must plug in either the BRIDGE or the PLAY:1 to your network with a network cable. This turns that component into a wireless access point (or as consumers tend to call it, a ""Wifi router"".) All other Sonos components will now be able to wirelessly talk to that plugged-in device. No other Sonos component has to be plugged in, as long as it's within wireless range of the plugged-in one. Should a component in your house be too far away (say, your garage) from the plugged-in one, you can connect it to your network via cable, if available, or set up a Sonos BRIDGE (or any other Sonos speaker) wirelessly somewhere between the plugged-in one and the Garage speaker. The BRIDGE or other speaker strengthens the wireless from the plugged-in one, and extends the range to the one in the Garage. Each Sonos component is both a wireless client, and a wireless access point/repeater. Each component talks to each other in a mesh network. Think of a spider net. Any part that is touched vibrates to the rest of the net.Tech-talk aside, think about this: One person (Person 1) is at a corner of the house. When he shouts, the person in the garage (Person 2) can't hear Person 1. The only way Person 1 can talk to 2, is to pick up the phone (talking over a wired connection, or plugging a distant Sonos component to the wired network) or having Person 3 stand between them (having a Sonos component physically be between both speakers) and relaying the information back and forth (what WiFi mesh would do). So, with each Sonos component/speaker, the Sonos wireless range gets extended.With the Sonos wireless mesh, you could humorously place a few speakers into each house in the neighborhood, and suddenly play the same music through each home. Try that with Bluetooth speakers. You wouldn't be able to.WiFi mesh TIP: if you have an Android device, you can Google ""Android devices on SonosNet"", and you will see instructions on how to use your Sonos wireless network (""SonosNet"") to connect your Android phone/tablet. This allows you to use your mobile device further away from your home WiFi. This has disadvantages and advantages out of the scope of this review. I decided not to use SonosNet for my tablets.NOTE: a Sonos BRIDGE is NOT needed to use the PLAY:1. Just plug in the PLAY:1 to the wired network (ie your router), and it will work just fine. You still control it with the Sonos App from your mobile device. Once the PLAY:1 is plugged in, you can add other Sonos components to the system. A BRIDGE is NOT needed for that either. It's only needed if you want to extend the Sonos wireless range to a farther part of your house or yard for $50 vs buying another PLAY speaker for $100+)- Small size. The BRIDGE is about the same size as an Apple TV/Roku/WD TV Live.- Ease of Pairing. To pair other Sonos components (or with the Sonos Controller App), simply hit the Play/Volume Up button on the speaker, and the same combination on the other speakers. If pairing with the BRIDGE, hit the pair button on that component.- LED. The Bright LED can be configured to turn on/off via the Sonos app.- Ease of music sync.You can use the free Sonos app for your Android, iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod), Windows Phone, Mac/Windows laptop/tablet (sadly, no Windows Store app yet) to control how the speakers play: you can easily choose which speakers to pair/unpair into groups. Grouping the speakers allows you to play the same music on those speakers. You can have up to 32 separate groups. You can also individually control each speaker from the app. Each group's volume is controlled by the Sonos app. So, if Speaker 1 is set to 50% volume, and Speaker 2 is set to 25%, lowering the volume by 5% will lower Speaker 1 to 45%, and 2 to 20%.Once music is playing, you can leave the house, and it will continue to play -- as long as the music source is not coming from that mobile device (meaning: if you're playing MP3s from your phone, and your phone leaves, it will stop playing. But if you started Pandora from your phone, or you told the speaker to play music off one of your network shares, it will continue playing since the source is coming from a device that's still at home.)PARTIES: one cool feature is that once you download the Sonos Controller app and pair it to one of the Sonos speakers (which authorizes the app/phone to talk to your Sonos system -- this prevents unauthorized people outside your home from controlling your speakers), each device can control the playlist. So, if you have guests coming over, and each guest downloads and authorizes the Sonos app to your system, each guest can now add/remove songs from the queue. Everybody can now be a DJ.- Expandability.Sonos did a smart thing. They released the less expensive PLAY:1 to wet your/my appetite, and gave away BRIDGE for free, too. As you use the system, you will likely buy more Sonos components to expand your sound system, resulting in more revenue for the company. You can add any Sonos component to your system, and they will all work in harmony. You can set up a complete home theater system that way too. I know, sounds pricey. It is. But it still is cheaper than having your whole house wired with nice speakers.- Alarm/Sleep timer.You can set up each speaker (or Group of speakers) to play music at a specific time, day, and volume (Alarm) from a specific source for a specified amount of time. Or you can also set a Sleep timer to play music for a specific number of minutes to ease you into sleep. I love getting waken up by mellow music (ie. Norah Jones) in the morning, and when I leave the home, I don't have to worry about turning off the speakers. It'll automatically turn off after the 45 minutes I set up for the alarm.- Sound. Sound quality is quite good. I will leave you with the reviews by others to read more about that. With the Sonos app, you can control Bass, Treble, and volume. I have the speakers play between 15% to 25% volume in each room -- they are plenty loud enough. Setting them to 100% can be heard through the whole house -- and the potential for your neighbors to complain. Even at low volume, the sound is very good. It's definitely better than most Bluetooth speakers. If you put the PLAY:1 in the corner of a room, the sound seems a bit more muffled due to the amplification of the Bass by the walls on both ends. You can fix this by adding more Treble, or by moving the speaker away from the corner.- Design. The PLAY:1 and BRIDGE are beautiful devices. They don't look out-of-place in my home. I bought the White ones.CONSI couldn't find many cons with the PLAY:1. But here are some that have annoyed me.- Cost. The Sonos system is expensive. Just look at the price of the other components. Holy moly. Still, if you were to wire your house with Bose speakers, the Sonos system is comparatively inexpensive. Again, I chose Sonos because wiring the house won't add much resale value. I like the idea of being able to take my Sonos with me to my new home.- Sonos App Interface. The app is clunky and looks outdated. It took me a while to figure out where to go to do what (and I love gadgets/toys. I'm a technology tinkerer!). It's not very user friendly.- Music sources. Not all apps can play to the Sonos speakers. You have to use the Sonos App, add the approved source to it, then you can play from that source. I wish you could re-route any audio from any device to the speakers. Pandora, network shares (NAS), iTunes, TuneIt Radio (built-in), iPod/iPad/iPhone, media files on your own Android/Windows device are all possible sources. At one point (if I remember correctly), my not-so-tech-savvy dad was able to beam his iPad's YouTube sound to the speakers without using the Sonos App. I didn't get a chance to verify how he did it, but I did see the PLAY:1 being available as a target on his iPad. Perhaps it was playing via the DLNA protocol. Either way, that was neat.- Input source. I wish that the PLAY:1 had a Line-in/Aux port so that you can connect any music source to it for playback, such as your TV or existing home entertainment system. Yes, the Sonos CONNECT takes care of that, but look at the price of that component! Even then, the CONNECT doesn't support SPDIF/Optical input.Weren't it for the Amazon/Target promotions on Black Friday, I would have been EXTREMELY hesitant to buy these expensive speakers. I bought two PLAY:1 during the promotion. With that said, overall, I'm quite pleased with the purchase. It came out cheaper than wiring the house, and I get to control my music from any of the mobile devices. That's neat. Lower the prices of your other components, Sonos! I hope for increased competition in the market to drive the prices down -- as of today, I'm not aware of any good, alternate, wireless HiFi solution.I have the BRIDGE installed downstairs in a 2-story home. One PLAY:1 is upstairs, and one PLAY:1 is downstairs. I may purchase more PLAY:1s in the future. The BRIDGE is not needed at all for my home since one of the PLAY:1 can act as the wireless access point for the other.------EDIT 5/12/14: Almost half a year later, and I'm still enjoying the PLAY:1. By the way, Sonos is working on making it unnecessary for any Sonos component to be connected to the wired network/router. From their blog post, titled, ""Our Vision for Rock-Solid Wireless, Evolved"" (April 17, 2014), ""We've found a way to deliver all the benefits of SonosNet without a product directly connected to your router... Start with a speaker and your smartphone, enter your WiFi password and Sonos takes care of the rest.""I've also updated my review with the clarification, ""Most of the Sonos components (PLAY:1 is [NOT] one of them) have 2 network ports."" (Thank you, JOEKC, for pointing out the original review's error)EDIT 6/16/14: Clarified that SonosNET is a proprietary wireless network.

"Easy to install (hook up white wire with white, and black wire with black. Be sure to turn off power first, if you're uncomfortable with electrical work.

"After I read that Time Warner Cable was going to raise their modem lease to $8/month, I looked into whether it's possible to buy and use your own. Sure enough, the SB6141 was one of the approved modems. Instead of paying $8/mo to lease their clunky, old modem, I went ahead and bought the SB6141 -- it pays for itself after less than a year. The saving I get from it is now used to subscribe to Netflix's $7.99/month plan. Check your cable bill -- I went as far back as 2008, and wow, I've been paying Time Warner for leasing their modem for the past 5 years! That's at least $300!The SB6141 modem has worked reliably and rapidly in Orange County, CA, for both Time Warner Cable and Cox. Despite other reviews I have read, Time Warner actually did upgrade the firmware to the modem a few days after I installed it myself. I noticed the upgrade when I checked the logs. Nonetheless, Time Warner Cable in my area has had periods of slowdown (going from 15 Mbps down to 1 Mbps at times!), and it didn't matter if I rented one from them or used the SB6141.The Web Interface/Logs can be accessed by going to [..] with your browser. In case Amazon edits the link, the URL is [...]I have moved to a Cox area recently, and purchased a second SB6141 (I gave the 1st one to my brother) instead of leasing one from Cox. It worked right out of the box. Speeds have been usually consistent at 18-24 Mbps (I'm on the 18 Mbps plan), sometimes dropping to 5 Mbps. I haven't been using the Internet long enough yet to see how reliable the modem is with Cox, but from the logs, there haven't been any disconnects. I also have a very strong signal coming to my home, as verified with the Cox-employed cable installer.[UPDATE 4/2/2014: I have been using this modem for the past 7 months with Cox Irvine, CA, and have been experiencing consistent, 32 Mbps speeds for the past 3 months in speed tests. Considering that I'm only paying for the 18 Mbps plan, getting 32 Mbps is wonderful. The modem has been working very well, and I am very happy with the purchase.]Purchase this modem. Save yourself the cost of renting it from your cable provider. Check with your cable provider's website which modems are compatible before you do buy one.Once you get the modem, write down the MAC address that's usually printed at the bottom or side of it. Call your cable provider's support line (in my case, Time Warner Cable), and tell them that you bought a modem. They'll need to update the MAC address associated with your account with the one you just wrote down. A few minutes later, it should work. Doesn't require a very tech-savvy person to get this going :) Time Warner Cable also requires you to return the leased modem to one of their TWC Stores (it can't be mailed in.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPJSZFCVF3HNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJHDZSI#wasThisHelpful","RPJSZFCVF3HNB","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I previously owned an IDEAL crimper, and after crimping hundreds of RJ-45s, my hand eventually tired. I decided to buy this Paladin one because it can crimp RJ-45 and RG6 (coax). I no longer saw a need to crimp any RJ-11s (phone) (which the IDEAL one had.)This crimper performs very well. It made it easier to crimp with less effort.Further, the head can be changed -- this modular design allows you to buy an RJ-11 template, if you so desire, and crimp RJ-11s with this same crimper.

Grouping the speakers allows you to play the same music on those speakers. You can have up to 32 separate groups. You can also individually control each speaker from the app. Each group's volume is controlled by the Sonos app. So, if Speaker 1 is set to 50% volume, and Speaker 2 is set to 25%, lowering the volume by 5% will lower Speaker 1 to 45%, and 2 to 20%.Once music is playing, you can leave the house, and it will continue to play -- as long as the music source is not coming from that mobile device (meaning: if you're playing MP3s from your phone, and your phone leaves, it will stop playing. But if you started Pandora from your phone, or you told the speaker to play music off one of your network shares, it will continue playing since the source is coming from a device that's still at home.)PARTIES: one cool feature is that once you download the Sonos Controller app and pair it to one of the Sonos speakers (which authorizes the app/phone to talk to your Sonos system -- this prevents unauthorized people outside your home from controlling your speakers), each device can control the playlist. So, if you have guests coming over, and each guest downloads and authorizes the Sonos app to your system, each guest can now add/remove songs from the queue. Everybody can now be a DJ.- Stereo pairing for PLAY:1.You can take two PLAY:1 speakers and set them up as Left & Right channels for stereo output.- Expandability.Sonos did a smart thing. They released the less expensive PLAY:1 to wet your/my appetite. As you use the system, you will likely buy more Sonos components to expand your sound system, resulting in more revenue for the company. You can add any Sonos component to your system, and they will all work in harmony. You can set up a complete home theater system that way too. I know, sounds pricey. It is. But it still is cheaper than having your whole house wired with nice speakers.- Alarm/Sleep timer.You can set up each speaker (or Group of speakers) to play music at a specific time, day, and volume (Alarm) from a specific source for a specified amount of time. Or you can also set a Sleep timer to play music for a specific number of minutes to ease you into sleep. I love getting waken up by mellow music (ie. Norah Jones) in the morning, and when I leave the home, I don't have to worry about turning off the speakers. It'll automatically turn off after the 45 minutes I set up for the alarm.- Sound. Sound quality is quite good. I will leave you with the reviews by others to read more about that. With the Sonos app, you can control Bass, Treble, and volume. I have the speakers play between 15% to 25% volume in each room -- they are plenty loud enough. Setting them to 100% can be heard through the whole house -- and the potential for your neighbors to complain. Even at low volume, the sound is very good. It's definitely better than most Bluetooth speakers. If you put the PLAY:1 in the corner of a room, the sound seems a bit more muffled due to the amplification of the Bass by the walls on both ends. You can fix this by adding more Treble, or by moving the speaker away from the corner.- Design. The PLAY:1 and BRIDGE are beautiful devices. They don't look out-of-place in my home. I bought the White ones.CONSI couldn't find many cons with the PLAY:1. But here are some that have annoyed me.- Cost. The Sonos system is expensive. Just look at the price of the other components. Holy moly. Still, if you were to wire your house with Bose speakers, the Sonos system is comparatively inexpensive. Again, I chose Sonos because wiring the house won't add much resale value. I like the idea of being able to take my Sonos with me to my new home.- Sonos App Interface. The app is clunky and looks outdated. It took me a while to figure out where to go to do what (and I love gadgets/toys. I'm a technology tinkerer!). It's not very user friendly.- Music sources. Not all apps can play to the Sonos speakers. You have to use the Sonos App, add the approved source to it, then you can play from that source. I wish you could re-route any audio from any device to the speakers. Pandora, network shares (NAS), iTunes, TuneIt Radio (built-in), iPod/iPad/iPhone, media files on your own Android/Windows device are all possible sources. At one point (if I remember correctly), my not-so-tech-savvy dad was able to beam his iPad's YouTube sound to the speakers without using the Sonos App. I didn't get a chance to verify how he did it, but I did see the PLAY:1 being available as a target on his iPad. Perhaps it was playing via the DLNA protocol. Either way, that was neat.- Input source. I wish that the PLAY:1 had a Line-in/Aux port so that you can connect any music source to it for playback, such as your TV or existing home entertainment system. Yes, the Sonos CONNECT takes care of that, but look at the price of that component! Even then, the CONNECT doesn't support SPDIF/Optical input.Weren't it for the Amazon/Target promotions on Black Friday, I would have been EXTREMELY hesitant to buy these expensive speakers. I bought two PLAY:1 during the promotion. With that said, overall, I'm quite pleased with the purchase. It came out cheaper than wiring the house, and I get to control my music from any of the mobile devices. That's neat. Lower the prices of your other components, Sonos! I hope for increased competition in the market to drive the prices down -- as of today, I'm not aware of any good, alternate, wireless HiFi solution.I have the BRIDGE installed downstairs in a 2-story home. One PLAY:1 is upstairs, and one PLAY:1 is downstairs. I may purchase more PLAY:1s in the future. The BRIDGE is not needed at all for my home since one of the PLAY:1 can act as the wireless access point for the other.------EDIT 5/12/14: Almost half a year later, and I'm still enjoying the PLAY:1. By the way, Sonos is working on making it unnecessary for any Sonos component to be connected to the wired network/router. From their blog post, titled, ""Our Vision for Rock-Solid Wireless, Evolved"" (April 17, 2014), ""We've found a way to deliver all the benefits of SonosNet without a product directly connected to your router... Start with a speaker and your smartphone, enter your WiFi password and Sonos takes care of the rest.""I've also updated my review with the clarification, ""Most of the Sonos components (PLAY:1 is [NOT] one of them) have 2 network ports."" (Thank you, JOEKC, for pointing out the original review's error)EDIT 6/16/14: Clarified that SonosNET is a proprietary, wireless network","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33MNA7E32PUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EWCUK98#wasThisHelpful","R33MNA7E32PUK","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful light fixture, especially when coupled with LED bulbs. It was easy to install (connect black with the black wire, and white with white wire.) The motion detection worked great (it does, like other lights of its kind, have a blind spot directly below the fixture.) In my testing, motion was detected 5' from the fixture.NOTE: DualBrite is, disappointingly, NOT a feature of this lantern, despite what the Amazon description states. Even the box does not mention DualBrite. In other words, there are only two states available: ON (motion activated or manual) or OFF. With that said, it's still a great light. The manufacturer's website also has no mention of DualBrite for the White model: [...]Summary of the various modes available:TEST - use this to test the light. It allows the light to turn on even in daylight. The first time you turn on the switch, the light turns on for a minute while it calibrates, then it turns off. Now you can walk around to activate the motion detection -- it turns on instantly, and turns off again after about 10 seconds or so.The same switch for TEST can then be set to 1, 5, or 10. Each number corresponds to the number of minutes the light will stay on after motion is detected. These modes are considered ""AUTO"" mode. AUTO mode only turns on the light at night time (when motion is detected.) During daytime, light turns itself off.MANUAL mode: manual mode allows you to override the motion detection portion. To activate it, turn off the switch for a second, then back on. The light will now stay on until daylight, after which it will turn itself off and revert back into AUTO mode. This is a great feature -- I use it to keep the light on for when guests are visiting, and in case I forget to turn it off, rest assured, it will be off automatically in the morning.If you don't want the light to stay on until the morning (when it's set to MANUAL mode), simply turn the switch off for 1 minute, then switch back on. The light will turn on to calibrate itself, then it goes into AUTO mode.I wish that the DualBrite mode came with this lantern so that it would be on all night long at a low level.This is a great light, and I'll be ordering another one in a few days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJLPRZ8T6DPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YE3RL4#wasThisHelpful","RRJLPRZ8T6DPO","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a professional photographer who owns 2 Canon 5D Mark III and several, very pricey lenses. For my upcoming honeymoon, however, I did not want to lug around such expensive gear and having to constantly look over my shoulders to not get robbed. The Sony NEX-7 became my camera of choice to take on the trip for its small size and DSLR-like abilities. Furthermore, a smaller camera -- instead of a big DSLR with a big lens -- would help make the photo subject feel a bit more at ease getting photographed.The Kit lens that came with the NEX-7, the 18-55mm, unfortunately shoots horribly when compared to my professional, Canon L lenses, and I started my search for a replacement lens. I was saddened to find a very small selection of available lenses for the NEX series (E-Mount lenses) that were of the quality I was looking for. Granted, the NEX-7 with its interchangeable lenses were far superior over the PowerShot S95 point-and-shoot, an excellent camera for its class, I previously used.Carl Zeiss makes excellent lenses, and so I took a look at this Sonnar T* E 24mm F1.8 ZA.Aperture of f/1.8 would enable great bokeh (background blur), as well as better low-light performance. I hardly shoot with Flash when I travel, and this was an important plus.The 24mm length, coupled with the NEX-7's 1.5x crop factor, would turn the lens into an equivalent 36mm lens on a full-frame camera, such as the Canon 5D. As my go-to lens for everyday shooting is the Canon 24-70mm f/2.8, the 36mm falls nearly right in the middle of that range. It is also just shy of taking pictures at a 1:1 life-size ratio (which 50mm lenses do on a full-frame camera, or 33mm on the NEX-7, should Zeiss release one in the near future, as has been rumored.)Being forced to shoot at 36mm (with no ability to zoom in or out) would require you to adjust the way you photograph. Not an impossible task, but something to be aware of. You'll have to learn to move forward or backward to ""zoom"" in and out. Be careful when you back up before you fall into a pool!This lens is only slightly longer than the kit 18-55mm lens, and as such does not add any more bulk.Pictures taken were very sharp, and when compared with those taken of the same subject in the same condition with the kit lens, the Zeiss is far, far superior in sharpness and color.The bokeh (background) blur is creamy smooth, and what pleasantly surprised me is this lens' ability to shoot macro. What is Macro? The ability to shoot objects, such as a ladybug, at extremely close range. For example, for a recent wedding assignment, I tested this Zeiss to photograph the rings at extreme closeup. The jewelry was very, very sharp! You could not get the same sharpness with the Canon 24-70mm or Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L lenses.Focusing in low-light was quite speedy, and so I am looking forward to using this lens with the NEX-7 on my upcoming honeymoon.The biggest gripe with this lens is its cost. That's the price, however, that you have to pay in a market where there aren't that many good alternatives available for the NEX cameras. Perhaps the cost will drop once more quality lenses enter the market.The only concern I have is that neither the camera nor the lens are weather-sealed, potentially allowing dust and moisture to enter the camera. This is true for most cameras with interchangeable lenses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R229HM6A3BAJVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IHAI8O#wasThisHelpful","R229HM6A3BAJVW","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased two Revues when it was first released (about 3 years ago?): one for my parents, one for myself. The premise of being able to watch Live TV, surf the web from a desktop-style browser, install apps (this was introduced over a year after the initial release of the Revue), watch Netflix, do TV-based video conferencing, and the ability to watch DLNA/network-shared movies was exciting.The Revue was, at its initial release, a mess. I will not address these as that's in the past. Logitech updated the Revue to the Android Honeycomb-based Google TV software, which introduced installable apps. Logitech eventually and abruptly abandoned the Revue due to dismal, and sold the remaining units in a flash sale.I will not review the Google TV software itself. What I will cover, however, are items specific to the Revue, and why I ultimately got rid of it and its associated TV Cam.GOOD:1. Netflix streaming quality was consistently better than the same app on the Sony BluRay player I had. Its interface was also better than Apple TV v3: as you fast-forwarded/rewound through the movie, you were presented with thumbnails. Apple TV does not do that.2. Keyboard was nearly full-sized, allowing for quicker typing. The included TouchPad also worked very well, and using TWO fingers, you could scroll up and down pages with it. It was very responsive. Compared to the Apple TV, Roku, or PlayStation 3, finding things was galaxies easier on the Revue keyboard.3. Logitech added unique value to the Revue, which was both a good and bad thing. Good: Video Conferencing ability (more on that later) and ability to play movies from network-based shares. Bad: manufacturer customization can delay the release of updates. The Revue was consistently behind the competition with getting the latest software updates.4. Movies (DivX, etc.) played well from network-based shares (Windows, NAS) via DLNA. The browser interface was a bit clunky, but it worked.5. Logitech TV Cam, when working, was excellent for video conferencing with the parents. See the BAD section for more.BAD:1. Logitech abandoned the Revue. Do not expect any more updates from Logitech, though Google promised to still support the product. During the time I owned both Revues, updates were far and few in-between.2. Chrome web browser was horribly slow. I often found myself browsing on my smartphone or tablet instead.3. Amazon Prime and NBA apps were abandoned. They no longer worked.4. Logitech TV Cam, which I had used to do video conferencing with my parents, was a pain to configure. Ports had to be opened in the firewall, and although I am an IT Systems Engineer with sufficient knowledge on firewalls, I had struggled getting this to work. I couldn't imagine how an average person could set this up. Once it was up and running, video conferencing worked GREAT... Until the Honeycomb Google TV update. My parents' TV Cam still worked well and doing a test call to Logitech VID's test account succeeded. I could never get it to work on my own TV Cam at home again. Video conferencing was now broken, and the Revue was primarily used for Netflix viewing only. I have been considering to get 2 Logitech TV Cam HD units, which is a stand-alone, HDMI-connected, Skype video conferencing device.5. Memory leaks would eventually slow down the Revue, requiring a reboot.I ultimately sold both Revues and the TV Cams after my parents replaced theirs with the Apple TV. They lost the video conferencing ability, but an iPad or iPod via Skype or Facetime over AirPlay would suffice. They are quite happy with the Apple TV.My brother gave me an Apple TV v3 as well, and after playing with it, it reaffirmed to me that I do not like Apple's closed ecosystem or its tight grip on the use of its devices. I am eagerly awaiting for someone to jailbreak/hack the Apple TV v3 to allow the installation of XBMC, freeing it to do things that I liked the Revue for: freedom from shackles. Ability to play movies from network shares, and more. Alas, this review is not about the Apple TV, but about the Revue.I do not suggest you purchase the Revue. For $99, there are better Google TV alternatives out there from Vizio, Sony, Asus, etc. However, I feel that the Google TV platform still has a long way to go. Roku, AppleTV, WD TV Live Streaming (my choice among the three) are not as extendable as Google TV, but are far less frustrating to use. I am happy to see, however, that we are seeing more and more TV-centric, connected devices being introduced.NOTE: those of you who still own the Logitech TV Cam for Revue, note that Logitech is discontinuing its Logitech VID service due to the availability of other video services, such as Skype. Since the TV Cam ONLY works for the Revue (well, I got it to work with Windows 7 before after tinkering with drivers), Logitech is offering an exchange program for qualified owners. The exchange program ends sometime in September 2013 and started April 18, 2013.I had been a long-time customer and supporter of Logitech products: keyboards, mice, speakers, and remotes. However, with the sudden abandonment of the Revue, its poor support of the Google TV platform (during the years when the manufacturer still provided official support), and its questionable call to lock the TV Cam to ONLY work with the Revue (and not PCs/Macs), left a VERY sour taste in my mouth. The quality that the company used to be known for severally dropped, making me question whether I would purchase another Logitech product again. The company has an uphill battle to win this customer back, though the recently-announced exchange program for the TV Cam was a good, first step in the right direction. Kudos to the new CEO!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU6EX3V3CSDAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040QE98O#wasThisHelpful","RU6EX3V3CSDAJ","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case mirrors my review for the Sony-made case. As such, I will paste that case's review here and edit it for the MegaGear one. The edits will be enclosed within brackets like so: [edit].""This case fits the NEX-7 perfectly with the kit lens attached. It also fits with the Carl Zeiss 24mm f1.8 Sonnar E-mount lens on. The lens hoods have to be taken off the lenses or mounted in reverse to be able to fit.The case is made of [a leather-like material] and has a [less premium] feel to it. The camera is attached to the Half Case via the tripod mount. This presents a problem. More on that later.How does it protect the camera? It certainly protects the camera well against day-to-day bumps during everyday use. However, I am concerned that if you drop the camera in it, depending on the angle of the impact, the NEX-7 and/or its attached lens may not fare very well.Another concern I have is against dust: the side openings are large enough for dust particles to enter. As an experienced DSLR professional photographer, I have had situations (early in my career) where grains of sand deposited onto the sensor during shoots at the beach. Similarly, I have had moisture enter the camera body during shoots in the humid Amazon rain forest. I do not believe this case to adequately protect against those environments. However, the case will sufficiently protect the camera against light rain.Some reviewers at other sites have commented that this case can block the rear LCD from being pulled out. This is partially true -- yes, the LCD cannot be pulled out easily. Perhaps that's a plus: it'll help prevent accidental dislodging of the LCD. The way to pull the LCD out while attached to the case, start by pulling on the bottom of the LCD, not the top.Since the camera body is attached to the case via the tripod mount, the Half Case (the part that is screwed onto the camera's tripod mount) unfortunately blocks the battery slot. This is quite frustrating: access to the battery and the memory card are blocked until the camera body is unscrewed from the tripod mount. This is the MOST frustrating part of the case.The case does allow for quick shooting without taking the camera out: simply unclip one of the buttons located at the bottom right of the body, flip the top portion of the case over and under the camera, and you are ready to photograph. With the case hanging the way it does in this position, it does make you look like an amateurish, ridiculously-looking tourist or photographer.So, fashion-wise, this case looks ridiculous when you open it to photograph, and the blocking of the battery/memory card door is ridiculous. The biggest plus for this case is the fact that it does not add bulk to the camera. As such, it serves as a good protector of your camera while being transported in your backpack or carry-on suitcase. For its price, ... this case [is a good alternative to the Sony one.][...]One of [this case's] buttons broke the moment I unclipped it to put the camera body on.

"I purchased this backpack from REI two years ago for traveling to Peru/Machu Picchu. A big concern was my expensive camera equipment ($5,000 at the time), and I wanted to have a bag that would be able to house the Canon 5D Mark II, Canon EF-S 24-70mm f/2.8L lens, and various other items.This pack fit the camera and lens (both kept inside a small LowePro bag) well. What I liked about this backpack is that it has a metal mesh at the bottom and bottom front, making it difficult for someone to slash through the bottom and unknowingly removing your equipment. Furthermore, the zippers can be clipped and hidden, making it slightly more difficult for a thief to quickly get into.The reinforced carry straps also make it difficult for a thief to perform a grab and run, and one of them is removable, allowing you to attach the backpack to a solid object or a chair while dining at a restaurant.The material is solid and as well-made as a wilderness backpacking-type backpack. It resists abrasion quite well. There are also many hooks for you to attach various items. You can use inexpensive carabiners to further extend the amount of items you can hang.By all means, this backpack is not intended to be as safe as ... well, a safe. My advice is that if a thief tries to grab the backpack and won't give up (or shows a weapon!), it's best to let him or her have it if your life is in danger. Things are replaceable. You are not.Travel safe. Be safe. Be aware of your surroundings. Do not look like a victim. No well-made backpack will make you safer than being aware and looking like you would be a tough target. Like trying to break into an alarmed and non-alarmed car, thieves would rather hit someone weaker than you (in this case, the non-alarmed vehicle.)In my case in Peru, when I was traveling through an area that did not seem safe, and there weren't other tourists in my group, I would stash the camera equipment inside the bag. Again, do not make yourself become a target. Be smart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSIO4LG2LOTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JQL8OY#wasThisHelpful","R1NSIO4LG2LOTC","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The items arrived quickly (within a week), and the cover fits the iPod Touch 5th generation perfectly.The best way to apply these types of screen protectors is to follow this procedure:1. Open the package.2. Clean your hands and fingers afterwards. You may have caught some paper particles onto your fingers while opening the package.3. Ensure the area is free of dust.4. Thoroughly clean your screen with the included microfiber, and blow out any dust with a can of compressed air.5. First, remove the film (as labeled) on one side, and slowly align it over the holes.6. As you lower the rest of the film, smooth out any air bubbles with your finger in a horizontal motion.7. If you see any dust particles or small bubbles, lift up that part of the film, take a piece of tape, and use it to remove the dust particle from the protector.8. Keep repeating Steps 6 and 7.9. After the protector is fully applied, remove the top film, as labeled.10. If you still see dust particles somewhere, take another piece of tape and place it on top of the protector. Use this tape to slowly lift up the protector at the spot where the dust is at. Again, use another piece of tape to lift the dust off the protector. Repeat until satisfied.I repeated the last step (10) about three times before my protector was finally perfectly on the iPod Touch. Absolutely no dust particles or little bubbles can be found!The protector does its job of keeping the screen scratch free, but it also is a bit on the frosted side (it's matted), diminishing some of the beautiful brightness of the iPod. On the other hand, the matted finish helps prevent glare.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15MOAEP7YLB40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZGYWYK#wasThisHelpful","R15MOAEP7YLB40","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Note: calf size is a better measurement for which size to get.Sleeve Size, Calf Size, HeightX-Small/Small, 9.5 - 12.5"", 5'3"" and belowSmall/Medium, 12.5 - 15"", 5'4"" - 5'10""Large/X-Large, 15"" and up. 5'11"" and up[Update 3/18/2013]I've worn these sleeves during an intense workout, and was amazed at how my calves felt.

I have definitely been recommending this product to all my fellow athletes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HJH3SPMXM7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088WS4AA#wasThisHelpful","R8HJH3SPMXM7D","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a professional landscape photographer since 2005, and not until the release of the 600EX-RT, did I find much interest in putting Flash to work. I owned three 580EX II's, but did not want to invest in PocketWizards or any other type of triggers.With the 600EX-RT's built-in radio, I finally made the plunge and sold the 580EXs to get 3 600EX-RT's. I must admit, my experience with multiple flashes has been limited, but with the included manual, setting up the various groups was a breeze. I was able to use all three flashes within minutes of reading just a few pages of the manual.Because these are radio-frequency controlled, you do not need a direct line-of-sight (the 580EX requires it). So, you can position the flashes in any way you want, and all of them will communicate with each other constantly and without hesitation. Cycle time is amazing, and the flashes do not overheat as quickly as the 580EX II's.It is also nice not having to carry around multiple batteries for both the SpeedLite and external triggers (ie. PocketWizard), making for great weight and bulk savings. One less equipment to worry about on a photo shoot.Canon sells a newer control unit (ST-E3) to be mounted on your Canon dSLR (I own two 5D Mark III) for use with the SpeedLite 600EX-RTs. However, Canon took a step back with it from its predecessor by removing the autofocus assist beam. For that reason, I purchased the 3rd 600EX to be used as the Master unit by simply setting it to NOT fire a flash.Get the Canon CP-E4 battery pack to help flash many more times and to shorten the SpeedLite's cycling time.The case is much improved over the 580EX II's -- it comes with a built-in velcro strap that allows you to attach the bag to your camera bag for ease of access. Further, it also comes with a small loop with which you can use a carabiner to attach with as well.The 600EX-RT also comes with a Color Filter Holder, and an Orange filter. They both can be easily transported in the included, smaller bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10AEFEZEUF25Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FH1KX2#wasThisHelpful","R10AEFEZEUF25Q","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using the LoseIt! app for Android/iOS (Apple) to keep track of my weight losses and gains, and one annoyance I always had was remembering to record my weight measurements. This scale makes that convenient.It records your weight (for up to 8 individuals), and sends the information via WIFI to Withings.com. From there, LoseIt and other applications can receive the readings.The app and website provides a nice, graphical view of your weight history, including a trending graph -- that graph was instrumental in helping me see that I was INDEED losing weight, despite seeing my weight bouncing up and down hopelessly. It was right.When you weigh yourself, and you are similar to other users (in my case, my 2 brothers), it gives you an option to select which of the users you are by simply shifting your weight. However, the only issue I have is that there is no way for you to let guests use the scale without messing up the reading of the programmed individuals. I wish that the scale would ask if you are a guest or one of the users. I often have to go to the website to delete/correct readings that were not made by me.All in all, a beautiful, convenient scale.Battery life: it worked great for a year. On the second battery, the battery lost its charge fairly quickly (within a month or so.) I discovered that my WIFI access point was performing spotty during that time. After I fixed that issue, a fresh set of batteries has worked well again. So, those concerned about battery usage being too high, check if the scale has sufficient strength going to your WIFI router.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW2Z22BLD3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JE2PSA#wasThisHelpful","RW2Z22BLD3N","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I absolutely love the taste the liquid provides when added to shabu shabu or any other soup dish. 2-4 drops works great for me, although 2 or 3 seem to be the most popular among friends and family. The liquid provides a slow, even burn at the back of the throat -- a ""kick"" that I thoroughly enjoy in my meals.This liquid is one of my secret ingredients for my home-made jerkies. Adding 50 drops or so to my 8 lbs of meat gives it just the right spiciness -- and that ""KICK"" -- that EVERY SINGLE friend, family, and colleague has consistently complimented me on.The biggest gripe I have, however, is that the eye dropper's plastic LITERALLY melted. I do not know if this was a result of the liquid somehow bonding with the plastic, but it is a big, big health concern. I kept the cap in my kitchen, and also carried it with me to restaurants at times. When I noticed the plastic melting a bit, I kept the whole bottle in the fridge, just in case the California summer heat caused it.With the eye dropper completely disintegrated, I transferred the liquid to a glass jar for the time being.

"This product is well-made, and very comfortable to wear. I am an avid half-marathon/full-marathon runner (I do about 4 a year since 2008), and needed something to carry my phone, ID, and keys with. This fit the bill.I keep my phone and ID in little sandwich bags to prevent any possible sweat from ruining them, although I did not run into any severe wetness issues. It also did not have much bounce while running.My bib gets attached to the belt loop via the safety pins.The only issue I have run into, after two half-marathons, was the inside pouch ripped. Presumably this is because of my large Samsung Galaxy S3 phone being too big for it (meaning, I may have overpacked the bag.) I'll stitch the pouch back to the bag and reinforce it.All in all, a highly recommended product.UPDATE 2/22/13: I took a closer look at the ripped, inside pouch, and found that it could not have been caused by my phone or ""overpacking"". There were smaller tears visible at the still-good areas, and my conclusion is that the rips were caused by the velcro that closes the inside pouch inside the bag. The velcro must have caused enough strain to the material. If that is the case, then buyers beware: the nylon appears to be of poor/old quality then. I didn't bother to send the bag in for repair or warranty service. I opted to sew the pouch back and, in the process, reinforce that area to counter-act the velcro's force.

"I had never installed any internal after-market products in my car before (with exception of a trailer hitch). I went to ToyotaNation.com and YouTube to find how-to's, and found one thread with pictures at ToyotaNation.com for a similar Toyota Highlander. This helped guide me enough to give me the courage to open up my car panel and work on the audio system.I had purchased the USA SPEC BT35-TOY Bluetooth module for my Toyota Highlander 2008 Sport and was thoroughly dissatisfied with that product's poor sound quality. It had no bass oomph.So, I took a chance and purchased this PAC product with their Complete iPod Kit. It was easy enough to install. The iPod cable is thick and solid, and although it worked with my iPod Touch 4th generation, I have since bought the 5th generation with the Lightning connector. You have to purchase a 30-pin-to-Lightning adapter if you want to continue using it. However, keep in mind that the adapter is only useful for CHARGING your iPod. Audio would not play through it. Bluetooth, which is what I bought this kit for, would be the only connectivity option.Sound quality is superb through Bluetooth! Much, much better than the BT-35. No hissing, plenty of bass response. It does not sound as good as a CD or a direct cable connection, however.I connected the module to be used as my SAT (I don't subscribe to Satellite radio.) I wanted to keep AUX available for cable connections, and still be able to play CDs.Bluetooth pairs fairly quickly, but you have to be quick: have your device ready to be paired, THEN turn on the radio on SAT (or wherever your Bluetooth module is configured to connect to.) This will then pair the device. If you miss the pairing, simply switch to another channel (AM/FM/CD), and back, and it'll attempt to pair again.The Number 2 key on the stereo acts as Pause/Play, the Track Up/Down is for switching songs, and the Number 6 key is used to control the iPod by Voice. The Steering wheel controls work too.I decided not to use this kit for pairing with my phone. Let's say you are listening to the Radio, and your phone receives a call. Unlike what's mentioned in the product description, the radio did NOT switch to SAT/Bluetooth to take the call. I had the same problem with the BT35-TOY, and didn't bother to troubleshoot it beyond what I had already checked.However, if your phone IS paired, and you leave your radio on SAT/Bluetooth, it does take calls well. Sound quality was decent and the other party could not tell that I was on Bluetooth.The microphone can be moved around easily, and the manual even gives you some guidance on how to reroute it to your rear view mirror. I opted to leave the microphone hidden in the dash for now (again, I do not use the phone functionality.)It paired well with my iPod Touch 5th generation, 4th generation; Samsung Galaxy S3, Google Nexus 7; Laptop equipped with Bluetooth.Please keep in mind that if you are watching movies or play games, there is a slight delay of what you see on the screen and what is heard. So, if you plan on playing games (passengers, not drivers!), this product's delay is disappointing. For movies, it's somewhat... with some reservations... acceptable. I'd recommend using the AUX audio cable for watching movies in the car instead.In the end, I am fairly happy with this kit, and because it is modular, I know that I can add other functions in the future as needed.EDIT 4/25/14: I recently got a ""NOT AVAIL"" message on my car display while trying to pair Bluetooth with my new phone. I initially wasn't sure if my new phone was to blame, but the iSimple wouldn't pair with my iPod either. I immediately went to look for instructions on how to reset the iSimple. I suspected that there were too many devices paired with the product, and I'd either have to reset it, or remove devices from its pairing table. The manual was a bit difficult to understand, but I eventually figured it out, and am now sharing my findings here.1. One method to reset the iSimple is to disconnect it from the radio overnight. However, I did not want to open up the car and do so.2. This method allowed me to adjust many iSimple settings:a. Hit the ""3"" button. This changes the display to ""Settings"".b. Hit the Tune Up button. It'll now show ""BT Search"". Keep hitting the Seek/Track Up button to cycle through the choices, including ""Devices"", and ""Remove"".c. To select an item, hit the ""3"" button. Cycle through the choices via the Seek/Track Up button again.d. I removed all paired devices until none was left. I was now successfully able to pair my new phone to the radio, and everything was working fine again.e. If you don't want to make a selection, simply wait a few seconds, and the menu will exit itself.You may also adjust the speaker, microphone, and other volume settings by cycling through the Settings screen. On my car, everything was set at ""12"". This probably is the default setting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTXRO5QVYD9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZYRFPG#wasThisHelpful","RSTXRO5QVYD9U","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I couldn't be happier with the PAC system. See my review of it here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N38VYVE7XMN2/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HMC6DQ&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D4IBEIN4XNQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WC9B2I#wasThisHelpful","R1D4IBEIN4XNQO","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never installed any internal after-market products in my car before (with exception of a trailer hitch). I went to ToyotaNation.com and YouTube to find how-to's, and found one thread with pictures at ToyotaNation.com for a similar Toyota Highlander. This helped guide me enough to give me the courage to open up my car panel and work on the audio system.I had purchased the USA SPEC BT35-TOY Bluetooth module for my Toyota Highlander 2008 Sport and was thoroughly dissatisfied with that product's poor sound quality. It had no bass oomph.So, I took a chance and purchased this PAC product. It was easy enough to install. The iPod cable is thick and solid, and although it worked with my iPod Touch 4th generation, I have since bought the 5th generation with the Lightning connector. You have to purchase a 30-pin-to-Lightning adapter if you want to continue using it. However, keep in mind that the adapter is only useful for CHARGING your iPod. Audio would not play through it. Bluetooth, which is what I bought this kit for, would be the only connectivity option.I also purchased the Bluetooth add-on module (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZYRFPG/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_86), and this review is mostly about that functionality.Sound quality is superb through Bluetooth! Much, much better than the BT-35. No hissing, plenty of bass response. It does not sound as good as a CD or a direct cable connection, however.I connected the module to be used as my SAT (I don't subscribe to Satellite radio.) I wanted to keep AUX available for cable connections, and still be able to play CDs.Bluetooth pairs fairly quickly, but you have to be quick: have your device ready to be paired, THEN turn on the radio on SAT (or wherever your Bluetooth module is configured to connect to.) This will then pair the device. If you miss the pairing, simply switch to another channel (AM/FM/CD), and back, and it'll attempt to pair again.The Number 2 key on the stereo acts as Pause/Play, the Track Up/Down is for switching songs, and the Number 6 key is used to control the iPod by Voice. The Steering wheel controls work too.I decided not to use this kit for pairing with my phone. Let's say you are listening to the Radio, and your phone receives a call. Unlike what's mentioned in the product description, the radio did NOT switch to SAT/Bluetooth to take the call. I had the same problem with the BT35-TOY, and didn't bother to troubleshoot it beyond what I had already checked.However, if your phone IS paired, and you leave your radio on SAT/Bluetooth, it does take calls well. Sound quality was decent and the other party could not tell that I was on Bluetooth.The microphone can be moved around easily, and the manual even gives you some guidance on how to reroute it to your rear view mirror. I opted to leave the microphone hidden in the dash for now (again, I do not use the phone functionality.)It paired well with my iPod Touch 5th generation, 4th generation; Samsung Galaxy S3, Google Nexus 7; Laptop equipped with Bluetooth.Please keep in mind that if you are watching movies or play games, there is a slight delay of what you see on the screen and what is heard. So, if you plan on playing games (passengers, not drivers!), this product's delay is disappointing. For movies, it's somewhat... with some reservations... acceptable. I'd recommend using the AUX audio cable for watching movies in the car instead.In the end, I am fairly happy with this kit, and because it is modular, I know that I can add other functions in the future as needed.EDIT 4/25/14: I recently got a ""NOT AVAIL"" message on my car display while trying to pair Bluetooth with my new phone. I initially wasn't sure if my new phone was to blame, but the iSimple wouldn't pair with my iPod either. I immediately went to look for instructions on how to reset the iSimple. I suspected that there were too many devices paired with the product, and I'd either have to reset it, or remove devices from its pairing table. The manual was a bit difficult to understand, but I eventually figured it out, and am now sharing my findings here.1. One method to reset the iSimple is to disconnect it from the radio overnight. However, I did not want to open up the car and do so.2. This method allowed me to adjust many iSimple settings:a. Hit the ""3"" button. This changes the display to ""Settings"".b. Hit the Tune Up button. It'll now show ""BT Search"". Keep hitting the Seek/Track Up button to cycle through the choices, including ""Devices"", and ""Remove"".c. To select an item, hit the ""3"" button. Cycle through the choices via the Seek/Track Up button again.d. I removed all paired devices until none was left. I was now successfully able to pair my new phone to the radio, and everything was working fine again.e. If you don't want to make a selection, simply wait a few seconds, and the menu will exit itself.You may also adjust the speaker, microphone, and other volume settings by cycling through the Settings screen. On my car, everything was set at ""12"". This probably is the default setting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N38VYVE7XMN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HMC6DQ#wasThisHelpful","R1N38VYVE7XMN2","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm normally a fan of Griffin case protector products, but this time I decided to take a chance and purchase a less pricey one. It shipped fast and fits my iPod Touch 5th generation very well. The clear rubber looks just like the clear one pictured here (frosty, not glass-clear.) I decided to take advantage of this see-through cover by placing a small label at the back with my contact information in case I lose the iPod and a good Samaritan finds it (one can only hope!)The case is NOT non-slip, but when pitted against other rubber, it doesn't slip as much as a case made entirely of plastic.The case sufficiently covers the face of the iPod without adding much bulk. It's slim and should provide sufficient protection from minor drops.The only concern I have is the protection of the bottom portion of the iPod's face (where the button is located). The case does not extend much there -- iPod is nearly flush with the case at that area.Nonetheless, I am happy with the purchase.UPDATE 4/25/14: the case has turned a yellow tint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R362D0BREONSDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009PFE142#wasThisHelpful","R362D0BREONSDG","AYRAS2X1L4WNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYRAS2X1L4WNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My television has been at a spot in my apartment that receives very poor television reception. At most, I only received 3 of the mainstream channels, and so I decided to purchase this product.It has a well-written manual, along with tips on how to mount the antenna in various scenarios. I opted to hang it along my wall way above the television at a 45 degree angle (it didn't work well at that one spot vertically or horizontally.)It hides well (you can put it behind a picture frame), and most importantly: it picked up SO MANY channels, I consistently receive comments from visitors about how many my TV can catch.

There are several modes you can activate (manual was easy to read), including cycling/rejuvinating the batteries.

"I purchased this during a Gold Box deal.

It also works with USB 2.0 (most common type today).Product has a small hole for you to loop a holder through, and I wished that they had provided such string.Nonetheless, it's fast, looks decent, and doesn't require a separate cap to protect the USB connector.

"This is a breakthrough for drinking a glass of quality wine without opening the bottle.The Coravin system ingeniously punctures the (real) cork with a needle and injects inert Argon gas  to create pressure.  This pressure forces out as much wine as needed but leaves behind an inert Noble gas that doesn't affect the wine.  In essence, it's as if the bottle was never opened even after removing a serving.Obviously, this is not intended for inexpensive wine that you would drink in a few days; rather; it's intended for wines that are special that you might just want one glass of and the put back into storage.  We all have those special bottles pf wine that we don't wan't to fininsh in one sittting and the Coravin lets us do that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R272J18496MFY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168AT5HE#wasThisHelpful","R272J18496MFY6","A3F3B1JPACN215","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F3B1JPACN215?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After years of trying new brands of dry foods for my 17 year old DLH, there has been a recent explosion of premium dry grain and gluten free cat foods coming onto the market recently and they're expensive compared to those 40 pound bags/buckets,Initially my cat didn't like the high-protein grain-free foods so I mixed in with food he liked to wean him off of it. Grains have been replaced by peas and potatoes so there are vegetables in the recipe.  My cat is older now so I want him to have a better diet and Solid Gold Nature's Harmony Chicken, Peas & Potato Grain Free Kitten & Adult Cat Food has been one of his morning meals.

After reviewing my last premium cat dry food that my cat wouldn't even touch, I called the manufacturer and learned that cats that are used to eating lower quality cat foods often won't eat the high-protein grain-free dry cat foods.I mix a little more in with his food each time and now my cat likes these types of cat foods. My cat prefers seafood so this blend was to his liking.This comes in a very sparkly bag so it would stand out on a pet store shelf.  It is grain and gluten free.  I would order this again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JDBN6HBEGBRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GTKQG#wasThisHelpful","R3JDBN6HBEGBRY","A3F3B1JPACN215","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F3B1JPACN215?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Every single piece of the faucet's hardware -- the stuff you don't see -- just feels like it's quality made when you're holding it and installing it.Installation is a breeze thanks to the flexible steel water supply lines.

"Ringside is really making some great boxing products at very reasonable prices.  This heavy bag is very well constructed from leather and comes filled.  An unfilled version is available.The package includes: the chain and swivel for hanging, heavy-duty riveted straps, and a D-ring on the bottom so it can be attached to the floor.  (I attached min to the floor with a strong bungee cord.)  The bag comes in either red or black.There is a 1"" foam liner that protects your hand from impacting the stuffing directly and also helps the bag hold its shape.If I could only have four pieces of boxing gear they would be: boxing gloves, a heavy bag, a speed bag and a jump rope.

"A breakthrough in circular polarizers from B&W transmits 100% more light.  Most circular polarizers (including my other B&W brand) take away two full stops.  That means that when I put one on my f2.8 lens it becomes a f5.6.  With this new Multi-Resistant Nano Coated Circular Polarizer from B&W, it only takes away one stop so my lens shoots at f4.0.This polarizer uses the XS-Pro mount which has the same threads as the standard F mount but it is thinner and uses thinner glass for superior light transmission.I tested this on my Nikon D810 with my Nikon 24-70mm f2.8 and the results were comparable to the standard B&W F mount circular polarizer.  I'll be using this one from now on and retiring the older one.I can't express enough how important gaining a full stop back from the polarizer is.  This is truly a breakthrough by B&W and a worthy compliment to my high-quality camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UGKCOE9NZ6BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OK6YSAS#wasThisHelpful","R2UGKCOE9NZ6BX","A3F3B1JPACN215","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F3B1JPACN215?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This mug is a nice addition to my extensive collection of insulated stainless steel flasks.  As such. It has some competition dating back over a decade.I like this mug because it holds 2 cups (16 ounces or about 1/2 liter) and it's leak-proof.  As with all mug of this type, they insulate cold better than hot.  It has to do with the difference between ambient room temperature and the temperature of the contents, The bigger the difference, the less effective the thermal barrier is and steel conducts heat fro, the interior to the exterior on all of these mugs.I don't need my hot beverages to stay hot for more than a few hours so if this can do that (and it does) that's perfect.  My iced drinks have ice the next day after I leave them out overnight so I'd say that claim is verified.  My coffee stayed warmish for about 3-4 hours but was far from piping hot.This is not Aladdin from 50 years ago but it's well made and dishwasher safe.I love the feel of metal in my hand an the ergonomic shape fits well in my palm.

"This lamp is really well made with a heavy base and strong articulated joints.  It uses an ultra-modern design so the lamp doesn't look conventional.Here's what I liked:* The base is heavy so the lamp stays in place* The joints are articulated and can be tightened with the included Allen wrench (built into the base) if they become loose* The LED light is white and has 3 dimming levels.  At the highest level, it is very bright.* The USB port is strong enough to charge my iPad which needs at least 2.1A so it's powerful.  The USB port is more useful than I expected it to be.Here's is what I would have done differently:* The shiny plastic used picks up fingerprints.  I would have preferred a matte finish.* The power supply is a box-type external DC transformer.  I would have preferred a normal lamp cord with the transformer built into the base.* The lamp only has 3 dimming levels.  I find the lowest level to be to bright for night time use so I would have preferred 2 more lower light levels* The lamp head does not rotate.  This is my biggest issue because I can't aim the light -- it is always projecting straight down (or parallel to the arm).Despite my minor differences in design choices; I still think this is an awesome lamp and I'm looking at the other similar B&D models to see if I can find one where the lamp head offers a bit more adjustment and a couple of more light levels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1266GELHUUESW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW76VW#wasThisHelpful","R1266GELHUUESW","A3F3B1JPACN215","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F3B1JPACN215?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This PowerGlide 1534 cordless vacuum cleaner from Bissell works better than I expected.  I'm using it with the brush spinning in high speed at all times.Unboxing and assembly was easy.  The directions consist of six steps and assume that you can figure out how to charge the battery and open the cover to insert it.  Here's the list...Pros:* Easy assembly* Fast charging battery* Bagless design - I WILL NOT buy a vacuum cleaner that uses bags ever again.  I have another cordless vacuum cleaner (the H brand) that takes bags and I NEVER use it.* Powerful suction - Worked well on carpets and hard floors* Swivel head - This is new to me and I really like it.  It make the unit easy to maneuver with a twist of the wrist.* Removable base - When using the wand; the base can be disconnected to reduce weight* Multi-purpose accessory attachment - Neat attachment that has both a slim tip and a brush tip in oneCons:* Manual switch between floor and wand - There is a switch on the side of the body that has to be rotated to direct the suction to either the wand or the floor.* No edge suction - None was expected* A piece of plastic fell out when I was assembling it.  I hope it wasn't important.* Has a consumer-feel; but, to be fair, it's a consumer product and it comes with a 2 year limited warranty (keep your receipt)All things considered; the PowerGlide 1534 is going to be my daily vacuum cleaner and I'll take out my heavy corded vacuum cleaner when needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23E5X7NG9GVYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012S2118C#wasThisHelpful","R23E5X7NG9GVYH","A3F3B1JPACN215","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F3B1JPACN215?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been an owner of the Bose QC-15's since 2011 and couldn't be happier with the product. Personally, it doesn't bother me that they are battery powered. I was excited, however, to see that Bose had a cheaper, non-electronic, over-ear headphones. I have been in a pinch where I couldn't use my QC-15's because I didn't have batteries.These are really solid headphones! Though they are not electronic noise canceling headphones, they still suppress a lot of noise. The sound quality is solid and the bass is just as good as the QC-15. It is apparent, however, that the build quality is not as excellent as the QC-15's. I expected this with the price reduction, though. I don't feel that these headphones are overly cheap or lack significant quality, but it is worth noting that these are not powerless QC-15's.So far, I have used these for listening to music, making phone calls on my iPhone 6, and playing PlayStation. These function as a great headset for gaming because the sound is immersive and much of the external noise is suppressed. I am satisfied with this product and will continue to support Bose products if they continue to possess high-quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I58WK1ZKTU3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RFX38#wasThisHelpful","R1I58WK1ZKTU3E","A3F3B1JPACN215","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F3B1JPACN215?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I put one of these on every body I own because I'm a ""better safe than sorry"" kind of person.This tether kit doesn't look like much and depending upon your needs can be enough for two bodies.  The idea is that you attach the tethers where you would normally attach the shoulder strap.  The one on the left (from the back) is attached to the Black Rapid sling screwed into the tripod base of the camera.  If that base ever became unscrewed, the tether would save the camera.  If you didn't have a tether, your camera would go to ground.The second tether is optional and depends upon your shooting style.  I tend not to install this one unless I know I'm going to need it because it gets in the way of my gripping hand and if my camera is clipped to my belt, it isn't exactly ""Rapid"" to draw and shoot a picture because I have to unclip it first.  That said;  I just used the second tether yesterday because I was climbing on rocky terrain and I didn't want the camera swinging around but that's more of an exception for me.For what you get, I think this kit is overpriced so I taking off a star.

I bought two of these for my wider lenses.  The 70mm-200mm f2.8 doesn't need one because it has a darkening effect on the sky around the edges.

"I rarely write product reviews but the amount of money and shipping I paid for this item requires action.I fell for the line that Mayo Clinic endorsed this lotion and am now taking some of my very precious time to disclose that this product is useless. I should have been happy with the awesome Banana Boat Deep Dark Color Self Tanning lotion I've used for the past year but I read an online review and excitedly purchased this product. Now I feel like a chump, am 53.00 lighter, and my face broke out because this product contains oil. I used it for two weeks to test the color application and there wasn't a significant change in color or tone to my skin.I am editing my review for this morning I found myself wondering just how is it that Mayo endorsed this lotion? I'm such a chump! I KNOW BETTER: Non-profit organizations are not in the business of product endorsement. Notice how it reads as a Mayo endorsement? It doesn't quote a specific physician referral or reference a clinic test.I'm a former Director of a non-profit and know the ropes* so I went searching, landed on Mayo's site, and read this: ""Mayo Clinic maintains a distinct separation between advertising content and editorial content. All advertising content on Mayo Clinic's health information website or in one of our newsletters is clearly labeled as an advertisement""Don't waste your money with this product and its disingenuous marketing and allow me to tell you how to achieve a great lotion tan. Use the Banana Boat product which you can buy at Target (where it's cheaper than Walgreens).  While in the shower use baking soda or a scrub brush to prepare your skin. Baking soda is a great exfoliate. I use it as a scrub for my face. I also use it under my arms because it absorbs orders and I'm at the gym everyday.Once dry, apply the Banana Boat Deep Dark Color. The lotion works better than the spray and it's more cost effective. I'm not orange, there's a very mild inoffensive odor, and the lotion is tinted which helps with application. I use it on my arms, neck, (don't neglect the back of your neck), chest, and face. I apply it to my legs in the summer. It seemed pointless to apply it to my legs this winter when everything was covered due to the severe cold. Allow the lotion to dry on your skin 5 mins (while brushing your teeth. Rinse your mouth with baking soda, it will make your breath fresh!)before putting on your socks or other tight clothing which will make the color uneven. Especially socks.I've never had a break out occur on my face when using this product. A light sheen presents which I remove with a oil control film. Clean and Clear makes the film product that I use to remove the sheen from my face and its a great product for oily skin. It doesn't remove makeup just the oil slick on your face. I also use a soapy nail brush on my palms and under my finger nails after I've applied the lotion. It will stain your hands if you don't scrub your palms and under your nails.I haven't worn makeup in years which is why I use the tanning lotion. My women friends, people at the gym, and strangers always tell me I look healthy.The difference in price is awesomeness. The Banana Boat Summer Color is in a 6 ounce tube, lasts for four to five months, and is less than 10.00 with tax.Choose wisely and follow my research. It's YOUR hard earned money. Ask yourself why you want to believe the hype. I've reflected on this and decided I really thought this would be better. Too bad for me since my system already worked really well. As my Mother used to say, If it isn't broke don't fix it. Also? You may want to consider those glowing reviews of this product were provided by those who have an investment in it.Loreal makes a bronzing lotion that has glitter in it. Avoid that too because as the lotion drys the glitter will be on your clothing. I had a small pile under my desk.* I've come back to edit my review because I've just read some comments from people wondering why I wrote about ""cred"". I didn't realize some many people weren't aware of how a non-profit organization operates. I hope this is easy to grasp for those who don't have any exposure or experience. Non-profits receive funding from various and often divergent sources. FOR THAT REASON they cannot endorse a product. This was my sole point for mentioning I'm a former Director of one: I knew better had I reflected.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R58XKR9WDXV5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOXX5YM#wasThisHelpful","R58XKR9WDXV5X","A3COJCZ53RAUC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3COJCZ53RAUC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been purchasing Kind Bars for almost two years. They are my morning snack with coffee. Two months ago I was eating a Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew Kind Bar when I chipped my front lower tooth of a piece of cherry pit.I wasn't expecting to encounter something rock hard in a chewy bar. An added complication - the chipped tooth was cutting my inside lower lip when eating - was that I had knee replacement surgery scheduled within two weeks of the tooth being chipped. I had to scramble to get a dentist appointment and have it fixed prior to surgery. I was told during my pre-surgery interview that any teeth issues had to be resolved prior to surgery. After knee replacement dental surgery is not an option for 1.5 years. Not even a teeth cleaning is allowed because of the risk of infection which can attack the implant in the knee.Six weeks after surgery I was eating another Kind bar when I bit down into a whole cherry pit. This bar (two different batch numbers) cracked a porcelain crown and I went back to the dentist. Luckily for me and Kind, the repair did not require dental surgery. My dentist was able to 'polish' the crown back into use.Driving to the Dentist five weeks after surgery was an anxious experience. I'm appalled was that Kind was not responsive to my email. Initially I wanted to return the wrapper with the pit to them. ""Cherries aren't in season in Feb"" I explained to the man at Kind who called me responding to my email (meaning I didn't get the pit from some place other than the Kind Bar and I wasn't trying to run a scam on Kind. Naomi from his insurance company (CNA) called me. Even though she taped the conversation her claim denial letter said I no longer had the pit in my possession so I couldn't be reimbursed for my trip to the dentist. I still have the pit. I have not been reimbursed for anything although Kind sent two replacement boxes. Two measly boxes. Unbelievable.Where was the real KINDness during this experience? It was from my dentist who understood I was having knee surgery and agreed to see me on short notice. Twice.Anyone have recommendations for other bars?","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI2AVI0ERENQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JKTTUA#wasThisHelpful","RI2AVI0ERENQY","A3COJCZ53RAUC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3COJCZ53RAUC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read Captiva last month and decided Randy Wayne White doesn't like women. I tried to ignore this and ordered Sanibal Flats which I'm currently trying to read without tossing. Good thing I bought the paperback, it will have a new (and brief) life in the recycle bin.On page 70 of Sanibel Flats: ""He (ford) had always avoided promiscuous women and would have probably avoided Sally had he known in advance."" By page 77 he's having sex with two women in one day (and bragging about the 'multiple times'). Double Standard, Mr. White? Or maybe the editor called in sick that day?There's also a dissing comment about feminists which had me rolling my eyes. Mr. White, the goal of feminism is that everyone benefits.I chose to read these books wanting to read about the flora and fauna of this part of Florida. What am insulting waste of my precious time.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A0JFN7I8QVUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312926022#wasThisHelpful","R2A0JFN7I8QVUR","A3COJCZ53RAUC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3COJCZ53RAUC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Amazing sound quality and very easy setup to both my bluetooth phone and my TV.  I don't really know what to say about this product other than it is amazing.  I have it set up to my TV right now as my sound system.  It was awesome for Sunday Football day!The set up was as easy as can be.  Held my phone up to the speaker and instantly set it up.  No problems at all.  I also set it up to my TV using a simple HDMI-ARC cord.  Couldn't be easier!The speaker is heavy, so don't look for this to be an easy carry along.  It is definitely portable, but it is heavier than I thought it would be and a bit larger than anticipated.  It doesn't have a remote, either, so make sure that you set it up somewhere where you can easily get to it to adjust the sounds.I love the way this sounds outside as well.  The sound resonates throughout the wind!  Classical music on the deck with a glass of wine for me and a cigar for my husband and a fire in the pit.  Perfect fall evening.Excellent Bluetooth sound speaker!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TCFZ3W98ONBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JFMLS0#wasThisHelpful","R2TCFZ3W98ONBX","A2PL0US7RN67G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PL0US7RN67G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this projector!  It is very compact and super simple to use and set up.  All of the ports are simple to get too and all of the buttons, start, lamp, menu, home, etc. are on the face top.  I easily connected my BluRay player and my sound bar to watch a great movie with friends.  The color was amazing and even though the room wasn't  pitch black, the picture quality was perfect and everyone could easily see the picture.  The 3000 lumens Color Brightness and the 3000 White Brightness worked beautifully in a semi dark room.  I imagine in a dark room it is even more spectacular.  I do wish that this projector was equipped with an internal dvd player, but being so simple to set up the bluray player and my laptop, it isn't that much of a drag at all.  I did play around with the image adjustments and found them also easy to use.Honesly, this really is a plug and play theater system as well as a plug and play office projector.  It is so lightweight that carrying it from room to room and setting up to the office computer/laptop for display was quick.  I did a presentation for a group of people with this projector during the day...perfect.Right now, I am using it consistently as a home theater.  I have it set up to my Soundbar, my BluRay player and a screen that comes down from ceiling.  I'm planning on hosting a football party using this projector and my laptop and of course, Sunday Ticket!  Hopefully I win my fantasy football that day!  Seriously, this is an all around perfect projector for home or office, inside or outside.  Perfect!There is also a remote that does everything from wherever you are.  Love that.  There is also telephone and internet support services if needed.  So there are no worries at all if you have any problems with set up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FCVHENHASMDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119FYO74#wasThisHelpful","R1FCVHENHASMDM","A2PL0US7RN67G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PL0US7RN67G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need to first start out by saying that Lynn Cullen wrote a fascinating book.  Her writing style is unique in the fact that she is able to tell a story based on research and make it sound like a novel rather than a biography.  Her attention to detail and her descriptions of the era, people, places and the general tone of the times is impeccable.  Although, for me it was rather slow, being someone who prefers a quicker storyline, but  for a person who desires that type of attention it is perfect.  She obviously loves her craft.I wanted to read this book because I always found the differences between Samuel Clemens and Mark Twain disturbing.  Before Samuel became ""Mark Twain"" he was a small time newspaper writer who wrote a scathing editorial about a competitors editor and owner of another newspaper.  Apparently Mr. Clemens had a big mouth and loved to hide behind pen and paper.  However, this time the owner of the rival paper decided to take him to task and decided a duel would be best.  Long story short, Mr. Clemens ran away and became Mark Twain.  After reading about this I took an interest in Mr.Clemens and the duality of personalities he created.This book, Twain's End, takes place many, many years later after  fully becoming Mark Twain to the public while being Samuel Clemens while alone at home.  Towards  the end of his wife's life (sickly) and during a great financial crisis, Miss Lyons was brought in to be secretary to Olivia Clemens.  She became ""family"" thru thick and thin and more.  She was everything and more to the family...except she wasn't family.There is a bit of interest between the Helen Keller and Mary Sullivan and Mary's husband, but the story stays pretty close to Isabel Lyons and the relationship between her and Samuel as well as Samuel's daughter.  Isabel never seemed to catch a break from her young life until her death.  Tragic, in my opinion, the life of this poor woman who found herself caring for a narcissistic, egotistical ""little man"", his wife, his daughter and finally finding some sort of love with Mr Clemens associate.  Until of course, Mr. Clemens and his daughter decided to use pen and paper to destroy her.For me, It is a heartbreaking story.  Not because Isabel fell in love with a man that wouldn't be able to ever love her.  Not because his daughter, even though she hated the man, was a wretched human towards Isabel and not even because by the time she did find someone who would love her she was so betrayed by the ""family"" she believed she was part of.  No, this is heartbreaking because Samuel Clemens was a jerk.  A jerk in all sense of the word.  Samuel Clemens wasn't fit to be Mark Twain.  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde hidden behind a Connecticut ""Great American Author and Humorist.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQZXBB6LT3IG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476758964#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQZXBB6LT3IG","A2PL0US7RN67G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PL0US7RN67G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There isn't really much to say about the benefits of coconut oil to someone who is looking at this product.  You already know or you wouldn't be looking.  What I can say is the quality of Nauture's Answer is outstanding.  I have tried many products which are all good, but this one seems to work better.  I sent some off to college with my 22 year old son to help him with the remaining few stress classes and he instantly felt better.  His hair and nails were finally healthy again.  His gums weren't bleeding and he ate less junk.  For me, I feel alive.  My menopause symptoms are reduced, my hair is full and my skin is gorgeous.

"This is an amazing book.  I am so taken away by the power of the message, the love in the words and the light in the story.  I realize that may sound very corny, but it is exactly how I feel about this book.  I admit that I didn't understand what this book was about when I picked it up, I thought that maybe it was a book about people's experiences when they return to the other side.  What it turned out to be is an amazing story about how the author began her journey into the ""craziness"" and spiral into the abyss of the other side, the unknown or whatever it is called.  It is about a young girl trying to fit in, a young women trying to understand and then crossing boundaries in experimenting with her gifts, running away from and then reconciliation of these spectacular gifts.I cried very often thru this book.  Her stories are very similar to mine.  Her anger and sadness, angst and fear as well as the successes and the elatedness of helping others.  I cried for her, the people, her family...everyone.  It touched me deeply.This is a story...not a self help book or a ""wisdom from the other side"" book.  It is a story/biography of sorts about opening up to what frightens us the most.  I loved this book and I know you will too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVJMP1R0HP6AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998383#wasThisHelpful","RVJMP1R0HP6AB","A2PL0US7RN67G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PL0US7RN67G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very quality blender.  It is much easier to get a mid or lower blend speed than the two other blenders I own.  The easy turn knob makes getting the perfect speed for delicate veggies like spinach and kale to blend without too much over blend and carrots and beets on a higher speed to blend quick and easily.  The Jamba blender is much better and giving me a super clean blend without any seeds, stems, etc.. simply smooth smoothies!  It will pulverize all the ice, fruits and veggies to perfection for your daily use. I love the looks of the blender.  It is a very nice color with a great tight look that blends easily on my counter.  It isn't huge.  I like that.  There are two different size jars.  32 oz and 16oz for easy use, both with their own blades.  That is awesome in my book.  Changing blades is a bear and this doesn't make me do that so yeah, AWESOME!  It has all the bells and whistles as much larger and more expensive blenders with a much nicer look and a much easier clean up.  Everything is removable and dishwasher safe for super easy cleaning especially when running out the door first thing in the morning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10BIRGCXGZ2TZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PAJUEA#wasThisHelpful","R10BIRGCXGZ2TZ","A2PL0US7RN67G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PL0US7RN67G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so very disappointed in this device.  I was so excited to be able to test this out, but after a few days, I have decided that it isn't worth the annoyance.  The set up for me was easy, it synced just fine using my android phone.  I had no issues installing the battery or following the almost non existent instructions.  I didn't sync to a scale, but everything I did sync to was perfect so I can assume with confidence that syncing isn't a problem with my android phone.  I added my weight, desired steps, desired weight, sleep time, etc.. with ease.The watch itself is comfortable to wear, light weight and water proof.  I know it is waterproof because I forgot to take it off while power washing my house and it was just fine.All sounds great EXCEPT...  The user face is so ridiculous to use!  It is so very non responsive!  It takes at least 10 tries to get just the time to show on the face and when something finally displays it takes another ten swipes to get it to go to something different.  It is really an annoyance and for me, it doesn't matter how accurate the device is, (and it does seem to be very accurate), the fact that it is ridiculous to ""turn on"" is a real game breaker.  I find myself getting to the point where I want to toss the watch to get it to work.  If this problem can be fixed, then I will happily give it 5 stars.  Until then, it is mediocre at best.****UPDATE****I have used this watch daily for well over 3 weeks and I have found it to be extremely accurate.  Yes, I have two different meters to check for accuracy.  It is super comfortable and looks great.  However, I still just don't like the slow return on the userface.  I am constantly getting frustrated when trying to look at any of the information.  I think this is a top notch system, but needs to have something done about this one issue.****UPDATE***The company, Nuyu responded to this review with a fix to the user face.  On the app there is a reset button for the Touch Sensor and now the device is working very, very well.  As reviewed earlier, this is the only issue that was a problem/annoyance for me and now it is working perfectly.

"This game was a great time. The rules were clear and simple, so we were able to set up and play with very little delay. Each planeswalker and the squads they controlled had a very unique feel and flavor, surprisingly close to how the colors feel in magic two. White was all about strength in numbers and defensive tactics. Blue was battlefield manipulation and mind control effects. Black was straight murder, sacrifice, and reanimation. Red was very aggressive combat strategies, and green was simply making things big and optimized movement.We are looking forward to continue playing this game. Its customization options--choosing different characters and armies to play with, as well as the ability to create new maps and play with different glyphs--means that it is unlikely to get boring. Also, some of the wording on the cards hints that expansions are to come, leading to actual deck building and different strategies.This game is definitely worth it for any Magic the Gathering or tabletop game fan. As of now, it is a very simple game, and I can ever play with friends who have no previous Magic the Gathering knowledge, but as expansions are released, this game will be a blast to play for board game night consistently.On a final note, there was definitely a lot of thought and care put into the creation of this game.  This is not a quick ""money maker"" magic game that was put out for name only.  It is a great game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5BKFODGNYWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJGCRA#wasThisHelpful","R3S5BKFODGNYWA","A2PL0US7RN67G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PL0US7RN67G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This great water bottle has become my daily companion!  It holds a full 24oz, doesnt' leak and doesn't spill down your chin when you take a huge gulp!  I make it my goal to drink at least half of my body weight in ounces of water every day so having a really good water bottle is a necessity for me.  This one is perfect.  Easy to carry around either in my hand or purse or back pack without fear of it spilling everywhere thanks to the lock top.  It isn't flimsy and cheap feeling and as I've already stated, holds a good amount of water.  If you are looking for an all around water bottle, this is the one. I didn't feel that it was too heavy or bulky like some reviewers, but, I am not a huge hiker, so I don't know if it would be bothersome on a hike or not.For me and what I need it for I can say that I  Love it and I really love the color!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PSSUM4XVB04S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYBBYN8#wasThisHelpful","R1PSSUM4XVB04S","A2PL0US7RN67G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PL0US7RN67G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't believe I am not giving this bar 5 stars.  I LOVE Food Should Taste Good products.  I am a sesame and chocolate bar nut so seeing this new Food bar made me jump for joy.  Until I tasted it.  Not for me.  It didn't have that same ""Oh my gosh, this is delicious"" taste that all the other bars I eat do.  It has a funky aftertaste that lingered for a good 15 minutes or so.  Almost like a fake syrupy flavor. The nuts were very, very soft and the chocolate not at all rich and satisfying.  Usually these bars are crisp, tasty and filling, but this one, for me, didn't make the cut.  I asked my son to give it a taste and he said the same thing..not at all like the others.  We actually ended up not eating it all and throwing it away.

"The Lenovo C40 21.5 inch All-in-One Touchscreen is the first All in One I have ever used or owned and I have to say that I am overwhelmed by the shear brilliance of this design.  For the past few years I have been looking at All in One's and always opted for the laptop (Lenovo Yoga and Lenovo Flex as well as Lenovo Tablet) as well as a bulky tower desktop believing that the tower is the ONLY way to go for home and office use.  Yup, I'm an idiot.  A reformed idiot.This All-in-One is simply amazing.  I literally unpacked it, put it on my small home office desk and plugged it in.  I didn't even need a screw driver because Lenovo has brilliantly designed the back with screws that twist without any tools!  Yes!  Easy set up...no tools, no instructions, no worries!  When or if I need to update / upgrade, all I will have to do is take off the back, add the new equipment and pop the back piece back on and done.  It takes up very little space on my desk, and believe me, my personal work space is super small desk at the foot of my bed, so sleek and slim are exactly what I need.  The screen sits on a corner fitted foot and moves forward and back.  Perfect.This is a 10-point Multi-touch display which offers a simple and optimized way to use Windows 8, which I know very well and haven't had any issues with at all.It has Integrated AMD Radeon R series HD graphics, stereo speakers with Dolby Advanced Audio and HDMI-in.  I don't have a clue to what that really means in hard core computer talk, but I know that listening to Amazon Prime Stations while I work is incredible.  The sound is so crisp and clear.  I admit that my jaw dropped when I first heard James Taylor belt out ""Sweet Baby James"".  I also was totally fascinated by the picture quality of my Netflix fave ""House of Cards"".  Simply amazing.  I just turn the screen towards my bed and instant entertainment.  Hush...I know what you are thinking... It is equipped with a 6 in 1 Media Card reader which apparently supports tons of cards, but as I am not a gamer and don't know the first thing about this aspect I decided to call upon my  son,  who is a Digital Arts and Science Major, to the task of game playing and reviewing.  He easily downloaded a few of his games and played them for much longer than I thought necessary, but he claimed he needed to really get a good feel for the game play.  Please!  He loved the graphics, sound and the play itself.  No drag or hang ups that he could find.  He is also now hounding me to put this computer in our family office as it is ""the ideal Family All-In-One PC"".  Not happening.  Mine.It comes with a very receptive keyboard and mouse making this truly an All-in-One PC.The operating system is 8.1 and has 2 USB 3.0 ports.  It has a 2 TB Hard Drive, 8 GB DDR3 RAM and a 2.2 GHz A-Series Quad -Core A Processor.  Max Screen Resolution is 1920x1080 Pixels and the Graphics Coprocessor is Integrated.  There is also an DVDRW Optical Drive.It is also equipped with Bluetooth and a 720 webcam for pictures or video chat.  I use Skype and tried it out with my daughter and it worked perfectly.  I have also used an external DVD player which, not at all surprisingly, worked fantastic with the PC.  I have not been able to sync my bluetooth, but from everything I have read, it is a Windows 8.1 issue and just have to download a driver.  I'm not going to set it up because the Amazon Prime Stations and Pandora are perfect for my music needs and Skype works perfect for chat.Also, it does come with an Ethernet port for wired connections, but I use wireless.  Again, no issues.  Perfect execution of all of my sites and pages.I hope I was able to portray the ease, beauty and power that this All-in-One PC has.  It is truly the best PC I have used.  It replaces the bulky tower and my laptops.  Great addition to my Lenovo ""family"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26KJNDX59MB7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WR285U6#wasThisHelpful","R26KJNDX59MB7U","A2PL0US7RN67G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PL0US7RN67G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really, really like this ring.  The platinum plating is gorgeous and the cubic zirconia is spectacular.  The stones are small which adds to the simplicity of the band.  Each stone is in its own separate prong lending to the detail put into the creation of this ring.  I purchased a size up because my fingers tend to swell and it fits perfectly.

"These earrings are simply gorgeous.  They shine and shimmer with pure elegance and grace.  They fit on my earlobe perfectly without any drooping or overhang.  The studs don't cause me any irritation, redness, itching, discomfort in any way.  They honestly look like and wear like extremely  expensive black onyx and diamond earrings.  I wore them recently to a play at our local theater and received many compliments on them and was asked quite a few times ""where did you get those exquisite earrings""?!

They feel cool and almost non existent on the body, which is a huge plus for this type of weather!  The fit is perfect and the workmanship is beautiful.  Super, super silky and very attractive.

"There isn't really anything I can say about this set as a reviewer that anyone who knows Fisher-Price and Thomas doesn't already know but I will give it a shot.  I will say that Fisher-Price always makes quality toys and this set is more proof of that fact.  The Thomas is big enough for very little hands to hold, the track is sturdy enough for little hands to use and small enough of an out of the way corner so mom and dad don't trip over it every time they walk by.

"How cute is this??  Soft cloth Anteater hats that you velcro on any size head and then you run to find the ants that you then capture on the snout.  So fun.  Basically this is an interactive memory game.  You collect matching picnic foods using the memory cards and then you race to find an ant, pick up the ant and run back to your picnic before the time runs out of the timer.  It is a great game that helps kids remember using the ever popular memory game, yet allows for running around and playing by the rules of the timer.  I like the concept very much.  The ants are made from cloth in primary colors and the anteater hats are adorable soft cloth with pink ears.  So funny!  Melissa and Doug have come up with another winner.  The age is 4 and up, but I think this would be fine for younger as well.

"Outstanding.  I love the flavor and its soothing benefits on my throat.  I've always had severe throat issues during the winter months.  It seems the dry heat destroys my vocal cords.  I've tried everything possible to add water back into the air, but still my vocal cords always get trashed and I loose my voice for about 2 months.  Last year the Dr. told me if I didn't figure out a way to reduced the stress on my cords, I would possibly need surgery to remove polyps.  This Honey Elixir did the trick!  Using it daily, every day for this past year has proved to be most beneficial!  I can't tell you how many ""cures"" including keeping my heat down to next to nothing I've tried over the years with little to no results.  Comvita Manuka Honey Propolis Elixir is my relief.

"This is fun.  This tiny piece of amazing plugs into your phone to show you what your eyes can't possibly see!  I do Energy Work as well as Space Clearing energies from homes, offices, land, barns and whatever have you.  I do this using my intuition and my ""feeling and seeing"" hands.  I've become pretty efficient at sensing the energies around me, but using this camera makes it so much more real for people to see.  I've taken before and after shots of places and people and before and after energy and clearing and believe me, there is a huge difference!  I tried for years to explain to my best friend how energy can stay somewhere without seeing it and she never believed me.  Now, I was able to take a picture of my feet and then the picture of the energy after I moved my feet.  That finally did it!  She saw first hand how energy (heat) stays in an area once the physical form leaves.  SO COOL!  I know that this camera is for many more tangible uses as in plumbing, heating, electrical, but for me it is energy all the way!  LOVE this camera!

"Overall, I really like Holi. It is undoubtedly a really cool product and an excellent party trick. You can use the mood lighting to provide ambiance to a room or use sync the light to your music, which actually looks and sounds almost seamless. However,  at least with my experience with my Android device, the music app is pretty bad. When a song ends, it does not simply play the next song. Rather, you have to manually select a new track.

Over this past weekend my son, a 21 year old senior in college, helped build this set with a few much younger kids and from what I could see all of them were challenged enough to make them focus, but also had a great time building it.  All remarked on how nicely made all of the pieces were. The all  were impressed with the the small characters that came with the aircraft and loved the finished product.  It seems that my son was able to do most of this without the use of the directions, but the younger ones did use that directions and they were very easy to follow and accurate.

"These models never get old for my son who has been building as early as Duplo  and Weebles!  He is now a Senior in college and still loves building Action figure models and buildings. Santa always finds a way to hide them under the tree for him!  I had originally thought that the Halo SpruKits were more similar to Lego.  More specifically to Lego's Bionicle series, but while the concept seems similar they aren't nearly the same. While SpruKits are pose able and are of high quality plastic and design, this particular model is much easier to build and less likely to loose pieces or break.  They have larger and less pieces and not quite as intricate. SpruKits Halo the Master Chief is also PERFECT in the look of the character.  Of the two, I believe that SpruKits would be much better for the novice builder/modeler or the modeler who is more into the gaming theme.  I think, however, that any fan of Halo, regardless of age or level will be quite impressed with this figure.

"Bottom Line Up Top@  A nice introduction to stretch resistance band exercise, but my enthusiasm is dampened by non-adjustable band length, suggested exercises that have risk of minor injury, and slightly high price for what you get.  However, it's eminently portable, doesn't cost that much (even though I'd like to see them take a few dollars off), and definitely gives a workout.Before we get to the customary Amazon.com review PROs and CONs, let's dispense of one complaint right away:  The downloadable instruction video doesn't download. Gaiam, in a response to this complaint in another review, posted the URL: www.gaiam.com/barrebeginners.  And....repeat,  www.gaiam.com/barrebeginners.  GOOD!  (It is NOT www.gaiam.com/beginnersbarrekit.)  Thank you, Gaiam!PROs1. This is a relatively inexpensive introduction to resistance band exercise.  If you find an exercise you enjoy, with none of the negatives mentioned below, you will get a very good workout!2. It's portable, lightweight, easy to pack.  Get some strength and cardiovascular work done traveling.  For that matter, it doesn't take up much room in your home either.3. There are many resistance band  exercises that can be found on the web. You don't need to rely on the few (and generally not very good, in my opinion. exercises pictured on an insert that comes with the package.4.  Materials are strong, grips comfortable.5. The ball can be used either alone or in conjunction with the band.  Much like the blocks used in Hatha Yoga, it provides support, keeps your body in the proper position, and helps work targeted muscles.  Don't count on it to do a whole lot more than that, it's a small (5 inch diameter) rubber ball that Gaiam characterizes as mini.""  However it's useful, and it may confer some transfer of training benefits if you ever decide to do Hatha Yoga.In-Between a Pro and a Con.You have to inflate the ball.  They provide the needle (HINT: Open your package very carefully so that you don't lose the needle); you provide the bicycle or ball pump (and eventually you'll need to pump it up again).  Yes, this is an inconvenience, but a blow-up ball (as in, you inflate it like a beach ball-with your mouth) would probably not be as durable, and could release air while you're using it.CONs:1. I think Gaiam should take a few dollars off the price.  The materials just aren't very expensive.  On the other hand, look at similar equipment:  A lot of it seems overpriced.2.  SNAP!  OK, I did an exercise pictured on the insert:  Put the handles in from of you, and the middle of the band behind the sole of one foot. Raise your foot and leg up for a great stretch against resistance.  Sounds fine until:  OUCH!  The band rolled off my foot and, like a rubber band, snapped against my butt. No injury, but it hurt a little, and made me think, 1) In what other exercises might this happen, and 2) Be careful using this around others.3. Non-Adjustable Band!  There's another exercise shown on the insert:  Wrap the middle of the band around your shins so that it is anchored there, then pull each handle with your hands (looks sort of like a rowing machine motion).  Two problems here:  You can't adjust the band length, so you have to fumble around trying to wrap it around and across your legs the right amount of times.  If you have to wrap it a few times, there's some pinching going on.  It still didn't give me a very good stretch; the band is just too long (for me) to use for this exercise.Let's be fair, an adjustable band, a SAFE adjustable band, that is, would cost much more.  Also, there are exercises in which I was able to adjust the band length (for example, doubling it around my back for one of the exercises worked well and didn't pinch my back).  However, you may find that you can't comfortably or efficiently perform some (or more) of the available exercises.CAUTIONS:  Gaiam states very responsibly that you should talk to your health care professional before starting this or any other program, and that any such program comes with inherent risks.  I would add that you should probably be very cautious about improvising; that is, making up your own exercises.  That seems risky to me as well.You get what you pay for (usually).  This is an inexpensive introduction to resistance bands,  I think there will be limits to the exercises that will work, and this will vary individually. If you find a few that you like and that work for you, great!  If this gets you up and around more, and encourages you do try other things, even better!  Again, please consult your health care professional about the use of this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SKT1J0BEJBTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010I7C1CY#wasThisHelpful","R1SKT1J0BEJBTZ","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Bottom Line Up Top""@A sturdy, well-designed, multi-functional iron that I recommend highly.This iron works well, we expect that, but it's the extra, very thoughtful and useful features that make this product a standout over most irons.  Its performance, price, design, warranty, soleprint, and dimensions are similar to our current iron Black & Decker D3040 Allure Digital Iron, Blue. They're both excellent; I have a very slight preference for the B&D compared to the Rowenta. Although I won't cover *every* aspect of each iron, I include some comparisons here. I hope these will be helpful.  I'm also taking into account that the Rowenta, which seems like it *may* be losing a little heat, is at least 5 years old, and the Black and Decker is new.Similarities:  The irons are similarly sized, hefty without being bulky (don't buy if you want an iron that is lighter in weight than most),have 3-way auto shut-off, stainless steel ironing ""plate,"" a sprayer and variable steam settings, a 360 degree pivoting power cord, self-cleaning capabilities, and customer service numbers (which I have not needed to use with the 5-year old Rowenta.Key differences: Advantage, Black and Decker1. The water tank is much easier to fill.  You can tip it upwards, and the container top functions somewhat like a funnel.  The Rowenta isn't that bad, but not as quick and easy to fill.2. A two-year warranty compared to one-year for the Rowenta; however, B&D states that you're responsible for shipping of parts.  Ridiculous.  I'd be really surprised if they insisted on this, especially if you have a defective or broken piece, but the product insert does state this.  I do not have warranty information from the Rowenta other than the one-year duration.3. The power cords are about the same length, but the Black and Decker cord is slightly more flexible, making it easier to use.4. The Black and Decker has a small front-light, convenient for seeing if you really got that wrinkle or crease out.Key differences: Advantage, Black and Decker1. The water tank is much easier to fill.

The Black and Decker has a small front-light, convenient for seeing if you really got that wrinkle or crease out.Key Differences, Advantage Rowenta.1. The Amazon.com product page for the Rowenta has much more information than that for the B&D, even when one includes the instructions (and useful tips and safety instructions) that come with the Black and Decker.  Both irons have switches that let you adjust the amount of steam, but Rowenta lists quantitative information (!) about the amount of steam released at different steam setting.  I know also that the Rowenta goes up to 1,700 Watts; I couldn't find this specification on the B&D or its supporting material.2. The Rowenta has an anti-calcium mechanism in addition to the self-cleaning capability.  Unfortunately, I can't evaluate how much of an advantage this really is.  Same things goes for the 400 holes on the bottom of the Rowenta iron.  Perhaps this increases the efficiency of the steam bursts, or perhaps it makes little or no difference compared with the 20+ holes on the bottom of the B&D.  However, I appreciate the attention to detail and respect for the consumer shown by Rowenta.Tie/Personal Prefererence.Most of the above are, admittedly, minor differences.  Another difference, rotary vs. digital temperature may also seem trivial, or may be important to you.  The B&D temperature is set by pressing a button that takes you through five discrete settings denoted by fabric type, ranging fro the coolest setting, Silk/polyester, up through blends, wool, cotton, and to the hottest, linen. The instruction manual explains this well. The Rowenta has the more familiar dial.  This, of course, is continuous, but I really don't know if the temperature changes with each small dial turn.  The dial has dots at various intervals, between and under these dots are the labels ""Min. (minimum)"", ""synthetics,"" ""wool-silk,"" and""wool-cotton."" This gives a feeling of more control, but I suspect most people will just turn the dial to the appropriate fabric setting.  Personally, It's a toss-up: The Black and Decker feels more ""modern"" and is easier to use; the Rowenta dial is familiar, appears to give more precise heat (even if it doesn't) but is somewhat harder to get to (it's located under the handle).I think both irons are superb.  I have just the slightest preference (assuming the prices of the two are still about the same) based on the ease of using the water tank, the somewhat more flexible cord, the two-year warranty (but call B and D and ask about those shipping fees!), and a slightly more appealing appearance.  I can easily see someone preferring the Rowenta, and do not feel that buying it would be a mistake.  Both excellent, both recommended, not just by me, but by most Amazon.com reviewers.  You might want to look at (trustworthy) negative reviews to help make your decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32RFCW9WZE5PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5ILE2W#wasThisHelpful","R32RFCW9WZE5PV","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This relatively new model from Panasonic give a better shave than most others in its price class, but I doubt I'll be able to persuade rotary blade enthusiasts to the double rectangular foil used here.  This is one of the main design differences in electric razors.  I've tried both.  My personal feeling is that this type cuts closer but may be just a bit rougher on the skin.  For me, that was no problem: In fact; some rotaries seem like they glide so smoothly on the skin that they're not able to produce as close a shave.  Furthermore, the dual foils aren't rigid; they move up and down like tires following the contours of a road.The PROs:  The close shave mentioned above, and the following:It's relatively quiet compared to many others.It charges fast and holds a charge for a longer time than most (although you don't know when it's finished, you'll learn how after the first few).It really is a wet/dry shaver.  Go ahead, dunk it, run water over it...just don't drop it in the bathtub (Admittedly, I did not test this for you).It has a solid feel and a certain satisfying ""heft"" to it, unlike, say, the sleek and shiny Philips Norelco 6100 Shaver that I ultimately got tired of looking at.  This has a solid feeling and a classic black and silver color scheme.The head (that part of the device that contains the ""foils"" moves right and left, as well as up and down, but it still has enough rigidity that you can (comfortably) shave curvy parts of your face and neck closely. Most people will agree that a safety or disposable non-mobile blade can cut closer, but without shaving cream or hot water and soap, you're more likely to nick yourself.  And, aesthetically, unless you have a Merkur or other steel razor, the disposables do not inspire.CONs:This razor may be cleaned with either 1) pouring some included detergent (with perfume and sodium nitrate in it-ugh) and water over the blades, *trying* to get it to lather (it didn't) and rinsing, or 2) placing the razors down in a covered receptacle with that detergent, letting it soak, and rinsing.A few things I don't like about this:  Method 1 doesn't give you the lather pictured on  the enclosure (big deal), but it also seems like plenty of nothing:  The detergent pours out too quickly from a sealed metallic container, the perfume is too strong, you must rinse if you get detergent on your face, and I doubt it does much better than just taking the head off and rinsing it with plain soap and water. Method 2 has some of the disadvantages of method 1, plus you have to hang the razor from a very cheap looking and feeling holder.  The efforts of the Panasonic advertising department, the writers and package designers who want you to feel like you're enjoying a semi-luxury experience with a fine ""instrument,"" might as well throw in the towel when that holder is standing on your sink.  Cheap and juvenile-looking, you really don't need it, nor the detergent.I see that most electric razors of this caliber sell for around $125.  That's not Amazon.com's fault; it appears that the price for electric razors has inexplicably gone up the past 5 or so years.  I advise you to wait until it's closer to $100, or to try one that regularly sells for that much that might be cheaper without the ""cleaning system.""  Bottom line, though, this works well and fast and the razor, at least, is designed very well.Disclosure:  This product was sent to me free in exchange for my honest review, and my donating (well, it's taxes, so it's not really a gift) about 1/3 of the price to the federal  government.

"You would need an MD or other medical or scientific degree/expertise to sift through the many claims about medicinal mushrooms.  I thought I would try to summarize these, but the task is too daunting, and I would not want to mislead anyone: As they say, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. If you're interested in mushroom medicine research, try Wikipedia as an introduction, or go to PubMed.gov and look up ""medicinal mushrooms.""  However, the literature is not easy to digest, so perhaps the best thing to do is to talk to your professional health provider about potential medical benefits and/or risks of this product.I'm going to focus, therefore, on the aesthetic qualities of the Medicinal Mushroom powder.  The label (and Amazon.com) lists the mushrooms:  Cordyceps, Reishi, Agaricus Blazei, Shiitake, Maitake, and Turkey Tails, with a ""prebiotic fiber.""  The powder has an acceptable color, either a mild or no discernible odor, and is ground to a fine consistency, making it very easy to scoop up and pour.  I have not tried this in water, but other reviewers have noted that it is on the sweet (sometimes too sweet) side, due to the addition of stevia.The product mixes very well in a blender; I add it to all kinds of smoothies. It does not appear to affect how they taste.  That, to me, is a big plus. When you open the container, you may be quite surprised to see that it's only about 25-40% full; however, you do get the promised 30-day supply.I've used this for the past several weeks, and simply hope it does some good. If I decide to continue, I would probably consult my doctor(s).  If you're already a medicinal mushroom user, and believe that it is beneficial for you, then you will appreciate the sensory and physical (i.e., it pours easily) properties of this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBWPP3TR7EDPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW8ZHZ6#wasThisHelpful","RBWPP3TR7EDPF","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has a simple, but well constructed, twist design that has a very nice ""rose"" gold tone.  It's gold-plated stainless steel, and the color is not glitzy cheap, but has a ""tempered"" bright appearance, with a *very* rose undertone.  That tone acts to give a less yellow gold hue, and I think it's very appealing.This would easily get a 5* rating, but the manufacturers didn't get the size right.  Advertised as a 7, it's bigger than any other size 7 that my spouse owns, and too easily slips off her ring finger. I can't recommend this unless you're willing to keep it from sliding off through some sort of arrangement, for example:1. Put a correctly-sized ring in front of it as a stacked ring.2. Tie a tiny piece of thread around one spot, effectively reducing its size,3, Wearing it on your middle finger.4. Attaching it as a decoration to a necklace.5. Your own creative solution.Of course, people's finger widths differ, and it's *possible* this will fit you. However, I think it will simply prove too big for most.

"Yes, I lifted and twisted the title off a classic TV ad for Irish Spring soap, but it serves a purpose:  Apparently marketed to women, either gender will appreciate the superior design and cutting of this package of eight disposable razors.  Any men with a reluctance about pastels should just get over it, and here's why...A sharp, three-bladed cutting edge headlines this BIC razor, and, whatever they do, it's both sharper and holds that quality far longer than the cellophane-bagged BIC jumbles sold at most drugstores.  It's more expensive per razor, but the quality more than justifies any difference.  This thing is sharp, but comfortable; there's the usual lubricated strip above the blades that offers some softening qualities (without melting in the heat like some products), but if your skin is sensitive or you're taking anti-coagulants for your DVT, lather your face (or your legs, or whatever) with some cream or soap and water, and be cautious the first time.  You'll do fine.  Of course, for true safety concerns, you may wish to consult your Depillatory Health Specialist.OK, it's sharp, what else, Mr. Expert?  The design....  this razor fits your hand like a glove, if you used a glove to shave yourself.  IT has a nice *solid* feeling, like it's not gonna melt down the drain with the suds, or shatter if you drop it.  The curves, as the noir writers used to say, are all in the right places.  Furthermore, there's two grippy areas on the handle, one about halfway up for your thumb to rest on, one further down, near the end of the handle.  The first is for most shaving, and enables a degree of precision you won't find with cheaper models.  The second allows you to grip the razor by the end, so that you can reach further--convenient for shaving long legs, or other difficult-to-reach areas.The 3 razors are built-in, they don't  need insertion and removal. These last long enough that you may want to clean the blades after several uses, but that would be a little tricky since they're not removable.  Not impossible, just tricky.These feel anything but cheap, and work better than just about any other disposable out there, certainly better than any I'm aware of.

"With the continuing proliferation of electronic gadgets, and, really, the need to recharge them, consumers need multi-socket adapters such as this sturdy, well-design product.  It gives you 750 Joules of  protection (and we all remember from high school physics that a Joule is  the amount of energy transferred to an object when a force of one newton acts on that object through a distance of one meter, whatever a ""newton "" is. I'll explain that later.), so that a spike in voltage is either grounded or diverted.Although your parameters may differ, I found a source stating that power line surges inside a building can be up to 6,000 volts, 3,000 amperes, and deliver up to 90 joules of energy.  Please consult your electronics or engineering professional if you're unsure of what you need.Techno-speak aside, this device allow you to plug in several devices; as I said, I most often need that when recharging several gadgets at a time (e.g., electric toothbrush, shaver, mp3 player, etc.).  They've designed this so that it can plug into the top (or bottom) of something with two sockets, leaving the other one free for another device.  For example, I have a reading lamp plugged into the bottom socket; the top is reserved for this.  It's not permanently attached to the wall, use it whenever you need it.You can cover the openings that the plug goes into by sliding protectors across the openings.  A red light shines when it is plugged in, a nice reminder.  I had just a tiny bit of difficulty getting a plug to go into the sockets, but, personally, I'd rather have something that fits solidly then a plug than too loosely.  Not enough of a problem for me to lower the rating.  This feels solid, is an unobtrusive grey, and is relatively inexpensive.Now, what is a Newton.... Remember that ,Force = Mass * Acceleration.  In this case, that translates to1 Newton = 1 kilogram * meters/second squared.I just thought you might like to know; there will not be a test.750 Joules of protection, 3-outlet, wall tap/adapter plugs directly into the outlet- Works with computers, printers, household electronics, small home appliances, and internet modems- Built-in EMI / RFI noise filtration - Prevents circuit interference/degradation- Sliding safety covers protects users from accidental contact and keeps dust from unused outlets- $100,000 connected equipment warranty","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BHPHRRL2UVI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMJ8W#wasThisHelpful","R2BHPHRRL2UVI3","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update:  This computer now WON'T connect to the internet!  It did for the first week or so, but then, nothing.  I have gone through troubleshooting (by the way, this internet connectivity, I found, is a fairly common complaint), and so far nothing has worked.  Toshiba customer support is VERY mixed.  I'm having a very difficult time reaching an agent, but there is a fairly good 'community support board.'Update 2:  Today the internet connection is working (with the exception of IE-I'm having no problems with Firefox).  I have no idea why it's working, but perhaps somehow it did download a fix. Although this remains very puzzling, I do have a few tips for prospective buyers.1.  Go to the customer support forums of several computers and compare the number and kind of complaints you read, and whether either a company rep. or a user answers the question.  I think most companies have something like this.  Although I'd bet every single computer has a fair number of complaints, look for patterns (for example, internet connectivity came up a lot for this model), see if the answers seem responsive, and investigate the complaints with company reps. or at a store.2. If at all possible, buy an extended warranty (unless you're an expert at repair).  In my area, the least expensive quote I got was $80 an hour, and I assume that was without parts-just labor.  (I'm using Square Trade right now to repair a 1 3/4 year old HP. ) Fortunately the Toshiba did not need repairs, but I'd still recommend buying an extended plan.  As k a lot of questions before you buy one, though.The Toshiba Satellite Fusion (""It's a Laptop!"" ""It's a detachable [but very big] tablet!"") is a well-powered, well-designed laptop that is relatively light (all comparisons are to an HP Envy Touchsmart m6 Sleekbook and some Dell laptops from 5-10 years ago that I'd rather just forget about (SO easy to overhear). The most important specs: It's a 15.6-Inch convertible 2 in 1 touchscreen laptop, with a speedy 2.2GHz Intel Core i5-5200U processor and Mobile Intel HD graphics. It has 8GB RAM and 128GB solid-state drive, Windows 10 (for better or worse) is pre-loaded with this laptop. The Windows 10 is pre-loaded with this laptop (for better or worse).I'm very pleased with the I-5 CPU and the solid state build, definitely superior to the I-3. Download times are fast, game-playing is very good for the price, and I love the display (rich colors, very good resolution) and the large, easy-to-use keyboard: The keys light up on the dark, and are neither too close nor too far from each other. I have just a few hardware complaints: As with many laptops these days (at around this price), there's no disk drive for DVDs, CD, etc., you'll need to buy one . The touch pad is not-bifurcated for easy selection of right- and-left-clicking; in other words, it's one rectangular block with no separation of right vs. left. My experience with the HP is that this can get more and more difficult to use with wear: You may want to get a mouse, eventually. However, it's possible that the Toshiba will work better in the long run. Also, the touch screen works OK, but I wish it were a little more sensitive. Sound actually has some stereo imaging, but there's no equalizer (there usually isn't) to dampen the treble.The real test of the computer probably can't happen for another year, when it's full of cookies and assorted other garbage. I think Windows 10 is slightly better than Windows 8, with the exception of the search function it's a little easier to navigate through the essential setting controls (analogous to the great ""Control Panel"" that Windows 7 had, and the Microsoft got rid of with Windows 8).The initial set-up is especially annoying, with pop-ups (for example, when you want to download Java, which I still haven't done successfully) advertising free Windows scanning and repairing..only it's NOT free, the pop-up is difficult to close, and when I ran the scan (that's free, the repair is not), it found over 200 errors in a computer I had barely used. These are the annoyances that PC users have become used to seeing, and one reason many switch to Apple.Bottom line: You get a lot more for $700 or so then you used to! If the 15.6"" screen size and resulting extra weight are ok with you (for example, I rarely take my laptop out traveling, so lightweight portability is not much of an issue) you get a really excellent monitor, a great solid-state build, and an I-5 CPU. Take a look at other laptops selling for under $800, and I think this is probably as good as any of them. It's not going to outperform a $1,200 computer, but you shouldn't expect that, of course. Also, consider getting an extended warranty from Square Trade or some other company (read the fine print always); it may be worth it in the long run.

"I didn't have a child to try this on, and the dog wasn't being very cooperative, so...I liked it!  It has a mostly pleasant, light scent, sort of lime with undertones of bubblegum. I know that may sound unappealing, but I don't think the fragrance is overdone; however, I can imagine others not liking it.  In addition, that scent did linger for a little while... Actually, I'm not sure how much I would like this in the long run.You don't need to use much, it's clear, has a light viscosity, and lathers without turning your hair into something like a washing machine with too much Tide in it. I don't think it's *completely* sting-free should you get some in your eyes, but I don't know if it's appreciably worse than products designed for kids.  I would ask friends with little kids what they use and then compare.  However, aside from the somewhat chemical-ridden list of ingredients (which also makes me suspect-though I don't know this-that a ""simpler"" ingredient list might be easier on the eyes of babe) trying this product out is a relatively expensive proposition.  This seems much too way over-priced to me. Lower it by 20-35%, and I might consider getting it again. However, even though I thought this was a pretty good product, the cost and the fact that I'm not totally pleased with it makes that unlikely.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWBU2G9HKYFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQJY5F0#wasThisHelpful","R1MWBU2G9HKYFK","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"That's some copy writer they hired over at European Soaps, LLC:""May in Provence, that special time of year when Rose de Mai blooms for five weeks only.... Each bloom is hand-picked early morning, ...placed into the harvest basket...captures the essence of its hundred, fragrant petals...""OK, let's assume that all of the above is true.  It's OK if it's not; the soap can stand on its own merits: A rich smell (Notez bien: do not purchase if you're sensitive to scents or don't adore roses), beautifully presented inside and out, and, a hundred petals or not, it really is from France. It's quad-milled too, which means that the ingredients are mixed around four separate times, resulting in less water and a longer-lasting product.So, you may wonder why this doesn't receive the coveted 5-star rating, the consumer products equivalent of the Palme D'or.It's the ingredients.  As you know, soap is a product of saponification, the mixture of a fat or oil with an alkali salt.  We can expect, therefore, that some sort of salt will be present (lye, for example, is an alkali salt).  However, there are many, many other chemicals to select from the (complete) ingredient list, not all of which sound so Gallic-ly romantic.These include:*Cl 73360 (D &C red 30 lake), Cl 17200 (D&C red 33 al lake).(Whoa, the color is apparently not completely from les roses de Mai...)There's also Sodium chloride, tetra-sodium etidronate, sodium hydroxide, tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium palmate, sodium palm kernelate (must be the salts).Also, benzyl alcohol, amyl cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, methyl 2-octynoate hydroxyisohexyl, 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, alpha isomethyl ionone, hexyl cinnamal, butyphenyl methylpropional, benzyl benzoate.The good-sounding stuff:rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, helianthuus annuus (sunflower) seed oil,  botanical rose blend (rosa damascena flower wax & rosa centifolia flower wax), butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter extract, rosa damascena (rose) flower extract, aqua (water), parfum (fragrance).  And also...over 15 other ingredients including palm acid, glycerin, EDTA, citronellol, geraniol, benzyl salicylate, linalool, hydroxycityronellal, eugenol, citral, limonene, anise alcohol, cinnamal, benzyl cinnamate, coumarin, amy cinnamal, farnesol,and  isoeugenol.Now I'm not gonna go all flouride on you.  All of these may be completely natural, found in les jardins de Provence or on the stairwell of Le Tour Eiffel.  I'm not a chemist (apparently a requirement for really knowing your soaps), and it may be that a lot of these ingredients are pretty standard.However, it's a question of aesthetics.  They want to emphasize the hundred, fragrant petals; but I also see an ingredient list that reads like an order for Chem. 101.  Tom's of Maine, at least, tells you where the ingredients come from.  Now, all of this may be completely irrelevant.  It's a very good product; I just wish I knew a little more about what goes into the mill (x 4).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5AJK8HCOKXV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVNYIFW#wasThisHelpful","R5AJK8HCOKXV5","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In fact, the taste recalls tequila; that is, if one *can* recall tasting tequila.  That was a big downer for me.

(A reprint of the label can be found at their website, http://myvega.com/product/vega-one-nutritional-shake.At the current sale price, each serving costs about $3.00, higher than we might like, but competitively priced with products that pack this much nutritional value and with this ingredient ""pedigree.""

"Neutrogena has long been a favorite company, having used their skin and hair products for many years. I found that this product did as well as others, and the company notes that Cool Dry Sport is sweat and water resistant (not sweat and water proof).  Since resistant is a fairly vague word, I would follow their directions about re-application, or better, yet, ask a doctor or related professional.An important subjective consideration is whether you prefer sprays or lotions.  Sprays, in general, go on and feel ""lighter,"" may dry faster and work quicker; however, I find that lotions give me more sensory feedback about whether I've covered everything, and that's why I sometimes prefer lotions. However, I've used both ""delivery"" systems and feel fine with a spray (some adults or kids may not prefer it).  As noted by others, this is very lightly scented, and not labelled as hypo-allergenic, but I had no unpleasant sensations or reactions.  The Neutrogena website offers more information about the non-active ingredients, as well as some nice tips about augmenting sprays/lotions protection with hats and other clothing, and limiting exposure.

"For those who have loved their old Interplak, all I can say is make sure this is the identical model to what you used before.  I don't know what Conair was thinking, but this is the worst toothbrush I've ever used, with the possible exception of some completely flimsy manual one the dentist hand out when we were kids.  There's just too little power.Now, it's true that the brushing action is more important than the POWER, per se.  We're not talking horsepower here.  However, when an electric toothbrush is so weak that it stops when it accidentally rubs against your  inner mouth, when it's so weak that it barely moves when used with toothpaste, when it's so weak that you don't feel you're really getting your teeth clean...well, there's not much point in buying it.The best part about this toothbrush is the eight-bristle brush-one of the best I've used. It does, indeed, reach down between your teeth.  Although probably not a substitute for flossing (as with all consumer health products, ask your health provider for her or his recommendations), they're very well designed.  Too bad they're saddled with such a bad motor.  Even worse, I can find a place to buy substitute brush heads The ones pictured here on Amazon.com aren't the same as the 8-bristle brush that comes with this.  A month or more ago, I did see replacements, but they cost more than twice the price of the entire toothbrush, and I didn't see them for sale at the Conair website.If for some reason you want an extremely gentle toothbrush that may not brush your entire mouth without stopping a few times, and you don't want to replace the only thing good about the product (the brush heads), you might want to purchase this. However, there are much better toothbrushes out there, many of which have ""low"" vibration mode for gentle brushing, and I'd recommend those instead.  As said above, your dental health provider may be able to recommend something better.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZV9ZIEP7KGYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DO442DU#wasThisHelpful","R2ZV9ZIEP7KGYA","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first time I've worn this shape in a helmet; I've had those sleek, racing-style ones with a little color and design (though I don't even come close to racing).  When I first saw it, I thought, 'this is gonna weigh a ton,' and I really had my doubts about comfort and style.I'm happy to report that everything about the Commuter BIke and Skate Helmet was a pleasant surprise.  If I had weighed it and my usual helmet, perhaps I would have discovered that it's heavier.  However, it just feels solid and secure and just safer, without added weight; at least, not enough to bother me. It's superbly balanced, perhaps that why it felt so good.  As I said, it feels safer, and makes me feel much more secure.  Whether it actually *is* safer than those lower profile, pointier helmets...well, consult your local bicycle (or skate) services professional.Other things I like about the helmet:  The strap is, of course, adjustable, and there's a good loose-to-tight range. It take a tiny bit of effort to adjust the strap (something I'm sure I""ll get better at), but it stays in place and is well-designed. I like the simple design, the ventilation, and the comfortable velcro-held interior padding, as I've seen on other helmets.  The color is a light matte grey, very nice, not boring white, and not cliche black. That, of course, is very subjective, but the somewhat retro style has its own flavor of rebellion against the trendy, trying-too-hard style of some.  It comes with some nice safety tips for those not up on the limitations of the helmets (i.e., they can't protect against everything).  Great design, and a must for those who want some head protection while they bicycle or skate-and that should include everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YG3AIR3XHREK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMIN7EK#wasThisHelpful","R2YG3AIR3XHREK","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A relatively fun way to learn the database manager/statistical software ""R."" the authors take the novel approach of teaching the language within the context of baseball statistics.  Become a sabermetrician and become the envy of your neighborhood!Those who favor the ""learning R"" aspect will be reawarded more than baseball aficionados.  The latter will be satisfied with some of the fairly arcane learning examples (how well did Warren Spahn pitch in the post-war era; what are the relatively trajectories by age of the home run totals of Bonds, Ruth, and Aaron; predicting post-season performace with Markov chain probabilities-we'll have to try that with the 2014 Giants sometime), but the focus is on learning R, not learning baseball lore. For example, the baseball problems don't containa lot of context:  Bonds' probably steroid use is not mentioned; it's irrelevant to the main topic.""R"" is not an intuitive language. though moreso than SQL.  In my experience it is increasingly used as either a first-line or adjunctive statistical programming language alongside the most popular (social science) packages: SAS, SPSS, Mplus, and, for database construction, SQL (which is also part of SAS using Proc SQL).  It uses elements of SAS /SPSS with a few of the more manageable conocepts from SQL (NO, I'm not a fan of SQL, but then, I came rather late to it.).While certainly not a ""Book for Dummies"" (and really, must beginners put up with that...), some experience with databases will bevery helpful.  You'll also get more out of the book with some statistical knowledge, but that's not necesary.  It seems like most languages have their own nomenclature for the same methods and concepts, and the authors excel at presenting R's vernacular in a slow, patient style that will help you grasp the fundamentals, and they use screen shots and drawings to help guide you through the R graphic interface. Here's an example of their pedagogy from page 32:Type directly into the console window (they xshow where this is, Spahn's games won for his 7 seasons with the Boston Braves.  L < -(5,10,12,14,17,14,10) to create what R calls a ""vector.""  (No, not all examples concern the great Spahn!).The R ""vector"" is simply the SAS/SPSS ""variable"" and the SQL ""column!""  Five pages later, we're introduced to the concept of matrices so that we can save our data rather than repeatedly entering it (like a SAS datastep or an SQL table or view), and on page 41, they introduce the concept of ""scripts"" (a tool which seems similar to a SAS macro.)Not only is this well organized, logical, and generally clear, but the book explains where to download a free ""R"" program and how to import some web-basedbaseball-oriented datasets (with actual data; this *will* fascinate baseball people!) on which to practice. There are practice exercises (although I didn;t see any ranswers), a dual index (one for commands and one for topics), and over 53 refences for further exploraion of R and related material.  Statistical heavyweights can practice logistic and linear regression (R uses a General Linear Model), exploring moving averages and moving average plots (the book has a large amount of material on R graphics), quadratic model fit, how to calculate a wqeighted on-base percentage, and slugging percentage.Although some of this may sound rather daunting, it's still an excellent book for the relative beginner, and you don't need to understand every concept to benefit.  If you're completely new to statistical and database concepts, you should probably go with something simpler, but others will learn a lot from this refreshingly interesting and well-written book.  When you get bogged down in it, go out and play some ball; it'll help clear your head.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWZS01KGN9E80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1466570229#wasThisHelpful","RWZS01KGN9E80","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun retelling of ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" with a post-modern bent.  I say ""post-modern"" because it not only comments on itself (our protagonist points to a large textbox on the first page and asks what it is...) but it also neatly deconstructs the old story to its essentials (in this excerpt, a young dog tries to summarize the plot he just heard from Cat, a parental/guardian figure):""So let's see if I have this right. The Red Hood is on her way to help an old lady when she meets the Wolfman. He has an evil plan.  He likes to dress up in girls' clothes and eat people.  He and Red have a big battle, and Red's father puts an end to Wolfie.""That's not exactly how Cat told the story to the 4-or 5ish year-old Dog, but Dog interrupts with so many questions and neatly ignores so many answers that it's no surprise he can't repeat the plot verbatim.  And that's the fun of the story, the questioning dog and the increasingly exasperated Cat turn story-time into a verbal wrestle, and if the ending has is mildly violent (Cat, fed up with one more question, throws the book at Dog. ""Ouch"" he exclaims as it lands on his head); well, the book should not be read by the literal minded.The story stays fairly close to the traditional telling (although the handsome woodsman is changed to Hood's father, thus neatly dodging any sexual angle), but Dog has an extraordinary logic that strips away some of the fantastic claims of the original. When the wolf first encounters the girl in the forest, Dog asks, ""Hang on...why doesn't the wolfman try to ear Hood Girl then and there?""  later, the dog observes with a scowl, "" She's not very bright, is she?  I mean, if there were a wolf dressed up as MY grandma, I might have noticed right away.""  (Somehow, dog knows to use the subjunctive ""were"" instead of ""was""!).  There's also some clever interior humor, as he notes that the book's endpaper does come at the end of the book, contrary to cat's explanation that it comes at the beginning (they're at both places.)The book shines with a modern sensibility as dog expects superpowers and exploding eggs, a wry comment on a lot of children's entertainment these days.  The jokes trade on these clashes: Traditional vs. contemporary, questioning child/dog and initially patient adult/cat, naive, age-appropriate dog vs. a wise beyond years ""Peanuts"" mentality. (Soon after hearing the rather gruesome detail that the father ""arrived and CHOPPED OFF THE WOLF's HEAD WITH AN AXE!"", the dog asks whether Cat is absolutely sure this is a children's book.  Actually, I found this a little too explicit myself, but that's for the potential buyer to decide.  The book is just a little flat towards the end, but dog not only gives that great summary of the plot, but has one more sensible question about whether grandma is still hiding in the closet.

"Yes, this really is damask, and yes, it is polyester,  If the polyester seems a bit declasse for your social circles, consider this from the unassailable authority on these matters, Wikipedia:""Damask weaves are commonly produced in monochromatic (single-colour) weaves in silk, linen or synthetic fibres such as rayon and feature patterns of flowers, fruit, and other designs.""The key words here are ""synthetic"" (polyester!), ""monochromatic"" (the wine-red), and ""other designs"" (sort of a scroll pattern that might remind you of a light, open paisley).  Therefore, this is authentic damask, even if it's not meant for the heirloom collection.Function follows price, and the DII (a company with over 1,200 products on Amazon.com) tablecloth performs admirably.  It's festive rather than gaudy, and could be used for almost any celebratory occasion, kids or adults.  It sheds stains and wrinkles, and, at worst, you can even wash and dry this 60 by 104 inch fabric in a washing machine and dryer.  SInce it fits tables seating 8-10 people ( or holding 5 feet by almost 8 feet, 8 inches worth of punch bowls, cups, saucers, casseroles, silverware, decorative animals, veggie burgers, etc., it's probably going into a large room where it won't overpower other decorative touches.For anyone who hosts a semi-big event once in a while, and who doesn't want to risk the emotional turmoil that accompanies a ruined expensive tablecloth (say, when wine or punch is spilled on it), this is a solid, attractive, practical alternative.

"The best feature here is the silky smooth, rich and natural bass; it's neither timid nor gimmicky - it's just a fine performance for bass lovers. (If you're not a bass lover, and you're used to cheaper earbud style phones, it may feel like too much: Earbuds often don't transmit bass very well. I really love the bass, but if you can't get used to it then hopefully you have an equalizer on your audio device.)  The sound is satisfying throughout the spectrum (although those who really like a lot of treble may find it lacking), not surprising given the 3Hz - 27kHz frequency response and the more-than-adequate 40mm dual diaghragm speakers. The lack of buzz and other iatrogenic noise is superior to many other speakers. Bravo, as they say.The unit is designed fairly well except for one flaw.  The weight is moderate (way more than your buds, but not as much as the big cans from Sony, for example), the cushioning at the ears and on the surface that touches your head, the size is adjustable (look closely and you can see where the earpiece can slide down).  They're comfortable, although comparable to other headphones in the $100 and up range (in my admittedly limited experience). However, for the performance, the overall weight and comfort level is fine. (At first, the tension of the phones is not as ""lightly sprung""  as claimed, but I expect this will loosen with time (or my hands slightly stretching it).There is a slight problem with the in-line volume, pause play, skip tracks, etc. controller:  It's too high to comfortably see or use when the controller is connected close to the headphones.  However, the line is detachable!  Just plug the controller end into your audio device and the other side into the phones, and now the in-line controller is more like bent-arm's lengh away.  I really appreciate having the in-line controls (I don't see them very often on cheaper phones), but at this price, one might expect left/right balance or maybe treble/bass control.  Perhaps I'm expecting too much.Being able to fold these up, and then pack them in an astonishingly lux case makes up for some of the deficits.  (I wonder how much this would cost with a cheapo pouch, or none at all.)  It's surprisingly light, well-padded, and has a half-case mesh compartment for storing the cord or whatever.  Very nice.Overall, I'm very pleased with the sound and overall quality.  Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to go out and compare other phones to this one, but it compares very favorably to the various Sony closed-end phones I've in the past.  You don't need huge headphones or ""boost"" features to get a great-sounding bass and full sound at the high end and middle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14AEFIJBNDOGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGGK7WE#wasThisHelpful","R14AEFIJBNDOGU","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to make up little drawing games when I was a YOUT, so the appeal of this was immediate.  Fortunately, a six-year old shared my enthusiasm.  Blue Orange designers created  an entertaining way for kids to practice motor skills, coordination, math, and many other cognitive abilities, all through playing a game with an adventure motif.  While story-telling is tangential to the object of the game, the different scenarios add to the fun and may encourage interactive play.  However, I also like that the game may be played alone as well as with others, in competitive or non-competitive play, and that kids of different ages seem to adapt it to their own level.

"Please, let's remember what this is not before casting aspersions.  It is not made of stain steel, it is not metal, not a thermos, nor is it dishwasher or microwave-safe.  It's your basic one-handed mug with double-walled plastic insulation, which will keep your coffee hot for maybe 30 minutes, after which it begins to cool.  It is best for a short commute, not for camping or even a 90-minute drive.It is also not a maggot habitat, contrary to the experience of one reviewer.  I don't doubt the veracity of that report, but I'm not sure the mug is at fault.  Yes, you should hand wash within a few hours of use, and then turn it upside-down to dry.  I've even left it a few days before washing with no ill effects. If you want to wash inside the lid (I don't think you have to), just press the raised circle under the lid and twist.This travel mug has a very nice grip, is sized well both in diameter and height, and does NOT spill if you turn the lid on tightly.  You may need to experiment with what makes for a tight seal; my one complaint is that several times it has felt sealed, but was not. SPILLAGE.  The problem is that you need to make sure that you've screwed the lid on evenly with the threaded top. If you don't, it may feel tight, but you've accidentally left a small gap. This should be easier than it is, but practice helps.  When the lid is on properly, you can turn this over and not spill a drop.It holds over 13 ounces, and is a bit taller than some containers.  You might want to test whether you'll have problems by placing a similarly sized container in your vehicle's beverage holder.  Mine tips over a bit, but has never fallen out.I love the true one-hand operation: Push down the orangy-red button in the center, and you've opened a passage for your coffee or tea or whatever.  That button stays down until you push it again; this closes it up.  That button closes very solidly; I don't get the feeling it's going to break any time soon.  The flow rate is also compatible with driving (but try not to drink while you're driving) because the liquid flows into your mouth at a reasonable rate.  Again, a little practice may help, but you're not likely to either splash your face, or raise the bottom towards the ceiling because the flow is too sloooow.You can (and maybe should) pay more for a higher standard of performance, or if you really have your mind set on the ""Coffee Makes Me Poop"" logo on one of the travel cups sold at Amazon.com.  However, for everyday use for short trips around town, you won't be investing much in another solid OXO product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQVE14QYTOY53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QJE43E#wasThisHelpful","RQVE14QYTOY53","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Watts Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid is a ""serum"" of several popular pro-skin ingredients* that, according to the company, ""works great pn aging skin, uneven skin tones, dry skin, blemishes and more."" Those popular ingredients include  a blend of unspecified organic herbs ( as an infusion), Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, MS), Organic Jojoba Oil, Green Tea, Geranium Essential Oil, and Vitamin C (as sodium ascorbyl phosphate.A quick search of Wikipedia cites two studies in which a minimal surgical procedure using Hyaluronic Acid reduced neck wrinkles, two cites on the use of Arginine in treating wounds, and that Vitamin C acts as an anti-oxidant (although it also acts as a pro-oxidant).But, this is NOT a scientific analysis, just as there has been no scientific double-blind studies of this product ( to my knowledge anyway).  Watts, at least, knows enough science to package this in a dark-colored bottle, to prevent oxidation.I suspect that results, both positive and negative, will vary, and that your experience may be the best predictor of whether this will work for you.  That, and perhaps your expectations (this will may me look 10 years younger vs. lower expectations). My own experience was as follows: This is quite light, although minimally oily upon first application, this dries after a short time. I experienced a slight pulling sensation as well, perhaps due to the witch hazel; again, not really noticeable after a while.My ""takeaway"" is that one should use this very sparingly, and certainly in a smaller dose than comes using the bottle's sprayer (although the spray is surprisingly precise).  I recommend spraying the hand, and then dipping one's finger into it for application.  A dropper would have been worth the extra time it takes to apply compared to the spray.  That's the primary reason I've given this a 4 instead of a 5 rating.As I said, I'm reluctant to offer a testimonial about dermal outcomes (I think I just made up a word).  The organic, cruelty-free (not tested on animals-great!) ingredients should perhaps be compared to what you've used in the past.  If this is new to you, I suggest getting the 1 ounce size.  It's less economical than the larger, but you won't risk as much money upfront in case this either has undesired results, or does not produce the results you expect. Not odor-free, there is a mild (and to me, pleasant) scent from the geranium oil,*Ingredient List.

"Remington's ""Hyper Flex"" technology is a bit gimmicky sounding, but it's basically a version of the floating rotary heads found on other electric razors, notably the Norelco ""Senso-Touch"" system.  Some Don Draper type really used indulged in his or her imagination for this hyperbole , but it's really no worse than the Norelco.It'c comparable to the Norelco as well.  Although not quite as sleek looking, you may prefer the monochromatic greys and black to the flash of Norelco's iridescent blue.Performance is fine.  Although electric razors will almost never shave as closely as the cheap throwback plastic safety razors, the floating heads do a good job of maintaining close contact with the skin.  Still, you may find that you  spend a lot of time on, say, your neck, only to discover that a cheapo BIC razor does it better.As others have mentioned, there is a plastic feeling, but my personal lab technicians feel that's quite possibly due to the plastic used.  If you want to spend $200, you can probably get away from this.  More importantly (for most), the Remington gives a close and comfortable shave, the features function as they should (e.g., the trimmer, the battery use indicator, wet/dry shaving, etc.), and placed where you'd expect themErgonomically, it feels balanced and light in the hand, with a solid grip.  It's cleaned with water, although a brush is provided as well. Some of my vast staff (not their weight, but how far-flung across the country they're located) felt that the charger/holder was *not* so intuitive, but others didn't have a problem.  In any event, you might want to test whether the balance of the razor when charging it inside the unit; you wouldn't want it tipping over.Overall, a very good shaver for the price that works well. It would be great for travel as well as home/office use.

"With 61 out of 92 people rating this a 4 or 5 out of a maximum of 5, I can'thonestly say that this is a bimodal distribution of those who love the Binder vs. those who Hate it, but there *is* quite a divergence of opinon on this product, the most serious of which seems to center on California's Prop. 65 law requiring labelling of products containing carcinogenic materials.  I didn't get this label, but apparently it's aimed at those who are pregnant, and this is quite discomforting to many, even those who are not ""with child.""  Let's go review this and other features and contrasting opinions.Stylish Beauty vs. Health Risk.This is one of the most stylish Binders I've seen at this price.  It's a rich blie with leather-like texture, and a stiched beige somewhat leather-like interior.  It's not a high-tech monochrome or black/silver combo; it has a warmer appearance that says, "" I care about how I present myself, but I'm not pretentious, and I don't need something ultra-modern or cooly understated. YET, that material (at least the exterior) is made from PVC-free polyproplyene (""polypro)"" and I believe it's the polypro that earns the Prop 65 warning.  It's true that you wouldn't know about the potential danger (here, according to the warning label that I didn't receive, to expectant mothers), but that's the whol epoint of Prop. 65: To warn you of potential toxicity that you wouldn't otherwise know about.  We see this all the time on glasses that may contain lead, some types of faux leather clothing, and many other products.  Unfortunately, I have not found a good website that explains why materials are on the list, and, especially, what kind of exposure is dangerous (e.g., is it dangerous if I nerely hold it or do I have to lick it, bite into it, does it leech out into the laundry, are there dangerous fumes, is the toxicity limited to it's manufacture rather than its use....etc.)  My own feeling is that this is certainly NOT an advantage. because, while not pregnant, these are the sort of questions that naturally occur to me.  A call to Wilson/Jomes might clarify all this.Design and Durability.  Part of the beauty is that this is a ""soft-shell"" binder, not one of those clunky, rigid notebooks that we lugged around at school. It's lighter, and has can stylishly conform to your grip and curve as you place it on a table.  Yet, this also means (probably) that it's not as durable as those rigid, somewhat clunky notebooks, such as Wilson-Jones' own Heavy Duty 3-ring binders.  Because of this, I recommend rhis more as a portfolio for short-term storage and presentation of documents, rather than a more permanent storage product.  In addition, the storage capacity is limited compared to other binders.Another durability issue:  The nice-looking cord that keeps the binder closed has already, after a very short period of time, produced creases where it wraps around the folder exterior.  This begins to detract from the elegance.Function:  As said before, this might be best to think of as a portfolio that can accomodate plain and hole-pinched papers.  There are two nice pockets for non-punched papers, and a 3-ring set-up for punched.  However, the 3 rings are small are not D-rings, this limits how much paper they can hold, and may affect durability (more pressure to open the rings).  With a small amount of paper stored for temporary use (before, say, moving to a more permanent storage product, this is probably not a problem; however, this is a limit of which one should be aware.The pockets are tightly sewn and come up about 1/3 or so up the vertical plane of the front and back covers.  Unlike others, I've seen no ""bubbles"" indicating poor manufacturing. The pen holder and ID (or other) holder are nice features, that give it a somewhat more expensive pedigree.Bottom Line. Putting aside the warning label for the moment, I might buy this Binder.  The drawback is the small size, some questions about durability, and the possibilty that for just $10 or $15 more, I might find something that I liked much better. The arguument for purchasing is the beautifully blue textured cover, the light weight, and a certain relaxed sophistication.  For some, the deal-breaker will be that pesky warning that the materials might have a health risk.  If Prop. 65 doesn't have a site that more readily describes the specifics, perhaps WIlson-Jones could add an insert explaining the risk (especiallywhat type of exposure creates it).  Otherwise, I recommend calling the company.  Personally, I'm not so bowled over by the overall product that I could practice some denial, and buy this figuring what I don't know won't hurt me.

"Best reason to buy this water bottle:  It keeps water cold, colder than any other water bottle I've owned (and I own/have owned several for general health and for outdoor activities).  It's steel, non-BPA, and vacuum-insulated, as others have noted. If you look forward to a refreshing cold drink of water, this is the one for you. And, yes, it is rugged, and doesn't ""sweat"" water from condensation, but most bottles don't.My enthusiasm is tempered by a few important design problems.  Most importantly, there is no sipper, unlike the Camelbak Eddy Bottle and other Camelbak products.  Not only do you have to tip the bottle up to let gravity do its work, but you have to press a release button (it's grey, you can see it in the photo) at the back.  This lets the water out (and keeps the cold in), but it's not easy to do this while you're engaged in some other activity (walking or kayaking, for example). Even though it doesn't get slippery and the shape is well-designed, there's no handle or rubberized grip; this compounds the difficulty.  I'm not saying it takes great dexterity to use the bottle, but these qualities are important to consider for this not inexpensive product.  Personally, I also wish it came in different sizes (like a 32-ounce), and overall, I prefer the one liter Camelbak, but the latter just can't compete with this one for keeping your water....

"""I'm not sure how much more she can take!""""Give her all you got, we're almost there!""""You only have a narrow 2-3 second window to pull down the lever!""~And those were just from the adults in the room! Three adults (including myself) recently made one of the Hot Wheels cars with the 5-year old son of our friend. It was a HUGE hit, and both the cute little boy and the (somewhat cute) adults were excited and pleased with the end result.The product comes with OK instructions; we had to go to the hotwheels.com/carmaker site listed on the package to figure out why the door to the mold-making machine would not stayed closed, resulting in the annoying repetition of a computerized voice repeating ""Error... error... error...""  Fortunately, the website (listed in the instructions) helped us resolve the problem (take out the wax stick, unplug it, and start over again).  Other than that, assembly was easy, fast, and without missing or non-fitting parts.You probably get the idea of how this works from the description and other reviews, so I'll be brief.  One places wax sticks at the top of the machine and waits for it to heat up (about 6-7 minutes), all the while watching lights flash and sound effect repeat.  This held the boy's attention for about 3-4 minutes; the adults tried to liven things up with the dumb jokes quoted above.  Once the mechanical voice announces that the machine is hot enough, depress the lever (within 2-3 seconds or who KNOWs what will happen! *smile*), and the waxy sticks melt into the car mold at that you've inserted at the bottom of the machine.  WAIT another eight or so minutes, and you'll hear that the cooling is complete and the door opens automatically.  This is VERY exciting after that waiting, but one still has to scrape off excess wax with the included plastic ""tool"" (if you lose this, many other objects will accomplish the same thing), loosen the now hardened car from the mold (not difficult), and then (easily) press it onto a prebuilt chassis, complete with working wheels. The waxen vehicle is richly colored (the purple has a very deep, almost metallic look; the finish does not look waxy or ""cheap"") and one finishes by adding decals onto the finished product. Oh, and then you get to play with it, too!The boy loved it, and held it in his arms when he left to go home.  HIs mom had to encourage him him to just lay it on the seat beside him as they drove home!A FEW THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW.1. DEMANDING. This 5-year old, a very intelligent boy with precocious small motor skills, could NOT have done this himself.  Even after memorization of the instructions, the manual dexterity required (ESPECIALLY with the decals) is beyond his capabilities, and so Mattel is right: Suggested minimum age is 8, and even at that age, someone may need assistance.  Not that our ""test subject"" minded, he enjoys playing with adults, but you should take into account your child's need to do things ""all by myself.""2. PATIENCE.  Just making the mold requires about 15 minutes, minutes that go by very slowly when you're so anxious to see the finished product. Mattel  tried to accommodate this with the flashing lights and sound effects, but even this was not enough to distract our budding engineer.  The answer is...COOKIES!!!  I think the best way to play with this is to have a distraction/alternative activity going on while you're waiting... a book, a plate of cookies, etc.Adding the decals is fun, but adds another 35-35 minutes of focused effort. We let the boy try his hand at selecting and placing the decals, but ultimately it was the adults who put them on.  A 5-yearold might not mind; an 8+ year old might.3. MORE ABOUT THOSE DECALS.  They're tiny, they're not keyed to the different molds (figuring out which window decal, as just one example, fit which car model was something the adults had a lot of difficulty with), and Mattel could have easily printed some extra material on this.  We relied on the pictures on the package, but there was a problem here too:  Not only were just a few decals shown on the two car models, but decals were shown that are NOT included in the set! (It showed a white spoiler, for example, and there is no such decal included). What a shame-this was an unnecessary problem.4. What's Included. Despite these flaws, the toy makes beautiful hot wheel vehicles (one of them is a little more like a truck). You have enough wax to  make up to 10 molded cars, but can play with only three at a time because that's how many chassis are included. However, if you tired of one model, just snap it off, and replace it with one of the others. Additional wax can be bought (of course) if your youngster wants a fleet of vehicles or is a budding entrepreneur.5. Quality and Performance. The machine worked, the cars look excellent, and the decals (when finally applied) make them look exciting and realistic. The wheels are solid and the car rolls around well. For younger kids that don't mind getting help (and for parents and adult friends who don't mind giving it), you'll get fine results (but remember, patience and/or alternative activies will help!).6. Value. Too expensive, as are most toys. Even with the current $10 dollar discount it seems overpriced by 5-10 dollars. However, the fact that it works, that there's nothing quite like it (that I know of, anyway), and that individual hot wheels can cost quite a bit add to the value, as does the safety of the machine. Adult supervision will be necessary in most cases (in my opinion), but the machines was NOT hot to the touch.  Mattel, in its heartfelt concern about kids' safety (and equally since desire to not get sued) has a list of safety precautions about as detailed as if this were a chemistry set.7. Bottom line.  There's a LOT to like about this set, and few problems with getting it to work. The big issue is whether the manual and psychological (e.g., patience, cooperating with older peers or adults) demands will mesh well with your child's skill level and personality. I'd also like to see the price come down a little more, but our sample boy sure did love this!  Now, if they could make a similar set that makes other toys, perhaps include an activity while you wait, and have better guidance on those decals, Mattel would make a lot of kids happy, and have a new hit toy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12NKK86LPK12L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKH9QWO#wasThisHelpful","R12NKK86LPK12L","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"270+ reviews on Phospho-Omega, a fish oil supplement derived from krill! For humans, there's little debate that fish oil is a potent source of Omega 3's polyunsaturated fatty acids, rich in anti-oxidants EPA and DHA, substances that help with the cardiovascular and perhaps other systems.  I've gathered that there's some debate over just how many conditions may be helped, but the current debate rages over the merits of krill (a kind of crustacean, like shrimp) vs. fish-derived forms.  I'm just glad that the whales, seals, fish, and birds who feed on krill are not similarly consumed by this controversy.My brief review (very brief, PLEASE consult your health care provider for accurate and thorough information) shows two primary camps. There are those (Dr. ""OZ"" is a popular proponent for this side) who claim superior benefits of krill-based products such as  better absorption and delivery of DHA to the brain (admittedly, in animal models), the additional antioxidant, astaxanthin, equal performance but at much lower doses ,better bio-sustainability and reduced toxins (because it's extracted at the bottom of the food chain and is harvested in cleaner oceans. This view is summarized at (among other website): [...]Not so fast say proponents of a more cautious view, who note that one of the most quoted studies was funded by a Krill Oil company(!). They note the uncertain state of current findings about the superiority of krill oil; indeed, both ""sides"" agree that there is far less research on krill than fish-based Omegas.  A Medscape article ([...]) notes that ""Preclinical animal research suggests that fish oil is more digestible and more efficiently incorporated into tissue than krill oil[5]; however, preliminary clinical research suggests that krill oil might have better bioavailability than fish oil,"" and that ""the comparative bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids from krill vs. fish oil is uncertain.""Even the more enthusiastic krill oil supporters use words like ""may benefit"" and ""seem to have beneficial effects.""  At least they're not claiming perfect knowledge.Other factors to consider wit areh either krill or fish oil gastrointestinal and other types of tolerabilities, although tolerability may be improved by strategies suggested in the Medscape piece.  The Medscape article states that krill oil ""long-term safety and the drug interaction profile are unknown,"" but that, in any case, those with shellfish allergies should not take krill oil.Tolerance will vary both within people (because of some of the adaptations one may use in consuming it) and between people, so it's probably not too informative to hear that I had no side effects (not even minor ones) with krill oil.  They were easy for me to swallow, but then, I'm an inveterate pill swallower (prescription only, of course). Krill oil capsules may be more expensive than fish oil, but the current Amazon.com price is more than 50% off list, and some people may be willing to pay more anyway.Perhaps the best thing you can do is to read literature that offers different perspectives, and, most importantly, to consult with a qualified health professional (not Amazon.com reviewers)!  If all this start to seem like too much work, I suggest taking a break by listening to ""Diamonds are a Krill's Best Friend,"" ""I Enjoy Being a Krill,"" or jazz pianist/singer, Diana Krill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E7BTRXXXF3EB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0072DAZEE#wasThisHelpful","R1E7BTRXXXF3EB","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent electric toothbrush priced between the better budget models (S40-$75) and the higher-end complete bells-and-whistles, retractable cord, auto-sanitizing, warning if you're using too much pressure, etc. models. Compared to those in the former category, this has much more power (yes, the brush does revolve faster, 31,000 RPM), has a wonderfully lightweight, ergonomic handle (for example, it's slimmer, with a longer reach to easily access all parts of your mouth), holds a charge for weeks and weeks (I really appreciate this feature when traveling; the manual states that a fully charged brush ""should provide 42 2-minute brushings,"" or about 3 weeks), and has several ""modes.""That last feature is somewhat questionable because Phillips does not specifically explain how the modes differ in their product manual. (see [...] )All we're told is that the user has a choice of five modes:""The five modes include a clean mode for an outstanding clean in two minutes. A sensitive mode for gentle yet thorough cleaning of the gums. A refresh mode for those quick one minute touch-ups. A massage mode to stimulate the gum and a gum caremode that helps improve gum health.""So what's the difference between massage mode to stimulate the gums and gum care mode?  As stated above, the clean mode runs at 31,000 rpm; what's the rpm for the sensitive mode? WHAT quick one-minute touch-ups, and why not just turn the brush on again after the automatic 2-minute shut-off, and run it for as long or as short as you want?Not that you'd necessarily want to do this, but you cannot change brushing modes in the middle of a brushing. That's not a drawback to me.  Like many models these days, the toothbrush breaks the 2-minute timed brushing into fourths by basically stopping every 30 seconds and immediately accelerating to full speed. IT's nice in theory (equal attention to all areas of the mouth) but after many weeks of using I still am reminded of the auto-shut off at the dentist's office, when your mouth accidentally grasps the hygienist's brush.  When the Phillips stops and starts, I keep thinking I've locked my mouth around it, when I haven't. This *is* annoying, and at least has improved with time. I'd prefer a design that slowed down very briefly.Buy this for these useful features:1. Power (31,000 RPM)2. Wonderfully slim, lightweight handle, and long well-designed brush.3. Relative long battery life.4. Whirring sound rather than jarring LOUD sound of some other toothbrushes.5. Battery indicator showing how much charge is left/how much more re-charging is needed, solid portable case.6. Results that you may notice, improved removal of surface stains, good ""mouth feel"" afterwards.As for the modes...I think it's over-rated.  At least try to sell it to me, Phillips, by telling me exactly how the speed and motion differs among them.  In my opinion, if you can get features 1-6 in a cheaper model, you might prefer that. Overall, and despite my ranting about the modes, this has been my favorite (well, and most expensive) of the several electric brushes I've owned.Bottom line, ASK YOUR DENTIST or trusted HYGIENIST if this is the right brush for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NCYRHICLP6T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUG273A#wasThisHelpful","R1NCYRHICLP6T0","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't vouch for the Iphone capabilities of these phones (I dare not call them by any modern slang, like cans), but others have written about a rather impressive lineup of features that (microphone input to phone, music pause, etc.) that seem to function very well.The look is either gonna completely turn you off (unless you love white accessories--belts, polo shirts, buckskin shoes--or you have a sense of humor about them; sometimes something can be so blatantly uncool that it becomes hip in its defiance of trends. At any rate, that's how I prefer to think of these.It should be a foregone conclusion that these will be more comfortable and produce better sound than those awful earbud ""headphones"" that do nothing but fall out of one's ear. Perhaps others like earbuds (EWWW, even sounds like earwigs, the bug) because they stay in their ears and they're certainly lightweight.  These are lighter than some of the non-earbud designs; I found them comfortable and stable.  I happen to like the ""old school"" two lines descending from the phones; it's consistent with the unconventionality of the look.The sound is very good, not as good as a pair of $80 speakers without all the ipod/iphone interfaces that these have.  You also sacrifice some quality versus the closed ear phones, but that may be a personal preference, and, of course, that would add to the weight. I do think these headphones cost a bit too much at full price, if you can, wait until a sale.  Right now, for example, they're selling at a hefty discount.

"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers here, the basic elements--the camera and the speakers---work well, not premium ""boardroom"" quality (whatever that is) but well enough for most conference and personal uses. Note: If you have an actual boardroom chances are price is not an issue and you'll likely buy something even more expensive. As noted by ""Nerd"" this is optimalized for conference because of the depth of field and sound features. However, it also works fine with Skype for person-to-person communication.  The price is probably not worth the features, however, if that's all you're going to use it for.  The 4 months of free OmniJoin Web conferencing is a nice pitch to those considering the full subscription, but at $500 annually (approximately), you shouldn't let that sway your purchase decision unless you have some direct (or word-of-mouth) experience, and feel fairly sure you're going to subscribe.

"The Fire is not ""below,"" perhaps, but at least very securely between the two sleek and smooth black front and back covers of this sturdy, high quality storage and carrying case for the Kindle Fire HD 7"".THe product does exactly what it should.  It holds your Kindle securely at the four corners with some triangular shaped elastic that you lift and stretch over the four corners. The last corner will be a tight fit and will take more effort (think of putting the last corner of a fitted sheet over a mattress), but the resulting hold power is worth it. (In fact, I tried my much smaller Kindle paperwhite reader and the fit was so tight that it usually held, despite very little coverage of the tips of the Paperwhite. However, do NOT rely on this product to secure the Paperwhite reader, the dimensions are for the Fire). As other reviewers did, I gave the case several shakes while open and the Fire did not move.The case acts as a stand in a very simple manner, just arrange the covers to form a V (with the Fire pointing outward, of course!) and rest the cover along the two edges. The edges have a rubbery-type fabric that hold the case up well. It would have been nice to have this same material along the spine of the Fire cover for added grip: I think it's probably safest to carry this, if a purse, bag, or briefcase is not handy, with the ""open side"" up (i.e. not the binding side, as in a book) to take advantage of the grip surface along the edge.THe outside is a beautiful combination of traditional and modern styles; the overall effect is a dark black with a very subtle mosaic in darn brown crosshatch. It is NOT loud or garish; neither is it sleek and techno,  The cover is nicely secured by an elastic band that fits into a smooth inset so that it is more flush with the cover.I had NO problem with any ports being covered by the elastic corner binding (unlike another reviewer here).  All ports, on-off buttons, slots for recharging, etc. were available for use!Overall, this is a very useful and well-built cover.  I think the price is high by about $5.00, so buy something else if you can find something that costs less but with the same quality and functionality (or, if having a cover that can act as a stand is not important, you might want to look at other products).  However, given the cost of your Fire and the features of this cover, the slightly high price is probably worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JG7ABTI1UHC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOTAI0I#wasThisHelpful","R1JG7ABTI1UHC9","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a feature rich FM clock radio that plays Apple devies with far richer sound than, for example, the Philips AJ7030D/37 30-Pin iPod/iPhone Alarm Clock Speaker Dock.  Although about twice the size as the amaller Phillips, the sound (paritularly the bass and mid-range) is mull fuller and richer sounding, while still at a relatively budget-mided price point. It's so laded with features that I'll enumerate and evaluate them below:1. Plays FM radio, although with an externnal antenna (i.e., a wire( that must be stretched and pointed in an optimal direction for best reception.  Even so, FM reception is only passable (but will depend greatly on your location). In my experience , perhaps the weakest feature.1a. There's six radio presets, nice if you'r ein the mood for something different, or if you r station isn't comin in well.2. Charges Ipds, Ipads, Iphones.  These devices fit easily on the device (I've had some trouble with others) and they're recharged quickly.  Functions well.3. Equalizer, THis feature will affect both the FM radio and your docked device with independent settings ranging  from -5 to -5 for treble and for bass. Unfortunately there's no midrange, so turning up the treble or the bass will not solve all sonic problems. Still, a nice feature to have (although the 3D Sound feature doesn'--im my opinon, do a whole lot.4. Clock and alarm.  The clock will synch to an attached device, OR you can naually set the time yourself.  There are two alarms and these havve ""snooze (let me sleep a little while longer!),"" and sleep functions. Yu can deploy the ""bedtime button"" to gently lower the volume of your device as you drift off to sleep. This is incremental, not continuous( i.e., it will play for 120.90.60.30 or 15 mintes).  A nice feature is that you can independently adjust the sleep mode and the alarm volume.  In addition to the two alarm customizations (which can be set to precisely the time at which you want to wake, there's a ""Nap"" feature that wakes you by the default buzzer alarm. Like the sleep feature, this is set incremnatlly rather tha n continuously *your choices -- 5, 10. 15, 20, 40,45. 60, 90, or 120 minutes.5. There is an audio output line to connect the radio to exteranl speakers!6. Please note that the unit does NOT run on batteries, although it has battery backup.A good unit, especially for MP3 nd other music players with a nice complement of clock (includes a calendar, by the way) and alarm features.

"My Kindle and Ipod type devices have limited storage (just didn't want to pay more) and the Seagate Wireless Plus 1 TB Mobile Device Storage (with Built-In Wi-Fi Streaming) is perfect for storing a tremendous amount of media (one full terrabyte of storage,; ""500 movies or thousands of songs, photos and documents.""), and bringing it along with your media your player of choice (for me, several Kindle devices and an Ipod touch).

"This not-so-little shaver must sing the praises of the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor, (3 Count).This was one of the closest and most comfortable shaves I've had in the disposable razor category . (I also own electric razors and s Merkur safety razor--I keep getting these as gifts!)Rather than just another gimmick, the 5 blades work very effectively in removing facial and neck hair; I do feel all that copy about 'pulling up the hair' so that he next razor can cut it has vailidity.  This is a very close shave.Other positives. The grip and feel are comfortable and--dare I say it--ergonomically designed. For difficult to reach places, one can place a thumb just beinf the protected razor for added pressure and precision. The gel-lle hadnle covering is easy on the hand, and some well-placed grooves prevent slippng. The raxor glides smoothly over the face, but--make no mistake--this raxzor takes no mercy either.Cons.  This is a little more difficult to clean than other razors because of the five blades, Additonally, removing the blade for cleaning can be quite challenging--better to use a force water flow, and perhaps a toothpick to remove hair found behind the blade.Bottom line.

"Although a little pricey (hey, take off ANOTHER five dollars and it'll be fairly proced), this is a very well-made, compact yet roomy, highly water resistant velcro-sealing pouch for your Kindle. In my experience, I've had no problem fitting the Kindle into the ""jacket""; in fact, I can just stuff the power cord into the extra pocket. (There's one pocket with a clear screen into which one places the Kindle, and another pocket with no screen into which one can place a stylus, pen, post-its, whatever--even the power cord (although with difficulty). Yes, it could have been bigger, but then you trade off some of its easy portability and slim profile for storing, packing, etc.A reviewer stated that the Kindle does not fit well into the jacket if you already have a protective skin around its back.  I suppose if the skin is thick enough (for example, those with textured backs) this might be a problem. It is not insurmountable, however.  If you MUST use both a skin and the jacket while traveling; for example, you could probably take the skin off and store it in the second pocket.  This is perhaps a minor hassle, and thick skins may not fit, but it's worth the rick of having to return it. (Amazon.com has a fantastic return policy. I recently returned an item and customer service answered quickly, answered all questions thoroughly and courteously, and promptly sent me a postage -paid label via email.)BOTTOM LINE. This works well and delivers what it promises (don't take it underwater).  If you're concerned about whether your skin-protected Kindle will fit; either remove the skin or return the product.  The slim profile and ease of use (it has a built-in ""handle"" with some utility) make this a worthwhile accessory for the Kindle owner--now, if only they'd lower the price to around 25-27 dollars.

"Yes, it's true, there are NO BUBBLES when you place this on top of your Kindle Fire (non High-Definition models), mostly due to its weight and amazing adhesive qualities.  It attaches and can be removed with equal ease.On balance, however, I think the Moshi iVisor Anti-Glare screen protector does not deliver all it claims. I can't really recommend it. Let's get to the usual PROs and CONs and I'll tell you on what I base this opinion.PROs.1. Attaches and removes easily from your KINDLE screen.2. No bubbles (between the screen amd the Moshi protector) when you place the screen protector on your Kindle.3. Fits over entire screen and made of sturdy material.A PRO and One Big CON3. Cuts down on reflective glare, but not ""OVERALL GLARE.""  A glaring (pun completely intended) problem with the Kindle is the great difficulty with reading text on it when outside. I'm referring to two types of glare: OVERALL GLARE (glare that washes out the contrast of the text on the background so that text on the entire screen is difficult to read), and SPECIFIC REFLECTIVE GLARE (SRG; reflected images that interfere with reading text in some parts of the screen.As an example of ""specific reflective glare"" imagine that you're reading from your Kindle on a bright day outside. Very likely you will see the reflection of your face bouncing back at you from the screen, obscuring much of it.  The Moshi does a good job of cutting down this type of glare.HOWEVER... The Moshi Screen Protector does not do much to cut down ""overall glare,"" --the non-specific glare that reduces the legibility of the entire screen.CONs.1. The biggest problem is the unresolved problem with ""OVERALL GLARE"" (see above). It's fine that the product reduces specific reflective glare (SRG), but it is not sufficient to make text easily visible.2. Reduced Visibility.  This is another problem with the product; it reduces contrast and how bright the text appears on the screen. I feel that any reduction in SRG is offset by reduced visibility--and I tested this with the BRIGHT feature up to 90% capacity and a larger-than-usual font.3. Perhaps the most annoying problem is DA--""Dust Attraction.""  Sure, with the supplied cloth you can clean your Kindle screen and the protector, but then you must act fast to place the protector before dust and other airborne thingees adhere to the side which sticks to the Kindle.  I could manage this with practice, but those same airborne thingees stick to the outside of the screen protector as well!  Even if you begin with a clean screen, the DA will eventually leave an annoying amount of dust, animal hair, whatever, on top of the screen.BOTTOM LINE.Look elsewhere, unless you absolutely cannot find a screen protector that leaves no bubbles, and if you plan to use your Kindle indoors primarily, and if you have limited dust, etc. flaoting around. I was quite disappointed; perhaps the next iteration of this product (assuming there is one) will show improvement.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ENZZGACLJQOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079UAT0A#wasThisHelpful","R2ENZZGACLJQOA","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How this product can be so strong on dirt and stains and yet be eco-friendly is a mystery to me, but, they've done it!  There's a variety of products in the pack, but I found the spray particularly useful for removing fresh stains off of upholstery, etc., and the apres-gasoline wipes are generously filled with liquid and work well to remove odor, etc.My spouse didn't like the pull-up/jerk method of dispensing the towelettes; it takes a little practice if ou;re not used to it.  She also felt that they might be somewhat too strong for general hand-cleaning.  However, I think you'll find plenty of more heavy-duty uses for these products, and they're both strong and wonderfully portable: I keep wipes and the spray cleaner handy when I'm on a trip, for example.

"After going through many electric razors in the $30 to $100 range, I have now found a new favorite, and it's not even a rotary!This Panasonic gives me the closest shave I've experienced, around ALL areas of the face and neck, and with no burn, snags, or other problems. It's loaded with USEFUL featuresm including a percent power remaining indicator, a pop-up trimmer that actually works, a lock,a razor head that detaches for EASY cleaning and re-attaches firmly and easily, and extremely quick recharging (I went from 0 to full power in less than one hour).I previously liked the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue, it also works smoothly and efficiently, but there's no question that the Panasonic gives a closer shave, and includes much better features.  The Phillips has a pop-up trimmer, but it's not part of the shaver, you have to store it until ready for use.  Besides the closer shave (the sine non quo of shaving), the Panasonic is much easier to clean, and is moreforgiving of user error (I accidently broke the head of the Philips when trying to clean it for the first time).ONE complaint.  This is one LOUD shaver.  Not motorcyle or electric mower loud, but I suppose all that power comes at a price.  If you shave in the same room with someone who's trying to sleep or read or otherwise concentrate, they will NOT share your enthusiasm for this shaver.  I close the bathroom door or shave while driving (I know, EWWWWW....), and I don't consider it a ""deal-breaker,"" but you should know there is a trade-off.

"Yes, it's feature-loaded, but so are Leggo's and Playskool tool kits. If you're not the superficial type, the somewhat cheap, plastic-looking (OK, it's not technically plastic, but very snthetic and looks it)housing and dayglow colors beg one to not take this watch seriously.However, that would be a mistake, because the features *are* useful, especially for those who want to use the multi-function stopwatch/lap (up to 49 laps). Other functions I appreciate are TWO dependable alarm settings (not too loud, not too soft), ""regular"" and miltary (""Roger, that's 14 hundred hours, Captain!"") displays, light watchband with venting holes (yes, polyurethane does have its advantages...), two watchband keepers (those things a belt or band goes through to stay put) data display capability--this just means you can review your lap/split times.The other MAJOR problem (inherent to some extent in multi-function watches) is related to the instructions, printed in relatively small print on a cardboard inset.  The instructions are somewhat complex, they're condensed because of space limitations, and more diagrams would have helped. Over time (no punintended...) AND if you use it enough, eventually you'll memorize how to actually *use* the functions; until then, make a photocopy and keep it in a safe place!I feel it's only fair to ding this product for its high price/appearance ratio and challenging instructions. Perhaps it's not realistic, but this looks like a 30-35 dollar watch, rather than a $50 and up watch (depending on whether there's a sale).  If money is not an object anyway, I'd prefer a more ""professional"" looking watch, but perhaps years of living in a suburb have made a snob out of me...","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15GKGDM2SRSC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006SZ61KO#wasThisHelpful","R15GKGDM2SRSC2","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hate to spoil the love-fest here, but I had nothing but trouble with this.  Most annoyingly, I couldn't get it to fit my Kindle Fire. Second most annoying?  It didn't charge my Ipod Nano.  Now I'm not so vain that I would discount human error (i.e., mine), but I tried several times and had the same frustrating result.  It is also possible, of course, that I simple received one of the few units that was defective.Aside from that, I didn't particularly like the design: It's fussy and not the connections are not as intuitive as they could be.  Based on the other reviews, this is probably a good purchase--and certainly a VERY useful product--but, based on my experience, I would recommend buying this only if you're syre it can be returned. Fortunately, I believe that is the case with Amazon! : )","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAJ164ZKTYQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005WKKIGO#wasThisHelpful","R3BAJ164ZKTYQL","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Lock and Lock"" really did it right with these food storage containers--they have most of the qualities that consumers want and sometimes get--but not all in one product.  The resume for the Lock and Lock Containers is impressive.PROs:1. BPA-free, a chemical you'd probably prefer to stay away from.2. Airtight, thanks to the small blue silicon tubing that fits neatly on the underside of the lid.3. Waterproof, EACH side has a single or double-latch that holds firmly, yet is EASY to unlatch; round containers also have 4 latches, at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 'o clock positions (go on--hold it upside-down!)4. Washable, by hand or machine (best if you do fairly soon after (like any dish or container).5. Solid, attractive look.  These are NOT flimsy looking, and feel solid and well-constructed. The appearance is slightly ""fogged,"" so that it softens the appearance of the food inside, although you can see the contents clearly.6.Microwave safe, but only for warming, not cooking from a raw state. You'll notice that solid construction when you see that the containers don't seem to melt or soften in the microwave.CONs:1. They're stackable, which means they're not as likely to topple over in your cupboard, but they do not fit inside of one another (which would save more space).2.  With foods that stain, this is less stain-resistant than the more expensive ""Lock and Lock Bisfre"" line Lock&Lock 77.8-Fluid Ounce Bisfree Rectangular Container, 9-1/2-Cup The Bisfre is more expensive, but you might want to add one or two to your collection for two reasons, 1) To add a larger capacity container (this collection should lit most individual needs, or a small side dish for2-4 people, but lacks a huge capacity container, and 2) If you have a heavily-staining food, use the Bisfre instead. This collection would be better with a little more variety in container shape and size, but--other than the humongous capacity category--it covers most of what you'll need, especially for families needing extra containers for lunches, etc.3. OK, I'm really quibbling here, but when they say 28-piece, 14 container in the product title, concentrate on the 14 containers. Those extra 14 ""pieces"" are merely the 14 lids for the 14 containers!Overall, an impressive, feature-rich collection of food storage containers that should meet almost all of your needs. Excellent sealing and solid construction!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MXP6YMX6YMBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054PHG2Q#wasThisHelpful","R3MXP6YMX6YMBO","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This copier-scanner-FAX machine performs all functions well and has come WAY down in price, making it a solid purchase for one needing all three functions. For those not needing a scanner, I recommend the Canon PIXMA MG6120 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-in-One Printer (4503B002) which also has a much lower price than a year or so ago. Like the Canon, this is a six-color printer, only here it's  regular cyan and light cyan, regular magenta and light magenta, yellow, and black mix. Copy reproduction is excellent, and even photos excel relative to the price. (You might want to look at pricier, photo-specialized copiers for optimal quality).Like the aforementioned Canon, the Epson has two paper trays (a slide-out, and a convenient top-loader. You can scan to your own computer in JPG or PDF format, and send scans, but ONLY if the receiving computer that has Espn drivers. Wired and wireless modes work well, and set-up was relatively easy (it always takes me longer than I think it will). My biggest complaint (and again, this applies to my comparison model, the Canon PIXMA MG6120 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-in-One Printer--without scanner--that I owned before this) is that you can't print once one of the ink colors has run out. So, if you're out of magenta, and you just want to print in black and white--you're out of luck!  I can't think of any reason why printers are designed this way other than to force you to buy all the colors in a timely (to the company) fashion.Lastly, this is a rather big and heavy machine. The weight isn't as much a problem (you're only going to lift it once, probably) as the dimensions: Make sure it will fit on whatever surface you plan to place it. AN excellent multifunction printer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29U8X5LMWUQYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HFJFK4#wasThisHelpful","R29U8X5LMWUQYF","A1SYLII0808HD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SYLII0808HD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
